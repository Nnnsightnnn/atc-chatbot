INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

Call them the skilled gentlemen and ladies.

Some prefer to keep to the silence and the shadows,

avoiding attention while plying their trade. Others love

to display their talents, basking in the adoration of the

public. They arc rogues and bards, and they often make

the  difference  between  success  and  failure  for  their

companions.

As  one  of  these  highly  skilled  individuals,  you

have a special place in any adventuring parry. Let the

 ghters, barbarians, rangers, and monks charge into

combat  when  danger  threatens.  Let  the  wizards  and

sorcerers  hang  back  to  cast  their  spells  from  a  safe

distance.  Let  the  clerics,  paladins

and  druids  keep  the  party  in

line  and  provide  the  healing

that keeps everyone going. Your

approach is subtler and more

oblique. If youre a rogue, you

know  how  to  set  up  the  the

best  possible  shot-a  surgi-

cal  strike  that  leaves  your

foe  in  a  world  of  hurt.

If  youre  a  bard,  you

thrive  as  a  jack-of-

all-tradesyou  have

good  combat  skills,  a

nice array of spells,

a knack for getting

along  with  others,

and

special  powers

that  improve  the  talents  of  your  companions.  Quite

simply  put,  those  who  adventure  without  a  rogue

in their midst tend to have a lot of traps blow up in

their faces, while those in a party with a bard become

better at whatever they do.

WHAT THIS BOOK IS

AND IS NOT

This  book  examines  rogues  and  bards  in  depth  and

offers new ways to develop them. All this material per-

tains to the new edition of the Dungeons &  Drag-

ons  game.  Here  you  will   nd  new  feats,  rules,  and

prestige classes, as well as useful advice for getting the

most out of your rogue or bard.

This  supplement  is  designed  to  mesh  with  the  rules

system  presented  in  the  three  core  D&D  rulebooks:  the

Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide and Monster

Manual. Nothing here supersedes or replaces the rules or

information presented there, except where noted.

This book provides options rather than restrictions

for play. Take and use what you like, modify anything

you wish, and ignore the rest. Players should ask their

Dungeon Masters (DMs) about incorporating elements

of this book into existing campaigns before making any

changes to their player characters (PCs). DMs can also

use the rules, classes, and magic items presented here

to develop interesting nonplayer characters (NPCs).

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

Song and Silence provides a variety of tools for customiz-

ing your bard or rogue character. New prestige classes,

new  feats,  new  equipment,  and  new  organizations  let

you  personalize  your  characters  and  enhance  their

roles in adventuring groups.

All  this  information  pertains  equally  to  PCs

and NPCs, so both players and DMs can

make full use of it. Any place names

mentioned here are drawn from the

D&D  world  as  de ned

in  the  D&D  Gazetteer;

DMs  using  other  cam-

paign settings can simply

replace

these  names

with  others  of  their

choice.

Chapter  1  presents

ten new prestige classes

especially  appropriate

for rogues and bards. Each class offers a unique direction

for character development.

Chapter 2 features an array of new feats that expands

the  capabilities  of  any  bard  or  rogue.  Also  presented

here are some new ways to use existing skills.

Chapter 3 details a plethora of new equipment for rogues

and bards, from musical instruments to new magic items.

Chapter  4  describes  thieves  guilds  and  bardic  col-

leges. Membership in one of these groups can provide

a bard or rogue with allies as well as other bene ts.

Chapter 5 places your character in context with the

rest of the campaign world. It also offers hints on uti-

lizing special combat maneuvers, such as  anking and

sneak attacks, to best advantage.

Finally, Chapter 6 lists new spells for bards and assas-

sins.  Besides  enhancing  their  regular  abilities,  these

spells help to set those classes apart from others.

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

CHAPTER I:

PRESTIGE

CLASSES

A  dread  pirates  lifestyle   ts  most  rogues  to  a  tee,

for  the  job  requires  a  number  of  skills  that  members

of  other  classes  dont  have  the  time  or  inclination  to

learn.  However,  the  class  is  also  attractive  for  som e

spellcasters, who can use magic to conceal their ships

or incapacitate a prize vessels crew.

How do you do that?

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

Lidda

Rogues and bards, the games ultimate skill-users, are

ideal candidates for advancement into prestige classes.

The ten classes presented here are of particular inter-

est to rogues and bards, although any character

who  meets  the  requirements  is  welcome  to

adopt one.

DREAD PIRATE

Thugs and cutthroats in every port lay claim to the title

pirate, but actually making a fortune through piracy

is no easy task. A dread pirate, however, has mastered

every aspect of larceny on the high seas. His network

of  contacts  tells  him  when  a  particularly  valuable

cargo is shipping out. After a  awless ambush at sea, he

swings aboard the target ship on a rope, rapier in hand.

Once he and his shipmates have overpowered the prize

vessels  crew,  they  liberate  the  cargo  and  make  their

escape.  Later,  the  dread  pirate  meets  representatives

from the black market in some isolated cave and sells

his newly acquired cargo for a handsome pro t.

Some dread pirates accomplish their goals

through  fear,  killing  indiscriminately  and

ruling  their  ships  at  rapier-point.  Others

minimize bloodshed and exhibit a curious

sort  of  chivalry,  perhaps  realizing  that  the

captain  and  crew  of  a  prize  ship  are  more

likely to surrender if they believe theyll live

to see port again. Now and then a dread pirate

takes his chivalric streak a step further and preys only on the

ships of enemy nationsor even solely on other pirates.

Class Features

Class Features

All the following are class features of the dread pirate

prestige  class.  The  Dif culty  Class  (DC)  for  any

required skill check is included where appropriate.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  A  dread  pirate

is  pro cient  with  simple  and  martial  weapons  and

with light and medium armor. If he is wearing light,

medium, or no armor, he can  ght with two weapons

as if he had the feats Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon

Fighting. A dread pirate most often  ghts with a rapier

and either a short sword or a dagger in his offhand. If

he  has  no  magical  means  of  swimming  in  armor,  he

usually goes unarmored, at least while aboard ship.

Fearsome  Reputation:  At  2nd  level,  the  dread

pirate  is  developing  a  reputation  on  the  high  seas.  At

this point, he must decide whether to adopt the hon-

orable pirates code (avoid undue bloodshed and focus

on cargo, not mayhem) or take the more bloodthirsty,

dishonorable  approach.  Unless  he  is  going  incognito,

the  dread  pirate  gains  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on

Diplomacy checks (if honorable) or Intimidate checks

(if  dishonorable).  Every  two  dread  pirate  levels  there-

after, this bonus increases by +2. Failure to live up to

his reputation at any point may (at the DMs discretion)

negate these bonuses.

Rope  Swing  (Ex):  If  a  number  of  overhead  ropes

or  booms  are  nearby  (and  on  a  ship,  they  almost

always  are),  a  dread  pirate  of  3rd  level  or  higher  can

grab one and swing up to 20 feet in a straight line as

a move-equivalent action or as the movement portion

of a charge action. If the dread pirate makes a success-

ful  Use  Rope  check  (DC  15),  this  movement  doesnt

provoke  attacks  of  opportunity  for  moving  through

threatened squares. A successful Use Rope check (DC

25) allows the character to move up to 20 feet through

occupied squares without provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity.  Failure  in  either  case  means  the  dread  pirate

6

swings through the desired area but provokes attacks

of opportunity normally. Rope swing can be used on

land as well-in a room with a tapestry or chandelier, for

example.

Players using the variant rules for Tumble (see Chapter

2) should apply the same variant to rope swing.

Wind  at  Your  Back:  At  3rd  level,  the  dread  pirate

has  become  a  master  at  eking  every  bit  of  propulsion

out  of  the  prevailing  winds.  Any  ship  he  captains

moves 1 mile per hour faster than normal.

Leadership  Bonus:  At  5th  level,  the  dread  pirate

gains a +2 bonus to his character level for the purpose

of  acquiring  cohorts  with  the  Leadership  feat.  Every

two dread pirate levels thereafter, this bonus increases

by +2.

Shifting Deck: As a free action, a dread pirate of 5th

level  or  higher  can  attempt  a  Balance  check  (DC  15).

Success negates any penalties for uneven ground, such

as a ships deck in rolling seas, and any higher-ground

bonuses that opponents might otherwise have. The DM

may set a higher DC for checks involving particularly

uneven or dangerous ground.

Come About: The dread pirates ability to maneuver

a vessel is legendary. At 6th level, he gains a +4 insight

bonus on Profession (sailor) checks.

Concealed  Weapon  Attack:  A  dread  pirate  often

hides  small  daggers  up  his  sleeves  or  in  his  boots.

At  7th  level,  a  dread  pirate  who  doesnt  already  have

the  sneak  attack  ability  gets  it  now  at  a  +2d6  damage

bonus,  but  he  can  use  it  only  to  make  sneak  attacks

with concealed weapons. If the character does have the

sneak attack ability from a previous class, the damage

bonuses  stack  only  for  sneak  attacks  made  with  con-

cealed weapons.

Hoist The Black Flag (Sp): The unique insignia of a dread

pirate of 8th level or higher is so well known that when

it is displayed on a  ag or banner, every ally within 50

feet of it gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks. This bonus

lasts for 10 rounds after the  ag is revealed, or until it is

destroyed or lowered, whichever occurs  rst. Hoist the

black  ag may be used three times per day, and the dread

pirate must either hoist the  ag personally or hand it to

an ally who then hoists it.

Scourge  of  the  Seas:  A  10th-level  dread  pirates

exploits  have  become  so  legendary  that  hundreds  of

able  sailors  are  willing  to  sign  on  as  his  crew  for  no

compensation  other  than  a  share  of  the  booty.  High-

level dread pirates can use this in ux of sailors to crew

pirate   eets  of  up  to  a  dozen  ships.  Any  small  citys

dock district has enough sailors (1st-level warriors and

experts) to crew a single ship, and a larger city can pro-

vide the crew for an entire  eet. This ability is separate

from the Leadership feat; crew members acquired with

the scourge of the seas ability dont count as cohorts or

followers.

DUNGEON DELVER

In  many  ways,  the  dungeon  delver  is  the  ultimate

expression  of  the  adventuring  rogue.  He s  skilled  at

moving stealthily through all types of dungeon terrain,

detecting and disarming inconvenient traps, bypassing

locks, locating treasure, and  lching protected items.

The typical dungeon delver has forsaken people skills

to concentrate on the nuts and bolts of dungeon explo-

ration  and  treasure  retrieval.  Rogues  make  excellent

dungeon  delvers,  as  do  the  rare  bards  and  rangers  who

choose to pursue this track. (Most bards would miss their

admiring audiences, however, and rangers might  nd it

dif cult to acquire all the necessary skills.)

Since  a  dungeon  delver  frequently  works  alone,  he

must  learn  to  think  and  act  independently,  relying

upon no one but himself. Even when exploring a dun-

geon  in  the  company  of  other  adventurers,  he  often

keeps to himself-scouting ahead, disarming traps a safe

distance from the group, or seeking treasure while the

others are distracted.

The  best  dungeon  delvers  become  legends  and  are

sought after by anyone with a particularly inaccessible

treasure to recover. Some even accept regular stipends

from various nobles to leave their treasures alone. Only

the  best  dungeon  delvers  survive  to  make  names  for

themselves,  however.  Those  who  lack  the  necessary

skill  and  savvy  perish  anonymously  on  unsuccess-

ful  expeditions,  leaving  behind  their  bones  for  some

luckier compatriot to discover.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

Requirements

To qualify as a dungeon delver, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Skills:  Climb  10  ranks,  Craft  (stonemasonry)  5

ranks,  Disable  Device  10  ranks,  Hide  5  ranks,  Move

Silently 5 ranks, Open Lock 10 ranks, Search 10 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Blind-Fight.

Special:  To  become  a  dungeon  delver,  a  character

must  rst survive a great trial underground. This usu-

ally takes one of three forms:

A  solo  dungeon  expedition  that  earns  the  charac-

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

ter  one-half  of  the  experience  points  needed  for

advancement to the next level. (For example, a 7tli-

level character must earn 3,500 XP on such a solo

run.)  The  character  must  complete  the  venture  in

one  week,  though  he  may  leave  the  dungeon  and

return as often as desired during that time.

Survival  of  a  cave-in  or  other  collapse  (see  Cave-

Ins and Collapses in Chapter 4 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Living  for  a  year  without  seeing  the  light  of  the

sun, usually among underground denizens such as

the deep dwarves or drow.

Class Features

Class Features

All the following are class features of the dungeon delver

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Dungeon  delvers

are pro cient with all simple and martial weapons, as well

as with light armor.

Danger  Sense:  The  dungeon  delver  possesses  an

uncanny intuition that warns him of impending danger.

This  grants  him  a  +2  insight  bonus  on  Re ex  saves  to

avoid traps, a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by

traps,  and  a  +4  insight  bonus  on  Spot  checks  made  to

spot creatures at the beginning of an encounter (see the

Encounter Distance rules in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide). At 6th level, these bonuses increase to

+4, +4, and +6, respectively.

Traps: At 1st level, the dungeon delver acquires the

traps ability if he does not already have it from a previ-

ous  class  (see  the  Rogue  section  in  Chapter  3  of  the

Players Handbook).

Blindsight  (Ex)  :  At  2nd  level,  the  dungeon  delver

gains acute sensitivity to sounds, smells, movement, and

other disturbances within 20 feet. This enhanced spatial

sense  enables  him  to  maneuver  and   ght  as  well  as  he

can  under  normal  conditions,  regardless  of  the  ambient

lighting.  Invisibility  is  irrelevant,  though  the  character

cannot  sense  ethereal  creatures.  Blindsight  does  not

replace normal vision. Activating this ability is a standard

action, and the effect lasts for 10 minutes. This ability is not

dependent upon hearing, so deafness and similar effects

do not negate it. At 8th level, the dungeon delvers blind-

sight range increases to 40 feet.

Stonecunning  (Ex)  :  A  3rd-level  dungeon  delver

gains the stonecunning ability. This functions exactly as

it does for dwarves (see Dwarf in Chapter 2 of the Players

Handbook), except that the check modi ers are compe-

tence bonuses rather than racial bonuses.

Reduce  (Sp):  At  4th  level,  the  dungeon  delver  can

squeeze through narrow crevices, half-collapsed passages,

prison  bars,  and  other  tight  spots  that  would  normally

block a character of his size and bulk. This ability, usable

three times a day, works exactly like a reduce spell cast by

a 5th-level sorcerer.

Darkvision (Sp): At 5th level, the dungeon delver gains

the ability to use darkvision at will, with a range of 60 feet.

If he already has darkvision as a class feature or racial abil-

ity, the ranges do not stack.

8

Treasure Sense (Su) : At 7th level, the dungeon delver

can sense an accumulation of treasure worth 1,000 gp or

more within a range of 200 feet per dungeon delver level.

He does not know the exact composition or nature of the

treasure thus located, only its direction and distance from

him (with a 10-foot margin of error). All valuables within

10 feet of a given point count as a single treasure, so two

piles of gold pieces separated by 5 feet would register as

one treasure, not two. Treasure sense always locates the

treasure with the greatest market value if more than one

accumulation is within range. This ability does not grant

any  knowledge  about  the  safest  path  (if  any )  between

the dungeon delver and the treasure; it merely provides

direction and distance.

Find  the  Path  (Sp):  Three  times  per  day,  a  dungeon

delver of 9th level or higher can  nd his way into and out

of the most confounding mazes and dungeons. This abil-

ity functions like a  nd the  path spell cast by a 16th-level

sorcerer, except that it affects the user only.

Phase  Door  (Sp):  At  10th  level,  the  dungeon  delver

gains the ability to create a phase door once per day. This

enables him to bypass cave-ins, walk through dead ends

and immovable obstructions (such as a portcullis welded

into place), and make quick escapes through walls. This

ability functions exactly like a phase door spell cast by

an  15th-level  sorcerer,  except  that  the  dungeon  delver

can  create  an  ethereal  passage  through  any  nonliving

substance, not just wood, plaster, and stone.

FANG OF LOLTH

Many bards and rogues study ways to trick magic items

into working without their usual requirements. Sometimes,

though, the curious get more than they bargained for.

Worshipers of Lolth occasionally create a magic item

called  a  fang  scarab  that  gives  spiders  an  attack  bonus.

Such an item is ordinary enoughuntil a bard or rogue

makes  a  successful  Use  Magic  Device  check  to  trick  it

into working for her. Though she does gain the bene t

of the fang scarab, it also fuses to her neck, beginning a

metamorphosis that could eventually turn her into a half-

spider abomination.

Some   ght  this  transformation,  continuing  their

adventuring careers normally with only a few outward

manifestations  of  spiderlike  qualities.  Others  embrace

the metamorphosis and earn levels in the fang of Lolth

prestige class, giving over their bodies to the image of the

Demon Queen of Spiders. Regardless of their attitudes

toward this new legacy, those who have fused with fang

scarabs eventually learn that death is the only way to sepa-

rate the items from their bodies.

Clerics and other agents of Lolth know about this aspect

of  fang  scarabs,  so  they  spare  no  effort  to  bring  anyone

who has fused with one into Lolths service. Most NPC

fangs of Lolth work for clerics of the Spider Queen, but a

few renegades exist who want the power of the spider but

arent willing to bow to Lolth. Agents of the Spider Queen

constantly hound such characters, intent on either bring-

ing them into Lolths service or killing them to recover the

fang scarabs.

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Because  fangs  of  Lolth  begin  their  careers

by  unlocking  the  secrets  of  the  fang  scarab,

they must be able to trick the item into treating

them as spiders. That limitation leaves this class

open only to characters with ranks in the  U s e

Magic Device skill. Even the most power-

ful wizards and sorcerers try in vain to get

fang  scarabs  to  work  in  this  manner;  it

takes the intuitive guesswork (and luck)

of one who knows how to trick magic items.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

Requirements

To qualify as a fang of Lolth, a character must

ful ll  all  the  following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Use Magic Device 10 ranks.

Special:  The  character  must  acquire  a

scarab and get it to function with a successful

Use Magic Device check (DC 25). This grants

her  the  bene ts  of  the  item  (see  sidebar)  and

fuses it permanently to her neck.

Fangs  of  Lolth  gain  no

Skill Bonuses: As an

extraordinary

ability,

the fang of Lolth gains a

+2 competence bonus on

Climb and Jump checks.

In  addition,  the  whis-

about  how  magic  works,  giving  her  a  +4  insight

bonus on Use Magic Device checks. This bonus is a

supernatural ability.

Sneak  Attack:  The  fang  of  Lolth  gains  the  sneak

attack  ability  (see  the  Rogue  section  in  Chapter  3

o f  the Players  Handbook)  at  2nd  level  if  she  does  not

already have it. She gains +1d6 damage with this attack

initially, but this rises to +2d6 at 5th level and to +3d6

at 8th level. If she already has the sneak attack ability

from a previous class, the damage bonuses stack.

Spider Bite: The fang of Lolth can unhinge her jaw

and bite with her razor-sharp teeth as an attack action.

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Her  bite  is  a  natural  attack  that  deals  ld6

points  of  damage  if  she  is  Medium-size,

or  1d4  points  of  damage  if  she  is  Small.

This  attack  does  not  provoke  an  attack  of

opportunity from the fang of Lolths foe. If

she  uses  a  full  attack  action,  she  can  make

normal  weapon  attacks  and  use  her  bite  as

a  secondary  natural  attack  at  the  standard

5 penalty.

Climb  Speed  20  Feet  (Ex)  :  At  4th

level, the fang of Lolth can climb walls and

ceilings  at  a  speed  of  20  feet,  just  like  the

monstrous  spider  shes  slowly  becoming.

This ability grants her a +8 racial bonus on

Climb checks.

Natural  Armor:  At  6th  level,  the  char-

acters  skin  toughens,  granting  her  a  +2

natural armor bonus. At 10th level, her skin

hardens  into  a  chitinous  carapace,  increas-

ing her natural armor bonus to +4.

Spider  Vision  (Ex)  :  At  6th  level,  the

fang  of  Lolth  gains  increased  visual  acuity

in  the  form  of  a  +4  competence  bonus  on

both Spot and Search checks. She also gains

darkvision  with  a  range  of  60  feet.  If  she

already  has  darkvision  as  a  class  feature  or

racial ability, the ranges do not stack.

Summon  Swarm  (Sp):  Three  times  a

day,  a  fang  of  Lolth  of  7th  level  or  higher

can summon and direct an army of normal

spiders to do her bidding. This ability works

exactly  like  a  summon  swarm  spell  cast  by

a  druid  of  a  level  equal  to  the  characters

fang  of  Lolth  level,  except  that  the  swarm

is  always  composed  of  spiders.  The  fang  of

Lolth can spend a move-equivalent action to

direct the swarm, which moves at a speed of

30 feet.

Fang Scarab

fang-shaped

A

crystal

dangles from a loop of  nely

wrought  silver  chain  in  the

center  of  this  spiderweb

medallion.  When  the  chain

is  used  to  wrap  the  fang

scarab  around  the  juncture

of  a  monstrous  spiders

cephalothorax  (head)  and

abdomen,  the  creature  can

hear  Lolths  dark  whis-

pers  in  its  subconscious.

This  gives  it  an  instinctive

knowledge of what the next

moment  will  bring,  which

manifests  as  a  +1  insight

bonus on attack rolls.

Because the fang scarab is

designed for spiders, its not

useful to most adventurers.

A  nonspider  can  make  a

fang  scarab  function  with

a  successful  Use  Magic

Device  check  (DC  25),  but

this  also  fuses  it  perma-

nently  to  its  users  neck,

near  the  throat.  Nothing

short  of  the  wearers  death

can then remove it.

Though  the  fang  scarab

grants  its  wearer  the  same

attack  bonus  that  it  would

to  a  spider,  it  also  initiates

a  terrible  metamorphosis

that changes the wearer into

a  half-spider  abomination

over time. When the scarab

 rst attaches itself, the wear-

ers  canine  teeth  enlarge,

and

coarse  black  hair

appears  on  the  back  of  her

neck.  No  further  changes

occur until she attains levels

in the fang of Lolth prestige

class (see Physical Changes,

at right).

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequi-

sites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

divination; Market  Price:

3,500 gp; Weight:.

Spider  Limbs  (Ex)  :  At  9th  level,  the

fang of Lolth actually grows two more pairs

of limbs, which emerge from her back or the

sides of her torso when needed and are fully

retractable.  Extending  or  retracting  the

spider limbs is a move-equivalent action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The

fang  of  Lolths  spider  legs  are  tipped  with

simple  claws  that  can  hold  weapons  and

other items normally, though they are inca-

pable of the  ne manipulation required for

spellcasting or using Dexterity-based skills

such as Open Lock and Pick Pocket. Despite her extra

limbs, the fang of Lolth is still limited to one standard

action per round. She can, however, make a secondary

natural attack with each clawed spider leg at the stand-

ard -5 penalty as part of a full attack action. Her claws

deal ld4 points of damage if she is Medium-size or 1d3

10

points of damage if she is Small. The fang of Lolth can

acquire  the  Multiattack,  Multidexterity,  and  Multi-

weapon  Fighting  feats  if  she  wishes  to  use  her  claws

more  effectively  or  wield  weapons  in  multiple  limbs.

At 10th level, the fang of Lolths spider limbs grow long

and sturdy enough to propel her forward, if she devotes

two of her spider legs entirely to locomotion, her land

and climb speeds each increase by 20 feet.

Vermin Type (Ex) : At 10th level, the fang of Lolths

creature type changes to vermin, though she retains her

previous Intelligence score, Hit Die type, and abilities.

As a vermin, she becomes immune to mind-in uenc-

ing effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,

and morale effects).

Physical  Changes:  With  each  fang  of  Lolth  level

she attains, the characters body undergoes a metamor-

phosis.  With  the  exception  of  the  unhinged  jaw  and

the  extra  spider  limbs  (both  of  which  allow  special

attacks as detailed above), all these changes are merely

cosmetic, but they are permanent. These spiderlike fea-

tures do not alter the fang of Lolths Charisma score or

interpersonal skills, but the DM may choose to impose

a circumstance penalty on any checks involving inter-

action  with  creatures  that   nd  such  changes  fright-

ening.  A  clever  fang  of  Lolth  may  avoid  this  issue  by

wearing a hat of disguise or employing some other magic

that alters her appearance.

OUTLAW OF THE

CRIMSON ROAD

Its often said that you dont choose the crimson road; it

chooses you. The crimson road is how folklore often

refers to the outlaws life because it is bloody and dan-

gerous. But while you may come to outlawry through

no  fault  of  your  own,  mos t  outlaws  unquestionably

bring that fate upon themselves.

The  outlaw  of  the  crimson  road  is  totally  cut  off

from normal society. Anyone is free to kill him without

legal reprisal, for a writ of outlawry has already revoked

his rights to trial and due process. Whether or not hes

truly  guilty  of  the  crimes  attributed  to  him,  theres  a

reward for putting his head on a pike or hanging him at

a crossroads.

An outlaw of the crimson road might be a failed rev-

olutionary, a loyal supporter of some deposed ruler, or

merely an ordinary individual who angered the wrong

person  at  the  wrong  time.  With  a  sentence  of  death

hanging over his head, he has taken to living outside

societys laws, robbing all who pass except those under

his special protection (see The Outlaws Code sidebar).

Characters of many classes may  nd themselves out-

laws,  but  some  take  to  it  better  than  others.  Rogues

excel  at  stealth  and  rangers  at  woodcraft-both  handy

skills for planning ambushes. Bards, on the other hand,

rely  primarily  on  their  reputations  and  the  legends

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

about  their  exploits  to  make  travelers  part  peaceably

with  their  goods.  A  lone  monk  drummed  out  of  his

order  could  be  a  highly  effective  outlaw,  as  could  a

paladin  who  has  fallen  afoul  of  a  corrupt  administra-

tion and taken to the woods as a  nal, desperate way of

righting wrongs. Barbarians usually lack the subtlety

to make a living this way.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Features

Class Features

All the following are class features of the outlaw of the

crimson road prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: An outlaw of the

crimson  road  is  pro cient  with  simple  weapons,  one

martial weapon of choice, and one exotic weapon (the

net), as well as with light armor.

Ambush: During a surprise round, the outlaw can

make an attack against any target who hasnt yet acted,

If  successful,  such  an  attack  by  a  1st-level  outlaw  of

the  crimson  road  deals  +ld6  points  of  extra  damage.

This  amount  increases  by  +ld6  points  for  every  two

additional  outlaw  levels  the  attacker  has.  Creatures

immune to sneak attacks (such as undead, constructs,

oozes,  and  plants)  are  likewise  not  vulnerable  to  this

special  damage.  A  ranged  attack  delivers  the  extra

damage only if the target is within 30 feet. If the char-

acter already has the sneak attack ability from a previ-

ous class, the extra damage for an ambush stacks with

his sneak attack damage, but only if conditions are also

right for a sneak attack.

Life on the Crimson Road: The outlaw has learned

much from his time on the wrong side of the law. At

for these choices.

The Outlaws Code

Each  outlaw  of  the  crim-

son  road  must  choose  a

group (subject to the DMs

approval) that is immune to

his depredations. For exam-

ple,  the  Pirates  of  Penzance

refused to rob orphans, while

Robin Hood spared the poor.

Some outlaws refuse to steal

from  members  of  the  oppo-

site sex, of their own race, or

of  the  clergy.  In  return,  the

group granted this immunity

idolizes  the  outlaw  and  aids

him in times of distress. For

example,  members  of  the

chosen group might provide

a hiding place or send pursu-

ers  in  the  wrong  direction.

An  outlaw  who  knowingly

harms  a  member  of  his

chosen  group  must  atone

for  his  misdeeds  (see  the

the

atonement  spell

Players  Handbook).  Until

he  has  completed  his  pen-

ance,  he

loses  all  class

features  from  the  prestige

class except for weapon and

armor pro ciencies.

in

Evasion:  At  3rd  level,  the  outlaw  gains

the evasion ability (see the Rogue section in

Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook) if he does

not already have it.

Fugitives  Luck:  At  4th  level,  the  outlaw

of  the  crimson  road  gains  a  +1  luck  bonus

on all saving throws and a +2 luck bonus on

Escape Artist checks. These bonuses increase

to +2 and +4 at 6th level, and to +3 and +6 at

9th level.

Leadership: Also at 4th level, the outlaw

gains Leadership as a bonus feat and begins

to  attract  a  band  of  like-minded  cohorts

and  followers.  These  may  range  from

people  he  spared  in  an  earlier  encounter

(see  The  Outlaws  Code  sidebar)  to  would-

be lieutenants drawn by his growing repu-

tation among the homeless commoners he

protects.  Some  of  these  cohorts  and  fol-

lowers  may  join  the  outlaw  in  his  hideout

and operate openly at his side, while others

might help by providing safe houses, alibis,

supplies, and possibly even cover identities

when  needed.  After  all,  an  outlaw  who

enters  a  town  where  theres  a  price  on  his

head has a better chance of maintaining his

cover  if  he  has  a  good  disguise  and  some

innocent-looking companions.

Improved  Evasion:  At  6th  level,  the  outlaw  gains

the  improved  evasion  ability  (see  the  Rogue  section

in  Chapter  3  of  the  Players  Handbook)  if  he  does  not

already have it.

Ranged  Disarm:  At  7th  level,  the  outlaw  can  use

ranged  attacks  to  disarm  opponents  within  30  feet.

Cheat death

Doing  so  doesnt  provoke  an  attack  of  opportunity

from the defender unless a normal ranged attack would

(if the outlaw and the target are adjacent, for instance).

Regardless of the ranged weapon the outlaw is using, it

counts  as  a  one-handed,  Medium-size  weapon  for  the

opposed disarm check. The outlaw cannot lose his own

weapon during such an attempt.

Legend: At 8th level, the characters reputation gains

him  a  +4  circumstance  bonus  on  Bluff,  Diplomacy,

Gather Information, and Intimidate checks. This bonus

applies only when he is interacting openly with others

who know his reputation, not when be is in disguise or

otherwise unknown to those with whom he is dealing.

Furthermore, the outlaws status as a legend counts as

great  prestige  for  purposes  of  acquiring  cohorts  and

followers with the leadership feat.

Cheat Death (Ex) : At 10th level, an outlaw of the

crimson  road  gains  the  extraordinary  ability  to  avoid

a  fatal  blow.  This  re ects  the  dif culty  inherent  in

bringing the career of any truly remarkable highway-

man to its  nal close. The cheat death ability functions

exactly  like  the  rogues  defensive  roll  (see  the  Rogue

section  in  Chapter  3  of  the  Players  Handbook),  except

that any source of damage (including spells and traps)

can be avoided, and the outlaw need not be aware of the

attack beforehand. Once per day, he can make a Re ex

save (DC = damage dealt) to take half damage from an

attack,  spell,  or  effect  tha t  would  otherwise  reduce

him  to  0  or  fewer  hit  points.  If  the  effect  directed  at

him allows a Re ex save for half damage, the outlaws

improved evasion ability comes into play as it normally

would, but improved evasion does not otherwise help

him cheat death.

Of course, an unscrupulous outlaw who knows that

someone  is  about  to  storm  his  hideout  might  use  his

Disguise  skill  to  switch  clothes  with  a   unky.  Then

all  he  has  to  do  is  feign  death  from  some  relatively

minor injury (one that dealt enough damage to kill the

 unky) and make a quiet exit as soon as his killers are

occupied  elsewhere.  Ruses  such  as  this  often  help  to

extend an outlaws career.

ROYAL EXPLORER

Keoland  monarchs  enjoy  learning  of  other  lands  and

cultures, but pressing matters of state often keep them

tied to their throne rooms. So for years, they have spon-

sored  crack  teams  of  explorers  who  travel  the  length

and breadth of the world, then return to deliver reports

on faraway wonders. Accordingly, the royal library of

Keoland  has  the  best  selection  of  maps  in  the  world,

as well as a fascinating series of journals known as the

Minutes of the Royal Explorers Society.

Because the Minutes are often used in geography les-

sons, many a nobles child lies awake at night, dream-

ing  of  climbing  mountains  along  with  Ahn  Balic  or

hunting  albino  dire  wolves  with  Istai  Sunblessed.

However,  the  entrance  examinations  for  the  Royal

Explorers Society are rigorous indeed. To be accepted,

an  applicant  mus t  not  onl y  demonstrate  a  thorough

knowledge  of  geography  and  possess  impeccable  car-

tographic  skills,  but  also  impress  the  societys  admis-

sions committee with veri able tales of a particularly

noteworthy exploration.

Academic  geographers  tend  not  to  survive  explora-

tions  in  the  wild,  so  most  royal  explorers  are  former

bards or rogues. Adventurers in the midst of their own

explorations  sometimes  encounter  NPC  royal  explor-

ers, who may either seek advice or offer it. In addition,

many of them hire bands of adventurers to deal with

the  more  dangerous  denizens  of  the  areas  theyre

exploring. Royal explorers also pay top coin for copies

of any maps adventurers may have made of previously

unexplored regions.

determining this modi er.

Explorer  Check:  The  royal  explorer  makes  a  Knowl-

edge (geography) check (DC 15) once per month or when-

ever he travels to a new culture. Success means he can use

his knowledge of the culture he is visiting to his advantage,

gaining a +4 circumstance bonus on certain skill checks. At

2nd level, this bonus applies only to Diplomacy checks. For

every  two  royal  explorer  levels  thereafter,  the  bonus  also

applies to one additional skill, as shown on Table 15. He

retains these circumstance bonuses until his next Knowl-

edge (geography) check. For particularly isolated or far-off

cultures, the DM can raise the DC of the Knowledge (geog-

raphy) check to 20 or higher.

Track: At 2nd level, the royal explorer gains Track as

a bonus feat.

Brave: A royal explorer of 3rd level or higher gains a

+4 morale bonus on Will saves against fear effects.

Search Bonus: At 5th level, a royal explorer gains

a +2 competence bonus on Search and Wilderness lore

checks made to  nd a path, including checks for secret

doors and for following tracks.

Never Lost: A royal explorer of 6th level or higher

automatically  succeeds  at  Wilderness  lore  and  Intuit

Direction  checks  made  to  avoid  being  lost,  and  maze

spells dont affect him.

Skill Mastery: At 7th level and higher, a royal explorer

can use his skills reliably even under adverse conditions.

When he  rst quali es for this ability, select a number of

skills equal to 3 + his Intelligence modi er for mastery.

When making a check with one of these skills, the char-

acter  may  take  10  even  if  stress  and  distractions  would

normally prevent him from doing so.

public scrutiny. To allay suspicions, she often maintains

a cover identity by pretending to be a member of some

other  character  class-typically  the  one  in  which  she

began her career.

Spymasters are rarely popular, but as long as nation

distrusts nation, there will be work for those who can

gather information that others wish to keep hidden.

Many a ruler who publicly claims to abhor spymasters

secretly employs a stable of them, if only to protect his

own secrets from the spymasters of other nations. The

secrecy inherent in the profession and its high fatal-

ity  rate  make  it  impossible  to  determine  how  many

spymasters are active in a setting at any given time.

Rogues  make  excellent  spymasters  because  of  their

generous  skill  allotments  and  their  propensity  for

stealth. Likewise, rangers have an edge when operating as

spymasters in outdoor surroundings. In truth, however,

characters  of  any  class  may  become  spymastersthe

more unlikely the combination may seem, the better the

cover it provides. Some wizards and sorcerers use their

spellcraft as a cover for subterfuge, and some barbarians

are far more subtle than they may seem. Spymasters may

also be of any alignment. They range from self-serving

information brokers who sell their services to the high-

est  bidder  to  high-minded  moles  who  penetrate  and

destroy corrupt organizations.

Its important for spymasters to keep personal emotions

distinct  from  professional  attachments.  They  must  be

ready  to  liquidate  eve n  someone  close  to  them  without

a moments thought if so ordered. Betrayal is their busi-

ness, and their loyalty is always to their mission, not to the

people encountered while carrying that mission out.

Occasionally, spymasters  nd it expedient to in ltrate

adventuring parties heading for the area where the real

mission lies.

Innuendo 5 ranks.

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

cover identity also leads opponents to underestimate the

spymaster until it is too late. At 1st level, a spymaster estab-

lishes one speci c cover identity (such as Murek the tailor

from  Sumberton).  While  operating  in  that  identity,  she

gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a

+2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Gather Information

checks. At 4th level and again at 7th level, the spymaster

can maintain one additional cover identity that provides

the same circumstance bonuses as the  rst.

Should  the  spymaster  wish  to  retire  a  cover  iden-

tity and develop a new one, she must spend one week

rigorously  practicing  subtle  vocal  intonations  and

body  language  before  she  earns  the  bonuses.  Cover

identities do not in themselves provide the spymaster

with  additional  skills,  pro ciencies,  or  class  features

that others might expect of the professions pretended,

though  required  ranks  (see

below)  can  bolster

skills  in  the  chosen

areas.  However,  the

spymaster must be

careful  to  choose

identities  that  can

withstand

regular

scrutiny.

Required Ranks:

A  spymaster  makes

it a point to know what

shes  doing  while  shes

pretending to be someone

else. At every spymaster level,

she must spend at least two skill

points on a Craft, Profession, or

Knowledge skill relating to one

other  chosen  cover  identities.

The  usual  maximum  rank

limit still applies to these

skills.

Sneak  Attack:  The

spymaster  gains  the

sneak attack ability (see

the  Rogue  section  in

two skills from the following list: Diplomacy, Disguise,

Forgery, and Sense Motive.

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook) at 1st level if she does

not  already  have  it.  She  gains  +1d6  damage  with  this

attack initially, but this rises to +2d6 at 4th level and to

+3d6 at 7th level, if she already has the sneak attack abil-

ity from a previous class, the damage bonuses stack.

Undetectable  Alignment  (Ex):  The  web  of  differ-

ent identities and agendas inside the spymasters mind

makes it impossible to detect her alignment via any form

of  divination  once  she  reaches  2nd  level.  This  ability

functions  exactly  like  an  undetectable  alignment  spell,

except that it is always active. Only divinations are con-

founded; spells that function only against certain align-

ments, such as protection from evil and holy smite, affect the

spymaster normally.

Quick  Change  (Ex):  By  3rd  level,  the  spymaster  has

become  adept  at  quickly  switching  from  one  identity

to another. She now can don a disguise in one-tenth the

normal time (1d3 minutes) and put on or take off armor in

one-half the normal time.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Also  at  3rd  level,  the  spy-

master gains the uncanny dodge ability (see the Rogue

section in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook) if she did

not  already  have  it.  She  gains  additional  bene ts  of

this ability as her spymaster level increases (see Table

16).  If  she  already  had  uncanny  dodge  from  one  or

more  previous  classes,  levels  of  those  classes  stack

with spymaster levels for the purpose of determining

the bene ts, but she continues to progress in the abil-

ity along whichever track she was originally using for

it.  For  example,  if  a  rogue  becomes  a  spymaster,  add

together her levels of spymaster and rogue, then refer

to  Table  315;  The  Rogue  in  the  Players  Handbook  to

determine the bene ts of uncanny dodge at her new,

combined level.

Slippery  Mind  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  the  spymaster

gains the slippery mind ability (see the Rogue section

in  Chapter  3  of  the  Players  Handbook)  if  she  does  not

already have it.

Spot Scrying (Ex): Also at 5th level, the spymaster

notices the magical sensor created by arcane eye, scrying,

a crystal ball, or the like with a successful Spot check

(DC 20).

Deep  Cover  (Ex):  At  8th  level,  the  spymaster  can

quiet  her  min d  and  completely  immerse  herself  in  her

cover identity at will. While she is in deep cover, divina-

tion  spells  detect  only  information  appropriate  for  her

cover  identity;  they  reveal  nothing  relating  to  her  spy-

master persona.

Hear Subharmonics: Also at 8th level, the spymaster

can  determine  the  true  motives  of  others  by  listening

carefully to the subtle in ections of their voices. Her ears

are so well trained that she gains a +3 insight bonus on

Sense Motive checks.

Detection Damper (Su): At 9th level, the spymaster

can  subconsciously  create  interference  that  hampers

detect magic spells. The aura strengths for all magic items

she  holds,  carries,  or  wears  register  as  two  categories

16

weaker than they normally would. For example, a strong

aura becomes faint, and faint or dim auras become com-

pletely undetectable.

Reactive Body Language (Ex): Also at 9th level, the

spymaster  learns  the  silent  language  of  subconscious

body movements. By mimicking the body language of

those with whom she interacts, she gains a +2 insight

bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.

Mind  Blank  (Sp):  At  10t h  level,  the  spymaster  can

become immune to all mind-affecting spells and divina-

tions by rigorously silencing her mind. Using mind blank

is a standard action, and the spyrnaster can do it a number

of  times  per  day  equal  to  3  +  her  Intelligence  modi er.

This ability works exactly like a mind blank spell cast by

a 15th-level sorcerer, except that it affects the spymaster

only and its duration is 10 minutes.

TEMPLE RAIDER

OF OLIDAMMARA

Olidammaras worshipers dont have many temples of

their own, but some of them spend a great deal of time

in the temples of other deities-robbing them of every

valuable  thats  even  remotely  portable.  The  temple

raiders  are  an  elite  cadre  of  thieves  who  worship  the

Laughing  Rogue  and  specialize  in  stealing  valuables

and secret lore from the temples of other deities. Few

enterprises are as dangerous as breaking into a temple,

so Olidammara grants limited spellcasting abilities to

temple raiders in his service.

Temple  raiders  usually  work  in  small  teams,  using

stealth,  disguise,  or  magic  to  in ltrate  a  rival  temple

secretly. Once inside, they plunder the treasury, steal reli-

gious relics, and abscond with any secrets the clerics of

the rival temple cared to write down. If all goes well, they

slip  out  unnoticed,  but  theyre  not  above   ghting  their

way to freedom. They know that the penalty for stealing

from a temple is usually death, so theyre quick to draw

blades when capture seems imminent.

Temple raiders are always listening for news of great

riches  or  dark  secrets  at  the  temples  of  other  deities,

and they eagerly chase down rumors of hidden shrines

and  half-buried  temples  from  bygone  ages.  However,

they  typically  have  plenty  of  time  between  raids  for

normal adventuring, which they undertake frequently

with  their  deitys  blessing.  After  all,  dungeon  adven-

turing hones the skills that the temple raider needs for

special missions-such as liberating the war-booty that

the  clerics  of  St.  Cuthberts  temple  are  now  bringing

home for safekeeping.

Clerics  who  venerate  other  deities  consider  temple

raiders a menace, so most of the latter pose as rogues,

bards, or even clerics of Olidammara instead. Rogues

and  bards  usually  have  the  skills  a  temple  raider

needs, whereas only a few rare clericseven those of

Olidammaracan pick a lock or sabotage a trap well

enough  to  meet  the  temple  raiders  standards.  Player

characters  may  encounter

NPC temple raiders  eeing

from town with their latest

victims on their heels, or in

the midst of planning a raid.

Spells:  A  temple  raider  can  cast,  a  small

number  of  divine  spells.  His  spells  are  based  on

Wisdom,  so  casting  any  given  spell  requires  a

cates that the temple raider is entitled to 0 spells a

given  level  (such  as  0 1st-level  spells  at  1st  level),

he gets only those bonus spells that his Wisdom

score allows.

THIEF-ACROBAT

Like any large guild, a thieves guild has many specialists

within its rankspickpockets, burglars, swindlers, and

even highway robbers. None of these, however, have the

prestige of a thief-acrobatthe superlative second-story

burglar who is infamous for daring escapades across the

citys rooftops.

The  thief-acrobat  excels  at  getting  into  and  out  of

places  no  one  else  can.  If  every  street-level  entrance  to

the  Jewelers  Guildhouse  is  locked  and  well  guarded,

the  thief-acrobat  simply  jumps  atop  the  building  from

the roof of a nearby inn, throws a grappling hook to the

highest minaret, runs up the attached rope to a shuttered

window, and quickly picks the lock. Should her escape go

awry once she has the goods, her gymnastic combat style

keeps her out of harms way.

Most  thief-acrobats  began  as  rogues  and  worked

their  way  up  through  the  guilds  ranks.  Members  of

other  classesparticularly  the  barbarian  and  illusion-

istoften  nd the  acrobatics and climbing skills of the

thief-acrobat prestige class quite attractive as well.

Adventuring  parties  often  encounter  an  NPC

thief-acrobat in the midst of some crime. Sometimes,

however, a thief-acrobat hires adventurers to help with

particularly dangerous capers, or even to create diver-

sions while she works.

To  become  a  thief-acrobat,  a  character  must  ful ll  all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

sway (Chaos, Luck, and Trickery). He thus has access to

two domain spells at each spell level and may prepare

one or the other each day in his domain spell slot.

A  temple  raider  must  spend  1  hour  each  night  in

quiet  contemplation  and  supplication  to  Olidammara

to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent rest-

ing has no effect on whether he can prepare spells.

Unlike clerics, temple raiders do not channel energy

to turn or rebuke undead, nor can they spontaneously

cast  cure  or in ict  spells.  They  also  gain  no  granted

powers for their domains.

Sneak  Attack:  The  temple  raider  gains  the  sneak

attack ability (see the Rogue section in Chapter 3 of the

Players Handbook) at 2nd level if he does not already have

it. He gains +1d6 damage with this attack initially, and

this rises by +1d6 per three temple raider levels there-

after. If he already has the sneak attack ability from a

previous class, the damage bonuses stack.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  the  temple

raider gains the uncanny dodge ability (see the Rogue

section  in  Chapter  3  of  the  Players  Handbook)  if  he

did  not  already  have  it.  He  gains  additional  bene ts

of this ability as his temple raider level increases (see

Table 17). If he already had uncanny dodge from one

or  more  previous  classes,  levels  of  those  classes  stack

with temple raider levels for the purpose of determin-

ing  the  bene ts,   but  he  continues  to  progress  in  the

ability along whichever track he was originally using

for it. For example, if a rogue becomes a temple raider,

add together his levels of temple raider and rogue, then

refer to Table 315: The Rogue in the Players Handbook

to determine the bene ts of uncanny dodge at his new,

combined level.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Thief-acrobats are

pro cient with all simple weapons. With the exception of

sneak attacks, the thief-acrobat cannot use any other class

features while wearing armor bulkier than light.

Kip Up (Ex) : A thief-acrobat can stand up from a prone

position as a free action.

Unbounded leap (Ex) : A thief-acrobats height does

not limit her jumping distance (horizontal or vertical).

Fast  Balance  (Ex)  :  At  2nd  level,  the  thief-acrobat

gains the ability to balance easily on a precarious surface.

A successful Balance check (for DCs, see the Balance skill

description in Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook) allows

her to move her speed rather than half her speed under

such conditions.

Improved Trip: At 2nd level, the thief-acrobat gains

Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if she does not have

the Expertise feat prerequisite.

Improved Evasion (Ex) : At 3rd level, the thief-acrobat

gains improved evasion (see the Rogue section in Chapter

3 of the Players Handbook) if she does not already have it.

Slow fall (Ex) : At 3rd level, the thief-acrobat also gains

the slow fall ability (see the Monk section in Chapter 3 of

the Players Handbook). Initially, she takes falling damage

as though each fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.

The falling distance that she can ignore increases by 10

feet for every three thief-acrobat levels she gains. If the

character already has the slow fall ability from a previous

class, the distances do not stack.

Defensive Fighting Bonus: The fact that the thief-

acrobat is perpetually whirling and spinning makes her

a dif cult target to hit. When  ghting defensively, she

gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC rather than the normal

+2  bonus  or  the  +3  bonus  for  having  5  or  more  ranks

in Tumble. When executing the total defense standard

action,  she  gains  a  +8  dodge  bonus  to  AC  rather  than

the usual +4 bonus or the +6 bonus for having 5 or more

ranks in Tumble.

ancing  on  a  precarious  surface  or  climbing.  In  either

case, she moves her speed with each move-equivalent

action and can even run if desired, as long as she does

so in a straight line. Furthermore, she can take 10 on

all Climb and Balance checks unless shes engaged in

melee combat.

Fight Anywhere (Ex): By 10th level, the thief-acro-

bat can  ght normally even while climbing or balanc-

ing  on  something.  This  means,  for  example,  tha t  a

thief-acrobat could climb a few steps up a nearby wall to

earn the attack bonus for higher ground while engaged

in melee. She must, however, keep at least one hand free

to climb.

See Complete Adventurer

VIGILANTE

One  vigilante  may  have  suffered  personally  at  the

hands  of  criminals  and  be  bent  on  revenge.  Another

might have lost loved ones to knives in a dark alleyway.

Still another could be atoning for the time he himself

spent on the wrong side of the law. Whatever the cause,

a  vigilante  has  burn-

to

solve  crimes

and  bring

cr iminals

to justice.

Sneak  Attack:  The  thief-acrobat  gains  the  sneak

attack  ability  (see  the  Rogue  section  in  Chapter  3  of

the Players Handbook) at 4th level if she does not already

have it. She gains +1d6 damage with this attack initially,

but this rises to +2d6 at 9th level. If she already has the

sneak attack ability from a previous class, the damage

bonuses stack.

Cartwheel Charge: By somersaulting and cartwheel-

ing in a straight line toward a foe 10 feet or more away,

the thief-acrobat of at least 5th level can make an unusual

charge  attack,  gaining  the  standard  +2  bonus  on  attack

rolls and -2 penalty to AC for a charge. Executing the cart-

wheel charge requires a Tumble check (DC 20). Success

means that the thief-acrobat deals sneak attack damage to

her target on a successful hit; failure means she achieves

the  normal  results  of  a  charge  but  does  not  get  sneak

attack damage.

Fast  Climb  (Ex)  :  By  5th  level,  the  thief-acrobat  is

an expert at climbing. A successful Climb check allows

her to move her full speed rather than half her speed in

any situation that would

normally require such a

check. Fast climb counts

as a miscellaneous full-

round action.

Prone  Defense:  By

6th level, the thief-acro-

bat  is  accustomed  to

rolling and spinning on

the  ground.  Opponents

who  attack  her  while

shes prone dont get the +4

attack bonus that they ordi-

narily would receive.

Defensive  Roll:

The  vigilante  combines  magical  and  mundane

investigative  techniques  to  assess  a  crime  scene.  Hes

adept  at   nding  out  the  word  on  the  street  about  a

crime, analyzing clues, and identifying likely suspects.

Once hes on the trail, he relentlessly tails, apprehends,

and  interrogates  a  suspect  until  the  truth  comes  out.

One vigilante could work for the local ruler or the city

guard, but another might be an independent detective-

for-hire. A third might even take to the streets by night

to  stop  crimes  in  progressor  keep  would-be  crimi-

nals from striking in the  rst place.

A bard or rogue can pick up the variety of skills a

vigilante needs very quickly. Rangers also tend to  nd

the  class  appealing,  for  it  allows  them  to  engage  in

urban hunts with criminals as their prey.

An  NPC  vigilante  might  turn  up  just  in  time  to

save  the  player  characters  from  becoming  crime  vic-

tims themselves. However, if they break the law on a

vigilantes home turf, the heroes may  nd themselves

under his unwelcome scrutiny.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

The vigilantes class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Wis), Dis-

able Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex),

Hide  (Dex),  Innuendo  (Wis),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Jump

(Str), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform

Class Features

Class Features

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  vigilante

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Vigilantes  are

pro cient  with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,  plus

the net. They gain no new armor pro ciencies.

Spells:  Beginning  at  1st  level,  a  vigilante  can  cast

arcane spells just as a sorcerer does. To cast a particular

spell,  the  vigilante  must  have  a  Charisma  score  of  at

least  10  +  the  spells  level.  The  character  gains  bonus

spells based on his Charisma score, and the DC for the

saving throws against his spells is 10+ the spells level

+ the vigilantes Charisma modi er. Like a sorcerer, a

vigilante need not prepare his spells ahead of time.

Detect Evil (Sp): Once per day per vigilante level, the

character can detect evil just as a paladin does (see the

Paladin section in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook).

Search for Clues: A vigilante of 2nd level or higher

who  merely  passes  within  5  feet  of  a  clue  to  a  crime

is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if he were

actively looking for it. The vigilante must be aware that

a crime has occurred, but need not know the speci cs.

The clue cannot be more than a week old.

Streetwise: Select  one  city  to  be  the  vigilantes

home turf. While in that city, he gains a circumstance

bonus  on  Innuendo  and  Gather  Information  checks.

This bonus is initially +2 at 2nd level, but it increases

with  class  level  as  given  on  Table  1-9.  If  he  moves  to

another city, he must spend a month getting acquainted

with the new area before he can use this ability there.

Incredible Luck: This ability, available to vigilan-

tes of 3rd level or higher, allows you to reroll any roll

you have just made after learning the result but before

it  has  taken  effect.  The  rerolled  result  must  be  kept.

Although this ability is usable more than once per day

at higher levels, a vigilante cant use it more than once

for a given check.

Shadow: At 4th level, the vigilante gains Shadow as

a bonus feat. (See Chapter 2 of this book for this feats

description.)

Punish the Guilty (Su): If

a vigilante of 5th level

higher

personally

witnesses  someone

committing

an

action that the laws

of  his  home  turf

de ne  as  a  crime,

he  can  attempt  to

punish  the  miscre-

ant.  To  do  so,  he

makes  one  normal

attack and adds his

Charisma bonus (if

any)  to  the  attack

roll,  along  with

any  other  modi-

 ers

that  would

normally  apply.  If

the attack is success-

ful, it deals 1 extra

point  of  damage

per  vigilante  level.

This  special  attack

must  occur  within

three  days  of  the

crime;  otherwise  the

bonuses  no

longer

the

apply.  Punish

guilty  is  usable  once

per  day  at  5th  level,

twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 10th

level. The vigilante can use this ability as many times as

desired against the same miscreant and in response to

the same incident, as long as all such uses occur within

the time limit. Should the vigilante mistakenly try to

punish someone who is not actually guilty of the crime

witnessed,  the  bonuses  do  not  apply,  but  the  attempt

still counts against the number allowed per day.

Slippery  Mind  (Ex):  At  9th  level,  the  vigilante

gains the slippery mind ability (see the Rogue section

in  Chapter  3  of  the  Players  Handbook)  if  he  does  not

already have it.

Vigilante Spell List

Vigilantes choose their spells from the following list.

1st  Levelcause  fear,  change  self,  detect  magic,  detect

VIRTUOSO

The  roar  of  the  crowd,  the  praise  of  spectators  after

a  great  performance,  the  showers  of  gifts  from

attractive admirerswhy would anyone trade all

that for sleeping in the woods or poking around

in  smelly  old  dungeons?  The  virtuoso  leaves

creeping  down  dark  corridors  and  match-

ing wits against deadly traps to others. Her

place is on the stage, surrounded by ador-

ing fans. Fortunately for her, every place

she goes becomes a stage, and as long

as theres anyone to impress, shes in

the spotlight.

might

call  her  a  tem-

egomaniac,  yet

everyone  feels  a

little better in her

presence.

Many virtuosos are musi-

cians;  others  are  accom-

plished dancers or actors. Still others

choose to specialize in obscure and unu-

sual forms of entertainment, such as stage

magic or juggling.

Since entertainers are often on the road, a virtuoso

can  travel  wherever  she  likes,  incorporating  as  much

adventuring into her journeys as she wishes. Because

of her talent for winning admirers, she usually remains

above  suspicion  should  anything  underhanded  occur

in a place she is visiting on tour.

Bards  are  most  often  drawn  to  this  prestige  class,

although rogues, illusionists, and multiclass combina-

tions of both can also excel in it. Bards tend to perform as

musicians or actors, illusionists as stage magicians, and

rogues as dancers, tumblers, or sleight-of-hand artists.

Characters of most other classes are either not outgoing

Requirements

To qualify as a virtuoso, a character must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Skills:  Perform  10  ranks,  Intimidate  or  Diplomacy

6 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast 0-level arcane spells (cantrips).

Class Skills

The virtuosos class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Bluff  (Cha),  Concentration

(Con),  Craft  (Wis),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Disguise  (Cha),

Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Intimi-

date (Cha), Jump (Str), Perform (Cha), Spellcraft (Int),

and Tumble (Dex). See Chapter 4 in the Players Hand-

book for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  virtuoso

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Virtuosos  gain

no new weapon or armor pro ciencies.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Since the virtuoso

often  uses  magic  to  enhance  her  performances,  it s

important  for  her  to  maintain  her  magical  studies.

Thus,  whenever  she  gains  a  ne w  virtuoso  level,  she

gains  new  spells  per  day  and  spells  known  as  if  she

had gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged

to before adding the prestige class. She does not, how-

ever,  gain  any  other  bene t  a  character  of  that  class

would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats,

new familiar abilities, and so on). This means that she

adds her new level of virtuoso to the level of some other

spellcasting  class  she  has,  than  determines  spells  per

day, caster level, and spells known (if formerly a bard

or sorcerer) accordingly. If the character had more than

one spell-casting class before becoming a virtuoso, she

must decide to which class she adds each level of vir-

tuoso for purposes of spells per day and spells known.

Bardic  Music:  At  1st  level,  the  virtuoso  gains  the

bardic music ability if she did not already have it from

a previous class. All the bardic music effects (counter-

song,  fascinate,  inspire  competence,  inspire  courage,

inspire  greatness,  and  suggestion)  become  available  to

her  immediately,  subject  to  their  usual  Perform  skill

requirements (see the Bard section in Chapter 3 of the

Players Handbook). Countersong requires either a musi-

cal or a poetic performance; all others can be produced

with any performance type. Each bardic music effect

except suggestion  requires  one  daily  use  of  either  the

virtuoso performance ability (see below) or the bardic

music ability. Suggestion does not require any uses, but

the subject must  rst be fascinated.

Virtuoso  Performance: With  an  impassioned

soliloquy or a haunting melody, the virtuoso can create

magical effects beyond even the capabilities of bardic

music.  Virtuoso  performance  can  be  used  onc e  per

virtuoso level per day. If the virtuoso has bard levels,

those stack with virtuoso levels to determine uses per

day. Many virtuoso performance effects require more

than one of the abilitys allotted daily uses. Although

many  of  the  names  refer  to  musical  performances,

the  virtuoso  isnt  actually  so  limitedfor  example,

an actor could perform a sustaining soliloquy rather

than a sustaining song.

As  with  bardic  music,  the  virtuoso  can  usually

 ght   while  using  this  ability  but  cannot  cast  spells

or  activate  magic  items  by  either  spell  completion  or

command  word.  If  the  performance  forces  any  target

to make a Will save, the only other action the virtuoso

can take in the same round is a 5-foot step.

23

A mindbending melody requires two daily uses of vir-

tuoso performance and is a spell-like, mind-affecting,

language-dependent, charm ability.

Greater  Calumny  (Su):  A  7th-level  virtuoso  with  at

least 17 ranks in Perform can whip her audience into a

frenzy of loathing. Greater calumny functions exactly

like  calumny,  except  that  the  audiences  attitude  is

shifted two categories (indifferent to hostile, for exam-

ple),  and  each  affected  audience  member  gains  a  +4

morale bonus on all opposed social interaction checks

with  the  target.  Greater  calumny  is  a  supernatural,

mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

Magical  Melody  (Su):  An  8th-level  virtuoso  with  at

least  18  ranks  in  Perform  can  empower  allied  spell-

casters, raising their effective caster levels by +1 each

for  the  purposes  of  spell  effects  and  spell  resistance

checks.  This  effect  lasts  as  long  as  the  performance

does.  Magical  melody  requires  two  daily  uses  of

virtuoso performance per minute maintained. It is a

supernatural ability.

Song of Fury (Su): A 9th-level virtuoso with at least

19 ranks in Perform can enrage her allies. This ability

functions  exactly  like  barbarian  rage  on  all  willing

allies within 20 feet, and it lasts as long as the virtuoso

continues  her  performance.  Song  of  fur y  requires

three daily uses of performance per round maintained.

It is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.

Revealing Melody (Sp): A 10th-level virtuoso with at

least 20 ranks in Perform can reveal all things as they

actually are. All those who hear the revealing melody

are affected as if by a true seeing spell cast by a 17th-

level sorcerer. The effect lasts as long as the song does.

Revealing melody requires two daily uses of virtuoso

performance per round maintained and is a spell-like,

divination ability.

CHAPTER 1: PRESTIGE CLASSES

Sustaining Song: A 1st-level virtuoso with at least 11

ranks  in  Perform  can  sustain  her  unconscious  allies,

negating their need for stabilization checks during her

performance. Because theyre not making stabilization

checks,  the  affected  allies  are  neither  stabilizing  nor

losing hit points. A sustaining song lasts for 5 minutes

or  until  the  virtuoso  stops  performing,  whichever

comes  rst. Sustaining song is a supernatural ability.

Calumny  (Su):  A  3rd-level  virtuoso  with  at  least  13

ranks in Perform has mastered the  ne art of slander

and  can  deliver  a  performance  that  makes  a  speci c

character or group (class, race, nationality, or the like)

appear in the worst light possible. Each member of the

audience  must  make  a  Will  save  with  a  DC  equal  to

the  virtuosos  Perform  check  result.  Success  negates

the calumny effect; failure shifts that individuals atti-

tude toward the target by one categorythat is, from

friendly to indifferent, from indifferent to unfriendly,

or from unfriendly to hostile (see Table 5-4: In uenc-

ing NPC Attitude in the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Furthermore, each affected creature gains a +2 morale

bonus on all opposed social interaction checks against

the  target.  Calumny  lingers  in  the  minds  of  affected

audience  members  for  24  hours  per  daily  use  of  vir-

tuoso  performance  applied  to  the  calumny  attempt.

For example, a 7th-level bard/3rd-level virtuoso could

apply  seven  daily  uses  of  virtuoso  performance  to  a

song  of  antiduergar  sentiment.  All  who  heard  it  and

failed  their  Will  saves  would  be  affected  for  a  week,

and  the  virtuoso  would  have  three  virtuoso  perform-

ance  uses  lef t  that  day.  Calumny  is  a  supernatural,

mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

Jarring  Song  (Su):  A  4th-level  virtuoso  with  at  least

14  ranks  in  Perform  can  inhibit  spellcasting.  Anyone

attempting  to  cast  a  spell  during  a  jarring  song  must

make  a  Concentration  check  (DC  15  +  the

spell  level).  Success  allows  normal  com-

pletion of the spell; failure means it is lost.

A jarring song requires three daily uses of

virtuoso performance and is a supernatural,

sonic ability.

Sharp  Note  (Sp):  A  5th-level  virtuoso  with

at least 15 ranks in Perform can sharpen the

blades of all piercing and slashing weapons

within a 10-foot radius. The affected weapons

function as if a 6th-level sorcerer had cast a keen

edge  spell  on  them,  except  that  the  effect  lasts

only  10  minutes.  Sharp  note  requires  three  daily

uses  of  virtuoso  performance  and  is  a  spell-like,

transmutation ability.

Mindbending  Melody  (Sp): A  6th-level  virtuoso

with  at  least  16  ranks  in  Perform  can  dominate

a  humanoid  that  she  has  already  fascinated.

This ability functions exactly like a dominate

person  spell  cast  by  a  9th-level  sorcerer.  The

target can make a Will save (DC 15 + the vir-

tuosos Charisma modi er)  to  negate the effect.

CHAPTER 2:

SKILLS AND

FEATS

This chapter opens with two new categories of the Craft

skillCraft (poisonmaking) and Craft (trapmaking). The

next section details new ways of using existing skills. The

 nal   section  introduces  new  feats  particularly  useful  to

rogues and bards.

A PRIMER ON POISONS

A surreptitious dose of poison can bring an enemy down

without the risk of a prolonged battle. Assassins routinely

make use of poisonous concoctions, and even some rogues

and bards are willing to accept the risks involved in using

such substances. But poisons are not always readily avail-

able; even where they are legal, their purchase often brings

unwelcome scrutiny. Thus, it behooves those who would

make frequent use of poisons to brew their own.

Re ning raw materials into effective poisons requires

both patience and care. A special subcategory of the Craft

skill, Craft (poisonmaking), provides the necessary exper-

tise.  DCs  to  create  usable  poisons  from  the  substances

listed  in  Chapter  3  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide

are  given  in  Table  2-1 ,  below.  Making  poisons  with  the

Craft (poisonmaking) skill follows the rules in the Players

Handbook for making items with the Craft skill, with the

following exceptions.

1.  The  cost  of  raw  materials  varies  widely  depending

on whether the character has access to the active ingredi-

ent that is, the venom or plant that actually provides the

poison.  If  a  supply  is  readily  available,  the  raw  materials

cost one-sixth of the market price, not one-third. Other-

wise, the raw materials cost at least three-quarters of the

market price assuming that the substance in question

is for sale at all

2. To  gure out how much poison youre able to create

in a week, make a Craft (poisonmaking) check at the end

of the week. If the check is successful, multiply the check

result by the DC for the check. That result is how many gp

worth of poison you created that week. When your total gp

created equals or exceeds the market price of one dose of

the poison, that dose is  nished. (You may sometimes be

able to create more than one dose in a week, depending on

your check result and the market price of the poison.) If

you fail the check, you make no progress that week, and if

you fail the check by a margin of 5 or more, you ruin half

the raw materials and have to buy them again.

DO-IT-YOURSELF TRAPS

Traps  have  long  bee n  part  of  the  DMs  arsenal,  but  with

clever  application  of  the  Craft  (trapmaking)  skill,  player

characters can employ them to improve the defenses of their

hideouts  and  fortresses.  DMs  can  also  make  use  of  these

rules to de ne the traps they plan to spring on unwary PCs.

The  following  steps  are  guidelines  for  making  do-it-

yourself traps. Your own sense of fair play should trump

these  formulas  if  a  con ict  exists.  If  these  guidelines

dont  cover  everything  about  a  particularly  interesting

trap  you  want  to  create,  simply  extrapolate  as  needed.

Step 1: Figure out the Concept

Step 1: Figure out the Concept

This  step  drives  all  the  other  decisions  youre  going  to

make. Its the most important, hut also the simplest step

just decide what you want the trap to do.

Types of Traps:A trap can be either mechanical or magi-

cal. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks,

water- lled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that

depends on a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are further

divided into spell and magic device categories. Spell traps

are simply spells that themselves function as traps, such as

 re trap or glyph of warding. Magic device traps initiate spell

effects when activated, just as wands, rods, rings, or other

magic items do. The rules for cost, CR, and construction

differ depending on the type of trap you intend to make.

Elements of a Trap: All trapsmechanical or magi-

calmust  have  the  following  elements:  trigger,  reset,

Search  DC,  Disable  Device  DC,  attack  bonus  (or  saving

throw  or  onset  delay),  damage/effect,  and  Challenge

Rating. Some of these elements may be more or less impor-

tant than others, and some traps may also include optional

elements, such as poison or a bypass.

Step 2: Determine the Trigger and

Reset

Step 2: Determine the Trigger and

Reset

Now that you have a general idea of what you want your

trap to do, you can start de ning the speci cs. The choices

you make here may result in adjustments to the CR and

cost of the trap, as given on Tables 22 and 23. Keep a run-

ning total of these adjustments; youll need them in Step 4.

Trigger

Trigger

The  trigger  element  determines  how  the  trap  is  sprung.

Each trigger type is described in detail below.

Location: A location trigger springs a trap when someone

stands in a particular square. For example, a covered pit trap

typically activates when a creature steps on a certain spot. This

is the most common type of trigger for mechanical traps.

Proximity: This trigger activates the trap when a crea-

ture approaches within a certain distance of it. A proximity

trigger differs from a location trigger in that the creature

need not be standing in a particular square. Creatures that

are  ying can spring a trap with a proximity trigger but not

one with a location trigger. Mechanical proximity triggers

are extremely sensitive to the slightest change in the air.

This, of course, makes them useful only in places such as

crypts, where the air is unusually still.

The alarm  spell  functions  as  a  proximity  trigger  for

magic device traps. You can voluntarily reduce the area of

the spell to make it cover a smaller area.

Some  magic  device  traps  have  special  proximity  trig-

gers  that  activate  onl y  when  certain  kinds  of  creatures

approach. To build such a trigger, add an appropriate spell

(usually a divination) to the trap so that it can differenti-

ate  among  approaching  creatures.  For  example,  a  detect

good spell can serve as a proximity trigger on an evil altar,

springing the attached trap only when someone of good

alignment gets close enough to it.

Sound:  This  magic  trigger  springs  the  trap  when  it

detects any sound. A sound trigger functions like an ear

and has a +15 bonus on listen checks. Silent movement,

magical silence, and other effects that would negate hear-

ing defeat it. To build a sound trigger, add clairaudience to

the trap youre building.

Visual:  This  magic  trigger  works  like  an  actual  eye,

springing the trap whenever it sees something. To incor-

porate a visual trigger into your trap, add one of the spells

listed  on  the  following  table.  Sight  range  and  the  Spot

bonus conferred depend on the spell chosen, as shown.

If you want the trap to see in the dark, you must either

as well. (Darkvision limits the traps sight range in the

dark  to  60  feet.)  If  invisibility,  disguises,  or  illusions

can fool the spell being used, they can fool the visual

trigger as well.

Touch: A touch trigger, which springs the trap when

touched,  is  generally  the  simplest  kind  to  construct.

This  trigger  may  be  physically  attached  to  the  part  of

the mechanism that deals the damage (such as a needle

that springs out of a lock), or it may not. You can make

a magic touch trigger by adding alarm to the trap and

reducing the spells area to cover only the trigger spot.

Timed: This  trigger  periodically  springs  the  trap

after a certain duration has passed. A sharpened pendu-

lum that sweeps across a hallway every 4 rounds is an

example of a timed trigger.

Spell:  All  spell  traps  have  this  type  of  trigger.  The

appropriate spell descriptions in the Players Handbook

explain the trigger conditions for each of these traps.

Reset

Reset

A reset element is simply the set of conditions under

which a trap becomes ready to trigger again. The avail-

able types are explained below.

No Reset: Short of completely rebuilding the trap,

theres no way to trigger it more than once. Spell traps

have the no reset element.

Repair  Reset:  To  get  the  trap  functioning  again,

you must repair it.

Manual  Reset:  Resetting  the  trap  requires  some-

one to move the parts back into place. Its the standard

reset for most mechanical traps.

Automatic  Reset:  The  trap  resets  itself,  either

immediately  or  after  a  timed  interval.  Magic  device

traps get this feature at no cost.

Bypass (Optional Element)

Bypass (Optional Element)

If you plan to move past a trap yourself, its a good idea

to build in a bypass mechanism - something that tem-

porarily disarms the trap. Bypass elements are typically

used  only  with  mechanical  traps;  spell  traps  usually

have built-in allowances for the caster to bypass them.

The  check  DCs  given  below  are  minimums;  raising

them alters the base cost as shown on Table 22.

Lock: A lock bypass requires an Open Lock check

(DC 30) to open.

Hidden Switch: A hidden switch requires a Search

check (DC 25) to locate.

Hidden Lock: A hidden lock combines the features

above, requiring a Search check (DC 25) to locate and

an Open Lock check (DC 30) to open.

Step 3: Figure out the Numbers

Step 3: Figure out the Numbers

Now  that  youve   gured  out  the  trigger,  reset,  and

bypass elements, its time to de ne the traps itself. You

need DCs for Search and Disable Device, plus attack/

saving  throw  and  damage/effect  information.  Keep

your list of cost and CR adjustments running; many of

these elements also change those factors.

Search and Disable Device DCs

Search and Disable Device DCs

The builder sets the Search and Disable Device DCs for a

mechanical trap. For a magic trap, the values depend on

the highest-level spell used.

Mechanical Trap: The base DC for both Search and

Disable Device checks is 20. Raising or lowering either of

these affects the base cost and CRs shown on Table 22.

Magic Trap: The DC for both Search and Disable Device

checks is equal to 25 + spell level of the highest-level spell

used.  Only  characters  wit h  the  traps  ability  can  attempt

either check. These values do not affect the traps cost or CR.

Attacks/Saving Throws

Attacks/Saving Throws

A  trap  usually  either  makes  an  attack  roll  or  forces  a

saving throw to avoid it. Consult one or more of follow-

ing sections to determine which option is appropriate for

your trap, based on its type. Occasionally, a trap uses both

of these options, or neither (see Never-Miss, page 29).

Pits: These are holes (covered or not) that characters can

fall into and take damage. A pit needs no attack roll, but a

successful Re ex save (DC set by the builder) avoids it Other

save-dependent mechanical traps also fall into this category.

Ranged  Attack  Traps:  These  traps   ing   darts,

arrows, spears, or the like at whoever activated the trap.

The builder sets the attack bonus.

Melee Attack Traps: These traps include sharp blades

that  emerge  from  walls  and  stone  blocks  that  fall  from

ceilings. Once again, the builder sets the attack bonus.

Damage/Effect

Damage/Effect

The effect of a trap is simply what happens to those who

spring it. Usually this takes the form of either damage or a

spell effect, but some traps have special effects.

If your trap does hit point damage, calculate the aver-

age damage for a successful hit and round that value to the

nearest multiple of 7. (Damage from poisons and pit spikes

does not count toward this value, but mighty damage and

extra damage from multiple attacks does. For example, if

a  trap   res 1d4  darts  at  each  target,  the  average  damage

is the average number of darts  the average damage per

dart, rounded to the nearest multiple of 7, or 2.5 darts  2.5

points of damage = 6.25 points, which rounds to 7.) Consult

Table 22 to determine the CR bonus.

Pits:  Falling  into  a  pit  deals  1d6  points  of  damage

per 10 feet of depth.

Ranged  Attack  Traps:  These  traps  deal  whatever

damage their ammunition normally would. A trap that

 res longbow arrows, for example, deals 1d8 points of

damage  per  hit.  You  can  also  build  mighty  traps  that

deal extra damage. For example, a mighty (+4 Str bonus)

ranged attack trap that  res shortspears could deal up to

1d8+4 points of damage per successful hit.

Melee  Attack  Traps:  These  traps  dea l  the  sam e

damage as the melee weapons they wield. In the case

of a falling stone block, you can assign any bludgeoning

damage you like, but remember that whoever resets the

trap has to lift that stone back into place. You can also

build mighty traps that deal extra damage.

Spell Traps: Spell traps produce the spells effect as

described in the appropriate entry in the Players Hand-

book. Like all spells, each spell-based trap that allows a

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

saving  throw  has  a  save  DC  equal  to 10  +

spell level + casters relevant ability modi er.

Magic  Device  Traps:  These  traps  pro-

duce  the  effects  of  any  spells  included,  as

described  in  the  appropriate  entries  in  the

Players  Handbook.  If  the  spell  in  a  magic

device  trap  allows  a  saving  throw  at  all,  its

save DC equals 10 + spell level   1.5. Some

spells make attack rolls instead.

Special: Some traps have miscellaneous

features that produce special effects, such as

drowning for a water trap or ability damage

for  poison.  Saving  throws  and  damage

depend on the poison (see Table 21) or are

set by the builder, as appropriate.

Miscellaneous Trap Features

Miscellaneous Trap Features

Some traps include optional features that can

make  them  considerably  more  deadly.  The

most common such features are listed below.

Alchemical  Device:  Mechanical  traps

may incorporate alchemical devices or other

special substances or items, such as tangle-

foot  bags,  alchemists   re,  thunderstones,

and the like. Some such items mimic spell

effects.  For  example,  the  effect  of  a  tangle-

foot  bag  is  similar  to  that  of  an  entangle

spell,  and  the  effect  of  a  thunderstone  is

similar to that of a deafness spell. If the item

mimics a spell effect, it increases the CR as

shown on Table 22.

Gas: With a gas trap, the danger is in the

inhaled poison it delivers. Traps employing

gas  usually  have  the  never-miss  and  onset

delay features.

Never-Miss:  When  the  entire  dungeon

wall moves to crush you, your quick re exes

wont help, since the wall cant possibly miss.

A trap with this feature has neither an attack

bonus nor a saving throw to avoid, but it does

have an onset delay (see below). Most water

and gas traps are also never-miss.

Multiple-Target: Traps with this feature

can affect more than one character.

Onset  Delay:  An  onset  delay  is  the

amount  of  time  between  when  the  trap  is

sprung and when it in icts damage. A never-

miss trap always has an onset delay.

Other Ways to Beat

a Trap

Its  possible  to  ruin  many

traps  without  using  Disable

Device, of course.

Ranged Attack Traps: Once

you know the trap is there, the

obvious  way  to  disable  it  is

to  smash  the  mechanism

assuming  you  have  access

to  it.  Failing  that,  you  can

plug up the holes from which

the  projectiles  emerge.  This

option  gives  you  total  cover

relative to the trap and it also

prevents  the  trap  from   ring

unless  its  ammunition  does

enough  damage

to  break

through the plugs.

Melee  Attack  Traps:  You

can  disable  these  devices  by

smashing

the  mechanism

or  blocking  the  weapons,  as

noted  above.  Alternatively,

if  you  study  the  trap  as  it

triggers, you might be able to

time your dodges just right to

avoid damage. If you are doing

nothing but studying the trap

when it  rst goes off, you gain

a  +4  dodge  bonus  against  its

attacks  if  you  trigger  it  again

within the next minute.

Pits:  Disabling  a  pit  trap

generally  ruins  only  the  trap

door, making it an uncovered

pit. Filling in the pit or building

a  makeshift  bridge  across  it

is  an  application  of  manual

labor, not Disable Device. You

could  also  disable  any  spikes

at  the  bottom  of  the  pit  by

attacking  themthey  break

just like daggers do.

Magic  Traps:  Dispel  magic

works  wonders  here.  If  you

succeed at a caster level check

level,

against  the  creators

you suppress the trap for 1d4

rounds. This works only with a

targeted  dispel  magic,  not  the

area version.

Poison:  Traps  that  employ  poison  are

deadlier  than  their  nonpoisonous  counter-

parts,  so  they  have  correspondingly  higher

CRs. To determine the CR modi er for a given poison,

consult Table 2-4. Only injury, contact, and inhaled poi-

sons are suitable for traps; ingested types are not.

Some traps (such as a table covered with contact poison)

simply deal the poisons damage. Others, such as poisoned

arrows, deliver ranged or melee attacks as well.

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

Repairing and Resetting

Mechanical Traps

Repairing  a  trap  requires  a

Craft

check

(trapmaking)

against a DC equal to the one

for building it in the  rst place.

The  cost  for  raw  materials  is

one- fth of the traps original

market  price.  To  calculate

how long it takes to  x a trap,

use  the  same  calculations

you  would  for  building  it,  but

substitute the cost of the raw

materials  required  for  repair

for the market price.

Resetting

trap  usu-

a

ally  takes  only  a  minute  or

soyou  just  have  to  lever

the  trapdoor  back  into  place,

reload  the  crossbow  behind

the wall, or push the poisoned

needle back into the lock. For

a  trap  with  a  more  dif cult

reset,  such  as  Baltois  boul-

der,  the  DM  should  set  the

time and manpower required.

Pit  Spikes:  Treat  spikes  at  the  bottom  of

a pit as daggers, each with a +10 attack bonus.

The damage bonus for each spike is +1 per 10

feet of pit depth (to a maximum of +5). Each

character who falls into the pit is attacked by

1d4 spikes. Pit spikes do not add to the average

damage  of  the  trap  (see  above),  nor  do  their

damage bonuses constitute mighty damage.

Pit  Bottom:  If  theres  something  other

than spikes at the bottom of a pit, its best to

treat that as a separate trap (see multiple traps)

with a location trigger that activates on any

signi cant impact, such as a falling character.

Possibilities for pit bottom traps include acid,

monsters,  or  water  (which  reduces  the  fall-

ing damage; see the Obstacles, Hazards, and

Traps section in Chapter 4 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Touch Attack: This feature applies to any

trap that needs only a successful touch attack

(melee or ranged) to hit.

Water:  Any  trap  tha t  involves  a  danger

of  drowning  (such  as  a  locked  room   lling

with water or a patch of quicksand that char-

acters can fall into) is in this category. Traps

employing water usually have the never-miss

and onset delay features (see above).

CR for the Trap

CR for the Trap

To calculate the CR for a trap, add all the CR modi ers col-

lected above to the base CR value for the trap type.

Mechanical  Trap:  The  base  CR  for  a  mechanical

trap  is  0.  If  your   nal  CR  is  0  or  below,  add  features

until you get a CR of 1 or better.

Magic Trap: For a spell or magic device trap, the base CR

is 1. Only the highest-level spell used modi es the CR.

Multiple Traps: If a trap is really two or more con-

nected  traps  that  affect  approximately  the  same  area,

determine the CR of each one separately.

Multiple  Dependent  Traps:  If  one  trap  depends  on  the

success of the other (that is, you can avoid the second trap

altogether by not falling victim to the  rst), they must be

treated as two separate traps.

Multiple Independent Traps: If two or more traps act inde-

pendently  (that  is,  neither  depends  on  the  success  of  the

other to activate), use their CRs to determine their combined

Encounter level as though they were monsters, according to

Table 41 in the Dungeon Masters Guide. The resulting

Encounter level is the CR for the combined traps.

Step 4: Figure out the Cost

Step 4: Figure out the Cost

Cost depends on the type of trap. Calculations are given

below for the three basic types.

30

Mechanical Trap

Mechanical Trap

The base cost of a mechanical trap is 1,000 gp. Apply all

the  modi ers  from  Table  22  for  the  various  features

youve added to the trap to get the modi ed base cost.

The  market  price  is  the  modi ed  base  cost  

the  Challenge  Rating  +  extra  costs.  The  minimum

market  price  for  a  mechanical  trap  is  100  gp  per  +1

CR.  After  youve  multiplied  the  modi ed  base  cost  by

the  Challenge  Rating,  add  the  price  of  any  poison  or

alchemical devices you incorporated into the trap. If the

trap  uses  one  of  these  elements  and  has  an  automatic

reset, multiply the poison or alchemical device cost by 20

to ensure an adequate supply.

Multiple Traps:  If  a  trap  is  really  two  or  more

connected  traps,  determine  the  market  price  of  each

separately, then add those values together. This holds for

both dependent and independent traps.

Magic Device Trap

A one-shot magic device trap costs 50 gp x caster level 

spell level + extra costs plus 4 XP  caster level  spell level.

Magic traps with the automatic reset feature cost 500 gp 

caster level  spell level + extra costs plus 40 XP  caster

level  spell level. If the trap uses more than one spell (for

instance, a sound or visual trigger spell in addition to the

main spell effect), you must pay for them all (except alarm,

which is free).

These costs assume that you are casting the necessary

spells  yourself.  If  you  are  hiring  an  NPC  spellcaster  to

cast them, see the Special and Superior Items section of

Chapter 7 in the Players Handbook for costs.

Magic device traps take one day to build per 500 gp cost.

A spell trap has a cost only if you hire an NPC spellcaster

to cast it. See the Special and Superior Items section in

Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook for these costs.

Step 5: Craft the Trap

Step 5: Craft the Trap

Now that youre  nished with the design, its time to build

the trap. Depending upon the components, this may require

purchasing raw materials, using the Craft (trapmaking) skill,

casting spells, or some combination of these steps.

Mechanical Traps

Mechanical Traps

Building a mechanical trap is a three-step process. You

must  rst calculate the DC for the Craft (trapmaking)

check,  then  purchase  the  raw  materials,  and   nally

make a Craft (trapmaking) check every week until the

construction is  nished.

The Craft Check DC:  The  base  DC  for  the  Craft

(trapmaking)  check  depends  on  the  CR  of  the  trap,  as

given in Table 25.

Variant: Helpful Traps

You can use the rules for magic de-

vice  traps  to  construct  itemsthat

help  you  rather  than  hurt  you.

Build  such  a  device  just  as  you

would a magic trap, but use a help-

ful spell rather than a harmful one.

For  example,  Mialee  could

build  a  sickbed  that  improves

the Constitution of anyone who

lies in it. Its a location-trigger,

automatic-reset,  magic  trap

that casts endurance on anyone

who lies down on it. Endurance

is  a  2nd-level  spell,  so  the  de-

vice costs Mialee 500 gp  3  2

= 3,000 gp in raw materials and

40 XP  3  2 = 240 XP. It takes

her six days (one per 500 gp of

cost) to craft the magic bed. If

a  spy  wanted  to  sabotage  such

a device, the DC for the Disable

Device  check  would  be  27  (25

+ 2).

Bene cial  devices  have  no

CRs  because  they  arent  chal-

lenges.  Its  certainly  fair  for  the

DM  to  mandate  that  they  be

stationary,  though  this  is  not

absolutely necessary.

Modifer to Craft

(Trapmaking) DC

+5

Add any modi ers from the second part of the table to the

base value obtained in the  rst part. The result is the Craft

(trapmaking) DC.

Buying Raw Materials:  Raw  materials  (including

weapons, poison, and incidental items) typically cost a to-

tal of one-third of the traps market price. At the DMs dis-

cretion, however, unusual traps may require raw materials

that arent available where the trap is being constructed.

This forces the builder to either undertake a journey to

obtain them or pay a higher cost. For example, giant scor-

pion  venom  may  not  be  readily  available  to  a  character

whos fortifying a polar ice castle.

Making the Checks: To  gure out how much progress

you make on the trap each week, make a Craft (trapmak-

ing) check. If it is successful, multiply the check result by

the DC for the check. The result is how many gp worth

of work you accomplished that week. When your total gp

completed equals or exceeds the market price of the trap,

its  nished. If you fail the check, you make no progress that

week, and if you fail the check by a margin of 5 or more, you

ruin half the raw materials and have to buy them again.

Check Modi ers: You need artisans tools to build a proper

trap. Using improvised tools imposes a 2 circumstance

penalty on the Craft (trapmaking) check, but masterwork

artisans tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus. In addi-

tion, dwarves get a +2 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking)

checks for building traps that involve stone or metal.

Assistance:  If  the  trap  requires  construction  work,  it

helps to have another set of hands available, even if theyre

unskilled. Unless the trap is so small that only one person

can  effectively  work  on  it  at  a  time,  the  help  of  one  or

more  assistants  speeds  the  work  along.  As  long  as  you

have  the  optimal  number  of  assistants  (DMs  decision

as to how many that is) helping you,

you  accomplish  double  the  gp

equivalent  of  work  each  week

that  you  could  have

alone.

Example Trap:

Example Trap:

Baltois Rolling

Baltois  Rolling

Bolder

Bolder

Heres an example

of how the trapmak-

ing rules work.

Step 1 (Concept): Baltoi

the dwarven rogue wants to

construct a trap to prevent incur-

sions  into  her  underground  lair.

She has in mind a huge boulder that

rolls down the entry corridor, crushing

the intruders.

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

Step 2 (Trigger, Reset, and Bypass): Baltoi has had

bad luck with  ying intruders, so she wants a proxim-

ity  triggera  very  sensitive  apparatus  that  starts  the

rock  rolling  upon  the  slightest  disturbance  in  the  air.

A manual reset sounds just  ne to her, even

though  itll  take  all  her  guards  to  roll  the

boulder  back  int o  position.  For  a  bypass,

Baltoi opts for a well-hidden switch (Search

DC 30 to locate). The proximity trigger adds

+1,000  gp  to  the  base  cost  and  the  bypass

switch adds another +400 gp. The manual

reset doesnt change the cost. None of these

components change the CR. Base cost modi-

 er  so  far +1,400 gp. CR modi er  so  far +0.

Step 3 (Numbers): Trying to save some

money,  Baltoi  doesnt  spend  too  much

effort  hiding  the  big  hole  in  the  ceiling

through  which  the  boulder  drops.  She

reduces  the  Search  DC  to  16,  thus  saving

400 gp from the base cost. But as a point of

pride in dwarven stonecraft, she leaves the

Disable Device DC at 20. Base cost modi er so

far: +1,000 gp. CR modi er so far: +0.

The  rolling  boulder  is  a  melee  attack,

and Baltoi wants to make sure it connects.

Therefore, she decides to increase its attack

bonus to +15, which adds +1,000 gp to the

base cost and increases the CR by +1. Base

cost  modi er  so  far.  +2,000  gp.  CR  modi er  so

far. +1.

Baltoi  picks  a  boulder  big  enough  to  do

6d6  points  of  damage.  Its  average  damage

is  21  points  (+3  CR  for  high  average  dam-

age), and its wide enough to hit two intruders standing

abreast (+1 CR for multiple targets). Base cost modi er so

far +2,000 gp. CR modi er so far +5.

Step  4  (Cost):  The  base  cost  is  1,000  gp.  Adding

the  base  cost  modifier  of  +2,000  gp  gives  Baltoi  a

modified base cost of 3,000 gp. Multiplying that by

the final CR value (5) gives the market price of the

trap: 15,000 gp.

Step 5 (Craft): Table 25 gives the base DC for a

CR 5 trap as 25. Adding the +5 modi er for the

proximity trigger gives a  nal Craft (trapmak-

ing) DC of 30. Baltoi buys 5,000 gp worth of

raw materials (one-third of the traps mar-

ket price) and gets to work. Baltoi normally

has a Craft (trapmaking) bonus of +19. For the

purpose of this trap, she gets an additional +2 for

being  a  dwarf

w o r k i n g

with

stone

and  another

+2  for  using

masterwork

tools,  giving

her  a  total

31

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

Craft (trapmaking) bonus of +23. Her  rst roll is a 15. Adding

23 gives her a check result of 38success! Multiplying 38 by

the DC for the check (30) results in 1,140 gp worth of work

completed  the   rst  week.  The  DM  says  that

 ve assistants would be useful building such

a  trap,  and  she  easily  has  that  many  helpers

to  call  upon  in  her  complex.  Her  assistants

double  the  amount  of  work  completed,

giving  her  a   rst-week  total  of  2,280  gp.

Building such a trap is no easy task, it seems!

Assuming average rolls, itll take Baltoi another

seven weeks to complete the trap. Maybe the

proximity trigger was a poor choice....

Magic Traps

Building a magic trap is a simpler process

than constructing a mechanical one. Costs

are as noted in Step 4, above.

Magic Device Traps:  Building  these

traps  doesnt  involve  the  Craft  (trapmaking)

skill  at  all.  Instead,  it  requires  the  Craft

Wondrous  Item  featmagic  device  traps

are, after all, essentially stationary wondrous

items, though they cost more to create than

wondrous items do. If you have that feat and

can cast the spells required to build the trap,

success is automatic. The time required is one

day per 500 gp spent on raw materials.

Spell Traps: All you need to do to place

this trap is actually cast the spell. No other

checks are required.

90 Sample Traps

The  following  traps  use  the  construction

rules above and are suitable for protecting a

dungeon,  merchant  guildhouse,  or  military

complex.  The  costs  listed  for  mechanical

traps are market prices; those for magic device

traps are raw material costs. Caster level and

class  for  the  spells  used  to  produce  the  trap

effects are provided in the entries for magic

device and spell traps. For all other spells used

(in  triggers,  for  example),  the  caster  level  is

assumed to be the minimum required.

CR 1

Variant: What Disabling a

Device Means

So  youve  made  your  Dis-

able  Device  check  against  a

trap. What does that do to it?

It  depends  on  the  amount  by

which you beat the DC. Check

the  paragraph  below  that  cor-

responds  to  your  margin  of

success for the results.

03: The next time the trigger

would spring the trap, it doesnt.

After  that,  however,  the  trigger

operates normally, and another

Disable Device check is required

to disarm it again.

46:  You  messed  it  up.  It

wont work again until its reset.

If its a trap that resets automati-

cally, use the next result below.

79:  You  really  broke  it.  It

wont  go  off  again  until  some-

one  repairs  it  using  the  Craft

(trapmaking)  skill.  This  repair

costs  1d8    10%  of  the  traps

total  construction  cost.  If  you

dont  wish  to  destroy  the  trap

mechanism, you can voluntarily

reduce the repair cost required.

10+:  You  can  either  break

the trap as above or add a by-

pass  element.  This  latter  op-

tion enables you to either get

past the trap without trigger-

ing  it  or  avoid  its  effect.  For

example,you  could  disable

a  narrow  path  through  the

pressure  plates  that  trigger

poison darts from the wall, or

note the tiny niche in the wall

that provides refuge from the

rolling boulder.

NEW WAYS TO USE SKILLS

This section offers novel uses of the Hide and Pick Pocket

skills, plus variant rules for using Disable Device and Tumble.

The Fine Art of Hiding

The Fine Art of Hiding

If youre a rogue, hiding is probably a signi cant part of

your  typical  adventuring  routine.  But  you  can  do  much

more  with  this  skill  than  just  stay  out  of  sight.  You  can

tail a quarry, sneak up on someone, blend into a crowd,

36

act as a sniper, and even improve your chances of avoiding

detection while invisible.

A Hide check is opposed by an opponents Spot check.

Therefore, the  rst requirement for a successful attempt is

someplace to hide. No matter how good you are at hiding,

you cannot hide in the open unless you have some special

ability that allows you to do so (such as the shadowdancers

hide in plain sight ability; see Chapter 2 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide). Otherwise, you need some sort of cover.

Anything that gives you at least one-half concealment can

serve as a hiding place-a piece of furniture, a bush, or even

a deep shadow is suf cient.

Special Hiding Situations

Special Hiding Situations

The standard use of the Hide skill assumes that you  nd

someplace to hide and stay put until you decide to leave.

In the larger sense, however, hiding is the art of remaining

unseen, and you can make use of that in many ways. For

example,  your  Hide  skill  can  help  you  stay  out  of  sight

at  the  beginning  of  an  encounter  (see  the  Hiding  and

Spotting section in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide). You can also try any number of special tricks with

the Hide skill, such as those detailed below.

Tail  Someone:  Since  the  Hide  skill  allows  for

movement, you can use it as a move-equivalent action or

part of a move action if desired. This means you can try

to  follow  someone  while  making  periodic  Hide  checks

to  remain  unseen.  How  often  you  need  a  Hide  check

depends on the distance at which you follow. If you stay

at least 60 feet away from your quarry, you can get by with

a Hide check once every 10 minutes, provided that your

quarry  doesnt  suspect  youre  following  and  that  you  do

nothing but maintain the tail. At distances of less than 60

feet, you must make a Hide check each round.

Of  course,  you  still  need  appropriate  concealment  to

succeed  at  Hide  checks  while  tailing,  but  often  many

options are available. If youre trying to tail someone on

a city street, for example, you can duck behind passersby-

though  in  that  case,  you  wouldnt  be  hidden  from  the

people youre using for cover, just from your quarry. If the

street  is  fairly  crowded,  using  passersby  as  concealment

imposes no penalty on your Hide check, though you might

still suffer a penalty for your movement (see the Hide skill

description in Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook).

If  you  dont  have  moving  people  to  hide  behind,  you

can  instead  move  from  one  hiding  place  to  another  as

you follow your quarry. Distance is a factor, though - this

option  works  only  as  long  as  your  next  hiding  place  is

within 1 foot per Hide rank you possess of your current

hiding place. (If you have a magic item that helps you hide,

such as a cloak of elevenkind or a robe of blending, add 1

foot to your limit per point of Hide bonus it provides.) If

you try to move any greater distance than that between

hiding  places,  your  quarry  spots  you.  In  addition,  a

movement penalty may apply to your Hide check if you

dash from one hiding place to the next at more than half

your normal speed.

Even if you fail a Hide check while tailing someone or

are  spotted  while  moving  too  great  a  distance  between

hiding  places,  you  can  attempt  a  Bluff  check  opposed

by  your  quarrys  Sense  Motive  check  to  look  innocuous.

Success  means  your  quarry  sees  you,  but  doesnt  realize

youre tailing; failure alerts him or her that youre actually

following. A modi er may apply to the Sense Motive check,

depending  on  how  suspicious  your  quarry  is.  The  table

below lists Sense Motive modi ers for particular situations.

Your Quarry . . .                                                   Modi er

Sneak up on Someone: You can sneak up on someone

using Hide checks, but you must move from hiding place

to  hiding  place  to  do  so.  Use  the  procedure  in  the  Tail

Someone section (above) for this. If your last hiding place

is within 1 foot per Hide rank you possess of your quarry,

you can sneak up and attack before he or she sees you.

Blend  into  a  Crowd:  You  can  use  the  Hide  skill  to

blend into a crowd, but doing so conceals you only from

someone scanning the area to  nd you. You remain visible

to everyone around you, and if they happen to be hostile,

theyre likely to point you out. Even if you fail a Hide check

while  skulking  in  a  crowd,  you  can  still  attempt  a  Bluff

check to look innocuous (see Tail Someone, above).

Sniping:  If  youve  already  successfully  hidden  at

least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged

attack, then immediately hide again as a move action.

You  suffer  a  -20  circumstance  penalty  on  your  Hide

check to conceal yourself after the shot.

Hiding While Invisible: You can evade detection

by a spell such as see invisibility with a successful Hide

check, provided you have a proper hiding place.

Concealed Weapons

Concealed Weapons

The description of the Pick Pocket skill notes that it can

be useful for hiding items on your person. But what if

that item is a dagger?

In  general,  a  Pick  Pocket  check  to  hide  a  weapon  is

opposed by someone elses Spot check (if youre being

casually  observed)  or  Search  check  (if  youre  being

frisked).  Under  these  circumstances,  a  Search  check

gets a +4 bonus because its usually not too hard to  nd

a  weapon  when  youre  frisking  someone.  Additional

modi ers may also apply to both checks, as given on the

table at top right.

Untrained  Concealment  Attempts:  The  Pick

Pocket  skill  cannot  be  used  untrained.  If  a  character

without  that  skill  tries  to  conceal  a  weapon,  its  no

longer an opposed check. Instead, anyone observing the

character with the concealed weapon gets a Spot check,

and anyone frisking that character gets a Search check.

The base DC for each Spot or Search check is 10, and all

Variant: Tougher Tumble Checks

Variant: Tougher Tumble Checks

For those who would like a more complex (and more

severe)  way  to  treat  Tumble  checks  in  combat,  here

are  two  variants:  circumstance  penalties  and  opposed

tumble checks.

Circumstance Penalties:  In  this  variant,  the

base  DCs  for  tumbling  around  an  opponent  and  for

tumbling  through  an  occupied  square  remain  the

same  (DC  15  and  25,  respectively).  However,  in  less

than  perfect  conditions  (such  as  those  in  a  typical

dungeon), bad lighting and uneven ground can make

Tumble  checks  more  dif cult  than  normal.  Consult

the following chart for appropriate penalties.

Circumstance

Bad lighting (torches or similar light source)

Dusty or eneven  oor

Light debris (occasional pebbles or trash)

Wet  oor

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

Circumstance penalties stack as long as they represent

different  circumstances,  so  add  any  applicable  entries

from the above list together. For example, if a dusty  oor

(2)  also  has  hones  scattered  across  it  (4),  apply  a  6

circumstance penalty on the Tumble check.

This variant makes tumbling in combat more dif cult.

Nevertheless, it does not prevent high-level characters with

the Tumble skill from tumbling rings around their foes.

Opposed Tumble Checks: Its logical that it would

be tougher to tumble around an experienced combatant

than a weaker foe. Rather than allow a successful Tumble

check to eliminate the chance for attacks of opportunity

altogether,  allow  the  defender  to  make  a  Re ex  save

(DC equal to the Tumble check result). If the tumbler

is  actually  moving  through  the  defenders  space,  a  +10

bonus applies to this Re ex save. A defender who makes

the  save  may  make  an  attack  of  opportunity  against

the  tumbling  character;  failure  means  no  attack  of

opportunity is allowed. Failed Tumble checks generate

attacks of opportunity normally.

Note: This variant is more detailed than the Counter

Tumble variant given in Chapter 4 of Sword and Fist: A

Guidebook to Fighters and Monks. Dungeon Masters with

access to both books should choose which variant they

prefer and inform their players of the choice made.

Speeding  Combat:  A  character  with  a  Tumble

skill modi er of +14 or higher need not make Tumble

checks to move past opponents anymore.

FEATS

Feats are an exciting element of the D&D game. This

section  presents  new  feats  designed  with  bards  and

rogues  in  mind,  though  of  course  any  character  who

quali es can take them.

Acrobatic [General]

You have excellent body awareness and coordination.

Bene  t: You get a +2 bonus on all Jump and Tumble

checks.

Alluring [General]

Alluring [General]

Others have an inexplicable urge to believe your every

word.

Prerequisite: Persuasive, Trustworthy

Bene  t:  You  get  a  +2  bonus  on  Diplomacy  checks

and add +2 to the save DCs of all your mind-affecting,

language-dependent spells.

cumulative  blood  lossthat  is,  two  successful  arterial

strikes  do  an  additional  2  points  of  damage  per  round.

Blood loss, whether from one such wound or several, stops

when the victim receives one successful Heal check, any

cure spell, or any other form of magical healing. Creatures

not subject to sneak attacks are immune to this effect.

Athletic [General]

Athletic [General]

Youre physically  t and adept at outdoor sports.

Bene t: You get a +2 bonus on Climb and Swim checks.

Charlatan [General]

Charlatan [General]

Youre  adept  at  fooling  people.  You  know  how  to  tell

them just what they want to hear.

Bene t: You get a +2 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.

Chink  in the Armor [General]

You are an expert at slipping a weapon between armor

plates or into seams.

Prerequisite: Expertise.

Bene  t:  If  you  take  a  standard  action  to  study  an

opponent, you can ignore half of his or her armor bonus

(rounded  down)  during  your  next  single  attack.  Only

bonuses from actual armor (including natural armor) are

halved, not those from shields, enhancement bonuses to

armor, or magic items that provide an armor bonus.

Dash [General]

Dash [General]

You move faster than normal for your race.

Bene  t: If you are wearing light armor or no armor

and are carrying a light load, your speed is 5 feet faster

than it normally would be.

You can cast spells without observers noticing.

Prerequisite: Bardic music ability, 12+ ranks in Perform.

Bene  t:  You  have  mastered  the  art  of  casting  spells

unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic components

into  your  performances  so  skillfully  that  others  rarely

catch you in the act. Like a silent, stilled spell, a disguised

spell cant be identi ed through a Spellcraft check. Your

performance is obvious to everyone in the vicinity, but

the fact that you are casting a spell isnt. Unless the spell

visibly emanates from you or observers have some other

means of determining its source, they dont know where

the effect came from. A disguised spell uses up a spell

slot one level higher than the spells actual level.

Arterial Strike [General]

Arterial Strike [General]

Your  sneak  attacks  target  large  blood  vessels,  leaving

wounds that cause massive blood loss.

Prerequisite: Base attack +4, sneak attack ability.

Bene  t: If you hit with a sneak attack, you may choose

to  forgo  +1d6  points  of  extra  sneak  attack  damage  to

deliver  a  wound  that  wont  stop  bleeding.  Each  wound

38

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

melee attacks for any reason. You take your extra attack

when its your turn, either before or after your regular

action.  If  several  foes  are  within  melee  reach  and

denied Dexterity bonuses against your attacks, you can

use this feat against only one of them.

Note: This feat  rst appeared in Sword and Fist. This

version supersedes the one originally printed there.

Extra Music [General]

You  can  use  your  bardic  music  more  often  than  you

otherwise could.

Prerequisite: Bardic music ability.

Bene  t:  You  can  use  your  bardic  music  four  extra

Flick of the Wrist [General]

Flick of the Wrist [General]

Fleet of Foot [General]

You run so nimbly that you can turn corners without

losing momentum.

Prerequisites: Dex 15+, Run.

Bene  t: When running or charging, you can make a

single direction change of 90 degrees or less. You cant

use this feat while wearing medium or heavy armor, or

if youre carrying a load heavier than light.

Normal:  Without  this  feat  you  can  run  or  charge

only in a straight line.

Bene  t:  You  can  alter  any  of  your  mind-affecting

bardic  music  or  virtuoso  performance  effects  so  that

they in uence plants and plant creatures in addition to

any other creatures they would normally affect.

Normal:  Plants  are  normally  immune  to  all  mind-

in uencing effects.

Hamstring [General]

Hamstring [General]

You can wound an opponents legs, hampering his or

her movement.

Prerequisite: Base attack +4, sneak attack ability.

Bene  t: If you hit with a sneak attack, you may choose

39

CHAPTER 2: SKILLS AND FEATS

reduction  ends  when  the  target  receives  healing  (a

successful  Heal  check,  any  cure  spell,  or  other  magi-

cal  healing)  or  after  24  hours,  whichever  comes   rst.

A hamstring attack does not slow creatures that are im-

mune to sneak attack damage or those that have either

no legs at all or more than four legs. It takes two success-

ful hamstring attacks to affect a quadruped.

Jack of All Trades [General]

Jack of All Trades [General]

Youve picked up a smattering of even the most obscure

skills.

Prerequisite: Character level 8th+.

Bene  t: You can use any skill untrained, even those

Your  bardic  music  stays  with  the  listeners  long  after

the last note has died away.

Prerequisite: Bardic music ability.

Bene  t:  If  you  use  bardic  music  to  inspire  compe-

tence, inspire courage, or inspire greatness, the effects

last twice as long as they otherwise would.

Normal: Inspire courage and inspire greatness last

as long as the bard sings, plus an additional 5 rounds

thereafter. Inspire con dence lasts 2 minutes.

Multicultural [General]

Multicultural [General]

You blend in well with members of another race.

Prerequisite: Speak Language (your chosen race).

Bene  t:  Choose  any  one  humanoid  race  other  than

your  own.  Whenever  you  meet  members  of  that  race,

they are likely to treat you as one of their own. You gain a

your chosen race (according to the NPC Attitudes section

in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Obscure Lore [General]

Obscure Lore [General]

Your  hands  can  move  so  quickly  that  observers  dont

see what youve done.

Prerequisite: Dexterity 19+.

Bene  t:  While  under  direct  observation,  you  can

make a Bluff check as a move-equivalent action, opposed

by the Spot checks of any observers. If you succeed, your

misdirection makes them look elsewhere while you take

a partial action. If your partial action is an attack against

someone who failed the opposed check, that opponent is

denied a Dexterity bonus to AC.

Requiem [General]

Requiem [General]

Your bardic music affects undead creatures.

Prerequisite: Bardic music ability, 12+ ranks in Perform.

Bene  t: You can extend your mind-affecting bardic

music  and  virtuoso  performance  effects  so  that  they

in uence  even  the  undead.  All  bardic  music  effects

on undead creatures have only half the duration they

normally would against the living.

in uencing effects.

Shadow [General]

Shadow [General]

You are good at following someone surreptitiously.

Bene  t: You gain a +2 competence bonus on Hide and

Spot checks made while following a speci c person.

Snatch Weapon [General]

Snatch Weapon [General]

You can disarm an opponent, then pluck the weapon

from midair.

weapon in one hand, you can immediately make a single

attack with it, though you suffer the usual penalties for a

second attack with an off-hand weapon.

Normal:  After  a  successful  disarm  attempt,  the

weapon  winds  up  at  the  defenders  feet,  unless  you

attempted the disarm attack while unarmed.

Subsonics [General]

Subsonics [General]

Your music can affect even those who do not consciously

hear it.

Prerequisite: Bardic music ability, 10+ ranks in Perform.

Bene  t: You can play so softly that opponents do not

notice it, yet your allies still gain all the usual bene ts from

your  bardic  music.  Similarly,  you  can  affect  opponents

within  range  with  your  music,  and  unless  they  can  see

you performing or have some other means of discovering

it, they cannot determine the source of the effect.

Trustworthy [General]

Trustworthy [General]

Others feel comfortable telling you their secrets.

Normal: Fire generally does 1d6 points of damage. A

Bene  t: You gain a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy and

successful Re ex save (DC 15) extinguishes it.

Gather Information checks.

CHAPTER 3 :

BARD AND

ROGUE

EQUIPMENT

What would a bard be without his instrument? Or a rogue

without her lockpicks? Like a  ghters weapon of choice,

these items go beyond merely usefultheyre the means

by which a character achieves a key class function.

This  chapter  offers  additional  mundane  equipment

tosupplement  the  lists  in  Chapter  7  of  the  Players

Handbook,  as  well  as  new  magic  items  to  expand  the

options  presented  in  Chapter  8  of  the  Dungeon

Masters  Guide.  No  one  character  is  likely  to  use  all

these items, but any bard or rogue should  nd some of

them extremely useful, and occasionally even life-saving.

BARDS AND THEIR

INSTRUMENTS

An instrument provides a focus for the bards art and

helps  distinguish  him  from  a  mere  street  minstrel.

Itsalso an important part of his self-image. The choice

of  an  unusual  signature  instrument  marks  a  bard  as

someone  out  of  the  ordinarydifferent  even  from

other members of his profession.

When choosing an instrument, consider the following

points.

If  the  instrument  isnt  portable,  you  cant  carry  it

alongon your adventures. A pipe organ may be quite

impressive,  but  a  lute  or  harp  is  likely  to  do  you  far

more good in the long run.

Your  instrument  should  be  durable  enough  to

weather rough handling. After all, you never know

when youre going to run into a music critic intent

on  reducing  your  beloved  instrument  to  so  much

kindling. It may be a good idea to have the mending

spell  in  your  repertoireor  at  the  very  least,  to

keep  a  scroll  with  that  spell  on  it  tucked  in  among

yoursheet music. Besides, mending is always good for

maintaining  the  immaculate  appearance  that  helps

you captivate an audience.

Your instrument cant be one of a kind. In addition

tothe  normal  wear  and  tear  that  adventuring

in icts onitems, you might well lose your favorite

pipes  througha  dimensional  vortex  or  in  a  close

call  with  a  disintegrate  spell.  Loss  of  a  signature

instrument  is  a  sad  event  forany  bard,  just  as  it

would  be  for  a   ghter  who  lost  a  favorite  sword.

But  if  you  dont  want  it  to  cripple  youfrom  that

day forward, you had better be able to replace your

instrument. Common instruments (lutes, lap-harps,

and the like) are much easier to replace than more

exotic instruments are.

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Finally,

is

your

instrument

a

re ectionon  you.  It  should  have  a

sense  of  styleand  convey  something

about  your  personality.  A  hal ing  bard

who  carries  a   ne  old  mandolin  sends

a  very  differentmessage  than  does  one

who  sports  a  jaunty  banjolele.  Find  an

instrument that matches the image you

have  of  yourselfpopular  entertainer,

artiste, passionate performer/composer,

or  carefree  wandererand  use  it  to

convey that image to others.

Types of Instruments

Types of Instruments

This  section  presents  a  wide  variety  of

mundane  instrumentsprimarily  wood-

winds,  horns,  strings,  and  percussion

types.  Not  all  these  instruments  exist

inthe  real  world,  and  many  of  the  ones

that  do  have  been  altered  to  create  more

interesting options for play. Because each

instrument  is  handcrafted,  no  two  are

exactly  alikethus  the  size,  the  number

of  holes  or  strings,  and  other  features

canvary  even  between  two  examples  of

the same instrument.

Although each bard usually has a favorite

instrument, theres nothing other than his

carrying  capacity  to  prevent  himfrom

carrying  around  several  differentones.

Then he can always choose the instrument

thats  most  appropriate  for  any  given

occasion.

Instrument Descriptions

Instrument Descriptions

Each  of  the  following  entries  offers  a

brief  description  of  an  instrument  and

notes  on  what  races  or  creature  types

favor  it.  Because  of  their  easy  availability

and  wide  range  of  notes,  the  three  prime

bardic instruments are the  ddle, the lap-

harp,  and  the  lute.  Player  character  bards

can,  of  course,  choose  any  instruments

they  are  capable  of  playing.  NPC  bards

and  musicians,  however,  usually  choose

the  types  their  races  favor.  A  few  races

have  physical  limitations  that  prevent

them  from  playing  certain  instruments.

Lizardfolk, for example, lack the necessary

lips  and  tongue  shape  for  woodwinds  and  pipes,  and

their  ngers are neither delicate nor dexterous enough

to  pluck  strings.  Dragons  have  similar  limitations,  so

they  rarely  play  instruments  other  than  water-pipes

except  in  shapechanged  form.  Dragons  in  humanoid

form  tend  to  prefer  complicated,  subtle  instruments

such  as  pipe  organs,  lutes,  or  harps,  though  they  are

capable of playing anything they wish.

Variant: Vocalists and

Instrumentalists

Traditionally,  bards  activate

their  bardic  music  abilities

through a combination of sing-

ing  and  instrumental  music.

For  variety,  however,  you  can

introduce bards who specialize

in  only  one  or  the  other.  Such

characters  have

full  access

to  bard  abilities;  they  simply

exercise  them  in  slightly  differ-

ent ways. No bard should have

a  disadvantage  compared  to

other bards because of the way

he  chooses  to  use  his  bardic

music  abilities.  For  instance,

an  instrumentalist  (see  below)

is  no  less  accomplished  at  us-

ing  bardic  music  just  because

he does not sing in addition to

playing an instrument.

Accompanied  Singer:  This  is

the  standard  bard,  who  both

plays  and  sings  to  achieve

bardic  music  effects.  He  uses

an  instrument  that  leaves  his

mouth  free  for  singing,  such

asa lute, lap-harp, or  ddle.

Vocalist:  This  bard  eschews

instruments  altogether.  His

bardic music effects stem from

singing  alone,  without  accom-

paniment.  His  voice  is  a  deli-

cate  instrument  with  enough

range,  expression,  and  force

to  move  audiences  and  even

achievesonic  effects  without

any aid.

Instrumentalist: A master of

his instrument, this bard need

not  say  a  word  to  bring  the

most  hard-hearted  of  listen-

ers  to  tears  (with  a  successful

Perform  check,  of  course).  He

can convey all the emotion and

subtlety  required  through  his

instrument alone, without add-

ing words.

41

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Each of these instruments also provides

a special enhancement to bardic music in

the hands of anyone with that ability. Some

of  these  enhancements  alter  particular

bardic  music  effects;  others  affect  the

listeners in new ways. If the enhancement

alters  an  existing  bardic  music  effect,

only  the  stated  aspects  change;  all  else

pertaining to that effect remains the same.

For  new  effects,  unless  otherwise  stated,

the listeners are all those who can hear the

music,  and  the  effect  lasts  as  long  as  the

performance does. Musicians without the

bardic  music  ability  cannot  achieve  these

special effects at all, and even bards get the

bardic music bene t only with masterwork

versions  of  the  instruments.  For  each

performance  with  such  an  instrument,  a

bard can choose either the special bene t

or the +2 bonus on Perform checks that a

masterwork instrument ordinarily grants.

favorite  of

Alphorn:  A

the  more

sophisticated  giant  races,  the  alphorn  (or

white  horn)  is  a  long,  straight,  wooden

pipe  with  an  upturned  bell  at  the  very

end.  The  pipe  is  typically  12-20  feet

long  and  wound  with  birch  bark,  which

gives  the  instrument  its  pale  color  and

tone.  To  play  an

distinctive  hollow

alphorn,  the  musician  rests  the  bend  of

the  instrument  on  the  ground  and  blows

into the mouthpiece. Since alphorns have

no  ngerholes for altering the pitch, each

can  produce  only  one  note.  An  alphorns

sound carries for great distances, so some

isolated giants use it to communicate with

their  distant  neighbors.  An  unfriendly

critic once compared the result to wolves

baying  at  the  moon,  but  his  heirs  issued

a  lavish  posthumous  apology  after  the

offended  giants  showed  him  the  error  of

his ways.

Bardic  Music:  The  alphorns  deep  pitch

carries its sound to a distance of 1d10 miles.

This  allows  the  use  of  inspire  greatness,

countersong,  and  inspire  courage  effects

even  when  great  distances  separate  the

musician from his or her listeners.

Undead Bards

Undead bards face special prob-

lems  that  their  living  counter-

parts  can  hardly  imagine.  Skel-

etons  lack  the  lips  and  tongues

necessary  to  play  most  horns

and  woodwinds,  while  zombies

dont  have  enough  breath  to

sound  pipes,  woodwinds,  and

horns.  An  immaterial  undead

cant  touch  instruments  at  all,

except for those that have some-

how  followed  their  owners  into

the  afterlifemany  tales  tell  of

spectral drummers, ghostly pip-

ers, and the like.

Any bard who single-mindedly

pursued  his  craft  in  life  is  likely

to  do  the  same  in  death,  even

though the effects of an undead

bards  music  may  be  anything

but  wholesome.  Ghostly  bards

may,  of  course,  use  their  songs

or instruments to achieve bardic

music effects, just as living bards

can. But a bard who has become

a  ghost  can  also  manifest  one

or  more  of  his  undead  abilities

through  the  ghastly,  haunting

music  he  produces.  Thus,  it

comes as no surprise that fright-

ful  moan  is  a  favorite  ability

choice for bard ghosts.

Other  undead  musicians,  of

course, are another matter. Nec-

romancers  with  macabre  tastes

may  use  their  spells  to  make

skeletons  or  zombies  provide

entertainmentsuch

musical

creatures  certainly  have

the

wherewithal to play simple tunes

on  lutes,  harps,   ddles,  and

percussion  instruments.  When

adjudicating  the  matter,  con-

sider  the  physical  and  mental

limitations  of  the  performers,

the effect desired, and the over-

all  impact  such  a  performance

would have on the scene.

Bagpipes:  A  set  of  bagpipes  consists

of  a  cloth  or  skin  bag   tted  with  three

reeded pipes (drones), plus a blowpipe and

a chanter (melody pipe). The piper in ates

the  bag  through  the  blowpipe,  then  squeezes  the  air

out through the other four pipes to produce the sound.

Fingerholes  in  the  chanter  allow  it  to  produce  a  wide

range  of  notes.  Meanwhile,  each  of  the  drones  emits

42

a  single,  low-pitched,  buzzing  tone.  Together,  these

provide harmony for the chanters tune. A few societies

prize bagpipes for their distinctive qualities, though their

music is de nitely an acquired taste. The instrument is

very strenuous to play because the piper must keep the

bag supplied with enough air to  ll all four pipes at once.

Therefore,  a  musician  who  can  play  long  pieces  on  it

wins the grudging respect of his or her fellows, whatever

their feelings toward bagpipes in the abstract.

Bardic Music: The musician can produce an unearthly

wail that imposes a -1 morale penalty on the listeners

saving throws against fear effects. This is a supernatural,

mind-affecting ability.

Banjolele:  This  instrument  has  a  tambourinelike,

circular  body  with  vellum  stretched  tightly  across  it

to  act  as  a  sounding  board.  Five  metal  strings  span

the  body  of  the  instrument,  secured  by  pegs  at  the

end  of  the  long,  straight  neck.  A  typical  banjolele  is

about 18 inches in length. A favorite of hal ing bards,

this instrument is otherwise rare. Some  nd its music

jaunty and uplifting; others maintain that it combines

all the worst characteristics of a banjo and a ukulele.

Bardic  Music:  When  played  to  inspire  courage,  this

cheerful  instrument  increases  the  morale  bonus  on

saving  throws  against  fear  effects  from  +2  to  +3  for

listeners allied with the musician.

Bell,  Hanging:  A  hanging  bell  is  a  larger-scale

version  of  a  handbell  (see  below).  Hanging  bells  are

usually  made  of  bronze  or  some  other  metal,  though

stone versions are also known. They have no handles;

instead,  they  hang  from  pivots  mounted  on  frames.

Hanging bells are quite large (up to several feet high)

and  often  weigh  more  than  a  ton  each.  The  typical

hanging bell has a metal rod called a clapper suspended

within it. The performer usually plays a hanging bell by

swinging or tugging on a rope attached to the clapper

rather than by moving the bell itself. The rare hanging

bell  that  has  no  clapper  can  be  played  by  striking

the  outside  with  a  mallet.  Each  of  these  instruments

produces  only  one  notethe  larger  the  bell,  the

lower its pitch. The sound of a hanging bell can carry

for  miles,  especially  when  it  is  mounted  high  in  a

bell tower. Thus, this instrument can be used to raise

an  alarm,  pass  along  signals,  mark  special  occasions,

denote speci c time periods (the hours of the day, the

changing of the guard, the time to pray, and so forth),

or simply make a joyous noise.

Bardic  Music:  When  played  to  inspire  courage,  a

hanging  bell  weighing  at  least  1  ton  increases  the

morale  bonus  on  allies  saves  against  fear  and  charm

effects  from+2  to  +3.  The  music  also  imposes  a  -1

morale  penalty  on  foes  saves  against  those  same

effects.

Bones: Despite their name, these percussion instru-

ments are actually small wooden blocks, typically dark-

colored and highly polished. A complete set consists of

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

twelve  to  thirty  pieces,  all  different  lengths.  Each  is

tapered  in  the  middle  for  easy  insertion  between  the

 ngers.  When  struck,  each  bone  gives  off  a  hollow,

reverberating sound at a particular pitch.

The  bones  are  played  by  striking  pairs  of  pieces

together in succession, thus creating combinations of

tones. A dexterous performer can achieve a wide range

of  effects  by  varying  which  pieces  connect  and  how

long each vibrates, as well as how hard and how often

they hit.

Kobolds  in  particular  love  this  form  of  percussion.

In  fact,  it  is  not  uncommon  for  a  kobold  minstrel  to

manipulate two or more pieces in each hand, switching

them  off  with  the  remaining  pieces  at  dazzling

speedalmost as if he were juggling as well as playing.

Audiences  often  admire  the  speed  of  the  performers

hand gestures as much as the music itself.

Bardic Music: The hollow, eerie, rattling of the bones

imposes a -2 morale penalty on listeners saving throws

against fear effects. Creating this effect is a supernatural,

mind-affecting ability.

Clavichord:  The  clavichord,  an  ancestor  of  the

modern piano, borrows the pipe organs keyboard but

substitutes  horizontal  strings  for  its  pipes.  Pressing  a

key  causes  an  attached  metal  piece  to  strike  a  string

or  pair  of  strings  inside  the  instrument,  sounding

the note. A clavichord looks like a  at, rectangular or

oblong  box  about  1  foot  wide  and  a  bit  more  than  3

feet long. The musician typically places it on a table or

similar  at surface for a performance.

Soft  and  silvery  in  tone,  the  clavichord  allows  great

according to the force with which the keys are struck, but

the  instrument  is  never  particularly  loud.  Clavichords

are particularly popular in orchestral arrangements and

as showpieces in the homes of well-to-do merchants.

Bardic  Music:  A  musician  using  a  clavichord  can

Crumhorn: The true crumhorn is a triple-reed instru-

ment  created  by  and  favored  by  treant  musicians,  but

quite unplayable by most humanoids. A true crumhorn is

a straight tube about 6 feet long with six to eight  ngerholes

and a slightly  ared bell. A small wooden cup containing

the  reeds  serves  as  the  mouthpiece.  The  human  version,

about 3 feet long, produces a reedy, nasal sound quite un-

like the majestic timbre of the true crumhorn.

Though treants are the primary players of crumhorns,

dryads are also exceptionally fond of their music. Most

other  forest  denizens   nd  the  crumhorn  melodic  but

Bardic  Music:  A  crumhorn  of  any  type  grants  the  musi-

cian  a  +1  circumstance  bonus  on  all  Perform  checks

when  the  listeners  are  sylvan  folk  other  than  dryads.

Every  such  listener  also  incurs  a  -4  circumstance

penalty on saving throws made to resist the performers

fascinate or suggestion effects. These modi ers double for

dryad listeners. Producing the saving throw penalty is a

supernatural, mind affecting ability.

Drum:  Possibly  the  oldest  of  all  instruments,  the

drum exists in types without number. Drums range from

simple hollow trees pounded with sticks to a celebrated

magic lake named Irontick, which a musician can play

by jumping up and down on its rigid surface.

A  typical  drum  consists  of  skin,  parchment,  or

somesimilar  material  stretched  tightly  over  the

opening  of  a  hollow  wooden  cylinder  or  pot.  This

covered opening is called the drumhead. Some drums

have  only  one  drumhead;  others  have  two  or  more.

Striking the drumhead with sticks, mallets, or even the

hands produces the sound.

Drums  are  popular  with  almost  every  race  and

culture for their ability to stir the emotions, establish a

background beat for dancing, and provide counterpoint

for a melody produced by some other instrument. The

rare exceptions include celestials, who consider drum

rhythms primitive, and elves, who  nd them vaguely

disturbing  and  extremely  annoying  (a  prejudice

reinforced,  perhaps,  by  the  enthusiasm  with  which

many  of  their  enemies  embrace  them).  Half-orcs,

lizardfolk, troglodytes, trolls, ogres, and the more dim-

witted giants are the races most likely to enjoy simple

drum  music.  Demons,  of  course,  love  an  unholy  din,

so  they  not  only  enjoy  drums  but  also  prefer  to  play

several different kinds at once.

Bardic Music: When played to inspire courage, drums

boost  the  morale  bonus  on  saves  against  fear  effects

from +2 to +4, but decrease the morale bonus on saves

against charm effects from +2 to +0.

Drums, Bongo: These small drums always come in

sets of two. One drum of each pair is about 5 inches in

diameter; the other is about 7 inches. The bongo player

can  either  set  the  drums  down  to  play  them  or  carry

them on a strap. Bongos are played by rapidly tapping

the  drumheads  with  the   ngertips,  and  a  skilled

drummer can create very complex rhythms by rapidly

switching between the two drums.

Goblins  are  quite  fond  of  the  bongos,  which  they

play for entertainment, to call together war parties, and

to  transmit  messages  through  complex  rhythms.  All

these applications tend to sound the same to members

of other races.

Bardic Music: See drum.

Drums,  Kettle:  Also  called  timpani,  kettle  drums

are  large,  heavy,  metal  pots  2-3  feet  high  with  skin

or  parchment  drumheads.  The  drummer  plays  them

by  pounding  on  the  drumheads  with  special  mallets

swathed in cloth. Kettle drums come in sets of at least

two and sometimes up to  ve individual drums, each

a  different  size  and  pitch  (the  larger  the  drum,  the

deeper its tone). Because of their weight, kettle drums

are not portable.

By striking multiple drums in rapid succession, the

drummer  can  produce  a  rapid,  multitone  sound  that

reverberates for several moments. This effect combined

with  a  mounting  crescendo  provides  a  rousing   nale

for any musical performance.

Kettle  drums  are  quite  popular  among  gnolls,  who

have  developed  highly  sophisticated  rhythms  with

them.  Most  gnoll  timpani  concerts  end  with  the

audience rushing to attack any convenient targets.

Bardic Music: See drum.

Dulcimer, Hammered: This instrument has a  at,

trapezoidal  soundbox  with  several  pairs  of  strings

stretched  horizontally  across  it.  Because  of  its  size

(about  30  inches  by  18  inches),  it  is  usually  set  on

a  stand  at  an  angle  rather  than  held  on  the  lap.  The

musician  plays  this  unusual  instrument  by  striking

the strings in rapid succession with tiny hammers, one

held in each hand.

Bardic Music: See zither, below.

Fiddle: An ancestor of the modern violin, the  ddle

is  a  small,  portable,  stringed  instrument  with  a  body

shaped  rather  like  an  hourglass.  Four  or   ve  strings

made of gut or sinew stretch across the body, anchored

by  pegs  at  the  end  of  a  long,  thin  neck.  A  separate

piece,  called  the  bow,  is  a  long,  thin  piece  of  wood

strung with  ne strands of animal hair. Fiddles vary in

length  between  2  feet  (for  Medium-size   ddlers)  and

18  inches  (for  Small   ddlers).  To  play  the   ddle,  the

musician holds it horizontally, typically with the base

tucked under his or her chin, and draws the bow back

and forth across the strings.

The  ddle is popular among bards who prefer lively

dance  music  (reels  or  jigs)  over  serene  but  detached

pure music. Though it is welcome almost anywhere,

the  ddle is the favorite instrument of kobolds, whose

clever  hands  mastered  its   ngerings  ages  ago.  (They

insist  that  they  invented  the   ddle,  but  other  races

 nd that claim dubious.) Kobold minstrels and hal ing

bards  typically  caper  about  while  playing,  showing

their audience an example of the lively dancing their

music encourages. Musicians of other races usually sit

or stand to play the  ddle.

Bardic  Music:  Like  the  other  two  prime  bardic

instruments,  the  lute  and  the  lap-harp,  the   ddle

enables the performer to maintain one bardic music or

virtuoso  performance  effect  while  initiating  another.

Thus,  a  bard  could  maintain  a  countersong  effect  on

one listener while inspiring courage in others.

Flute:  The   ute  is  the  highest  pitched  of  all  the

woodwinds.  Unlike  the  recorder- ute,  from  which

it  derives,  the   ute  is  held  at  a  right  angle  to  the

musicians mouth, so that air blown into it bends to the

side.  Flutes  range  from  8  inches  to  about  2  feet  long.

The  shortest  type  is  often  called  a  piccolo.  Each   ute

has six holes (or, more rarely, eight), plus a thumbhole

44

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

that,  when  covered,  lowers  each  of  the  other  notes

by  an  octave.  Flutes  have  a  reputation  for  producing

gentle,  idyllic  music,  but  they  can  also  create  more

martial  effects  or  distorted  wailing  sounds.  Abyssal

 utes always have an odd number of  ngerholes, and

they  conform  to  no  scale  or  key  used  by  humanoid

bards.  Particularly  in  the  hands  of  demon  pipers,

they produce music that sounds to mortal ears like a

disharmonic combination of sharps,  ats, and bizarre,

minor-key effects.

Bardic Music: See recorder- ute, below.

Gong: A gong is a large, gently curved plate, rather

like a single, huge cymbal. The typical version is made

of bronze and has a distinct, curved-in rim and a boss,

or  slightly  raised  knob,  in  the  center.  Gongs  usually

hang  suspended  from  wooden  frames  to  ensure  that

they  can  reverberate  freely.  Both  the  frames  and

the  gongs  themselves  can  be  as  simple  or  as  highly

decorated as desired.

The sound of a gong never fails to get attention. To

play  it,  the  musician  simply  strikes  the  boss  with  a

large mallet, which is usually covered with either felt

or cloth. Each gong can produce only a single note, but

it is audible to a considerable distance and reverberates

for  5  rounds  after  each  strike.  So  impressive  is  the

sound that enthusiasts claim no other instrument can

match it.

Stationary  gongs  usually  weigh  several  hundred

pounds each, so they are not suitable for adventuring.

However, they are quite popular for ceremonial music

and  as  warning  signal  devices.  Primitive  races  often

hang  circular  metal  shields  on  their  walls  to  serve  as

makeshift alarm gongs

Bardic  Music:  While  it  reverberates,  the  gong  adds

+5 to the DC for each Concentration check made by a

listener (including the performer). Creating this effect

is a supernatural, sonic ability. When played as part of

a  countersong  attempt,  the  gong  gives  the  user  a  +5

circumstance  bonus  on  the  Perform  check  required

for that effect.

Handbell:  The  handbell  is  a  hollow,  beehive-

shaped instrument with a clapper inside and a handle

at  the  top.  Handbells  are  usually  cast  from  bronze  or

some other sturdy metal. A handbell is small enough

(typically 2-12 inches long) to be used in one hand. To

play  one,  the  performer  need  only  swing  it  back  and

forth, causing the clapper to strike the sides repeatedly.

Each  handbell  produces  a  single,  ringing  notethe

larger the bell, the deeper its tone.

Handbells are usually grouped together for musical

performances.  When  played  in  speci c  sequences  by

experts, they can produce highly complex chords and

melodies.  Humans,  elves,  and  celestials  are  especially

fond of handbell music.

A  magic  handbell  can  be  played  only  if  it  has  the

correct clapper, which may or may not be present upon

its discovery.

Bardic  Music:  A  handbell  grants  the  performer  a

+1  circumstance  bonus  on  Perform  checks  made  for

countersong  attempts.  Additional  handbells  do  not

increase this bonus.

Harmonica:  A  later  re nement  on  pan  pipes  (see

below),  the  harmonica  substitutes  metal  tubes  for

the  reeds  and  encloses  them  in  a  small,  rectangular

casing.  The  musician  simply  blows  into  the  top  of

the harmonica at various points to produce a range of

notes. This instruments high, buzzing sound is popular

among some hal ings and gnomes.

Bardic Music: Harmonica music warms the hearts of

commoners and other folk of humble station. Thus, a

successful Perform check in such company grants the

musician a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,

Disguise, and Gather Information checks involving any

of those listeners for 1d6 hours after the performance

ends. In addition, it shifts the attitude of the listeners

by one category in the performers favor (for example,

from  friendly  to  helpfulsee  the  NPC  Attitudes

section in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

However, it also imposes a -4 circumstance penalty on

Intimidate checks made against such listeners for the

same period. Producing these effects is a supernatural,

mind-affecting ability.

Harp:  Far  less  portable  than  its  smaller  cousin  the

lapharp,  a  standing  harp  is  often  5  or  even  6  feet  in

height. Its forty-six strings give it an astonishing range

of more than  ve octaves. An optional pedal attachment

allows the musician to raise (sharpen) or lower ( atten)

the notes, thus generating an even wider range.

Despite their size, harps are rather delicate and easily

damaged.  This  tends  to  restrict  harp  performances

to  indoor  settings,  typically  theaters  or  residences  of

aristocrats rich enough to own these instruments.

Connoisseurs  of  harp  music  maintain  that  it  is

even  more  ethereal  and  elegant  than  the  music  of  a

lap-harp,  although  champions  of  the  latter  hold  their

instruments to be richer in tone. Harps are particularly

popular  among  celestials  and  elves,  but  humans  also

 nd their music pleasing.

Bardic  Music:  By  playing  the  harp,  the  musician

can impose a -2 morale penalty on the listeners saves

against  charm  effects.  This  is  a  supernatural,  mind-

affecting ability.

Harpsichord:  Though  it  features  one  or  more

keyboards,  the  harpsichord  is  essentially  an  enclosed

harp. Pressing the keys causes the instruments internal

mechanism  to  pluck  the  strings  rather  than  strike

them, as the clavichord does. The harpsichords music

is  louder  than  that  of  a  clavichord,  but  the  musician

cannot control the volume.

The  harpsichord  has  a  delicate  sound  esteemed  by

some as waterlike and derided by others as tinkly. Like

the  pipe  organ,  it  is  a  stationary,  indoor  instrument.

Thus, it is usually found only in great cities or in the

homes of music-loving nobles.

45

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Bardic Music: A performer using the harpsichord can

maintain  only  a  single  bardic  music  or  virtuoso  per-

formance effect at a time. In lieu of a standard bardic

music  effect,  however,  the  musician  can  impose  a  -1

circumstance  penalty  on  saves  against  charm  effects

and  a  -  2  circumstance  penalty  on  saves  to  resist  the

sleep spell for nonallied listeners. This is a supernatural,

mind-affecting ability.

Hautbois: A softer-toned variant of the shawm (see

below), the hautbois has extra  ngerholes (a total of ten

or more), keys, and sometimes a cupped bell at the end.

The  keys  increase  the  number  of  possible   ngering

combinations,  and  the  bell-shaped  end  gives  the  in-

strument a softer, more resonant sound than its cousin

the shawm. A hautbois uses narrower reeds than does

a shawm.

Bardic Music: See shawm, below.

Horn, Natural: Originally these horns were, as the

name indicates, actual horns taken from bulls or more

exotic  beasts.  A  natural  horn  consists  of  a  narrow  tip

connected to a wider, circular ori ce by a hollow, often

curved shaft.

The musician plays a natural horn by simply blowing

into the small end. Unless the instrument has  ngerholes

in the shaft, however, it can produce only a single note.

Natural  horns  come  in  all  sizes,  but  those  used  by

Medium-size creatures are typically 1-2 feet in length.

Larger  humanoids  favor  dire  horns,  which  are  made

from  the  horns  of  dire  creatures.  Legend  holds  that

minotaurs  use  horns  made  from  the  severed  horns

of  their  own  kind  who  suffered  defeat  in  one-on-one

contests of honor.

Most  magic  horns  of  this  type  are  made  from  the

horns of unnatural creatures, such as demons or devils.

An old legend relates that several members of a noted

bardic college once sought to make a magic horn out of

one  shed  by  the  dreaded  tarrasque.  Though  they  suc-

ceeded, they quickly discovered that playing it attract-

ed the attention of the creature itself, which promptly

destroyed horn and bards alike.

Natural horns are popular in primitive societies of all

kinds.  Hobgoblins  and  orcs  in  particular  enjoy  these

instruments for their loud, stirring, martial sound.

Bardic Music: When played to inspire courage, a natu-

ral horn raises the morale bonus on attacks and weapon

damage  from  +1  to  +2.  The  morale  bonus  on  saves

against charm effects, however, drops from +2 to +0.

Horn, Shell: This instrument is typically made from

a conch shell. When winded, it gives off a distinctive

groan that can vary only in volume, not in pitch.

A  shell  horn  makes  an  excellent  signal  device

particularly  underwater,  since  sound  travels  much

faster in water than in air. Some aquatic races such as

merfolk and kuo-toa collect a variety of such shells in

different sizes and play them in harmony, in sequence,

or  both.  The  music  of  these  seashell  orchestras  can

achieve a deep, haunting grandeur.

Bardic Music: Shell horns produce the same effects as

natural horns do (see above), but only when the listen-

ers are aquatic or marine creatures.

Lap-Harp: A lap-harp typically has seventeen strings;

there can be as few as twelve on a smaller instrument or

as many as twenty-four on a larger one. Silver wires are

the most common choice for strings, and other materi-

als  are  occasionally  used.  Lap-harps  are  usually  made

of wood, though some artisans carve them from bone

or  ivory.  Whatever  their  material,  most  lap-harps  are

highly  polished  and  elaborately  decorated  with  carv-

ings. The  nest rank as works of art in their own right,

quite apart from their status as instruments. Most are

between 2 and 3 feet in height and half as wide as they

are tall.

Second only to the lute in popularity, the lap-harp is

especially favored by elven bards for its light, soothing

sound  and  gentle,  rippling  notes.  Elven  lap-harps  are

often handed down from generation to generation, and

many  eventually  acquire  names  and  legends  of  their

own. Any character with the bardic knowledge ability

who examines an elven lap-harp automatically gains a

+5 bonus on his or her bardic knowledge check to iden-

tify the instrument and its bearers.

Bardic  Music:  One  of  the  three  prime  bardic  instru-

ments, along with the lute and the  ddle, the lap-harp

enables  a  performer  to  maintain  one  bardic  music  or

virtuosos performance effect while initiating another.

Thus,  a  bard  could  maintain  a  fascinate  effect  on  one

listener while inspiring courage in another.

Lur: This large horn is about 8 feet long and weighs

approximately 50 pounds. It is curved rather like a mam-

moths tusk and culminates in a  at, bronze disk some

3 feet across. An engraving of a monstrous face usually

adorns this disk. Lurs come in pairs, each pair consisting

of one right-handed and one left-handed instrument.

The  lur  is  a  favorite  instrument  of  those  few  giants

who  take  music  seriouslyprimarily  cloud  giants  and

storm  giants.  Since  lurs  produce  music  that  is  at  once

solemn, grand, and melancholy, they are often played on

ceremonial occasions.

Bardic  Music:  When  played  to  inspire  courage,  the

lur  raises  the  morale  bonuses  on  attack  and  weapon

damage from +1 to +2 for all giant listeners allied with

the performer.

Lute:  This  ancestor  of  the  guitar  has  a  pear-shaped

bowl and a distinctive bent neck with frets for  ngering.

Between four and eight strings stretch between the base

of the bowl and the top of the neck. Lutes vary between

30  and  36  inches  in  length,  with  the  bowl  taking  up

some two-thirds of that total. The musician either strums

or plucks the strings to produce music.

A  highly  versatile  instrument  because  of  its  wide

range of notes and in ection, the lute is accessible to

the beginner but capable of great subtlety in the hands

of a master. The deep bowl gives it a rich, full sound un-

like that of any other stringed instrument. It is by far the

46

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

most popular instrument with hards, especially half-elf

and human ones.

Bardic  Music:  The  most  popular  of  the  three  prime

bardic  instruments,  the  lute  enables  a  performer  to

maintain one bardic music or virtuoso performance ef-

fect while initiating another. Thus, a bard could maintain

inspire competence on one listener while using suggestion

on another.

Lyre: A simpler ancestor of the lap-harp, a lyre typical-

ly has a body made out of a turtle shell, plus two curved

arms and a crossbar to hold its four to six (or more rarely,

eight) gut or sinew strings taut. To play the lyre, the mu-

sician holds it in one hand while strumming or plucking

the strings with the other.

The very simplicity of a lyre is its charm, since even a

novice can strum one to credible effect. Because of this

and the fact that theyre easy to make, lyres are popular

among the sylvan fey (especially satyrs) and countryfolk

in general. On occasion, however, a true master (such as

the legendary Orpheus) adopts it as a signature instru-

ment, producing astonishing effects.

Bardic Music: While playing a lyre, the musician gains

a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks for counter-

song, fascinate, or suggestion attempts when the listeners

are fey.

Mandolin: Essentially a smaller version of the lute, a

mandolin is usually between 20 inches and 2 feet long.

It has a straighter neck than does the lutethe end at

which the pegs secure the strings tilts back only slightly,

if  at  all.  The  mandolin  is  unusual  for  the  number  of

strings it holdsfrom four to six pairs (eight to twelve

strings  total)  or  even  more.  A  mandolin  is  typically

played with a pick, both to protect the musicians  ngers

and because the strings are too close together to pluck

accurately by hand.

The mandolin has a sweeter sound than the lute and,

because of its shorter strings, a higher pitch as well. Its

great range of tone and expression have made it a favor-

ite of Small bards, especially gnomes and hal ings, who

champion it as superior even to the lute.

Bardic Music: See lute, above.

Organ, Pipe: Huge, heavy, and always stationary, the

pipe  organ  is  the  most  complex  of  all  musical  instru-

ments.  Each  has  hundreds  of  pipes,  ranging  from  as

short as 1 inch to as long as 32 feet. Most of these pipes

are vertical metal tubes, but a few upright wooden shafts

(typically square rather than circular) provide additional

tonal  depth.  A  great  bellows  pushes  air  through  the

pipes to produce the sound. A typical organ has two to

 ve keyboards (one for the feet and one or more for the

hands), each of which can be set to sound like a different

instrument  or  combination  of  instruments.  A  panel  of

knobs (called stops) controls which pipes soundpull-

ing a knob into the open position allows the forced air

from the bellows to enter a particular pipe or set of pipes

when the correct key is depressed.

To  play  a  pipe  organ,  the  performer  sets  the  stops

to  direct  air  into  the  desired  pipes,  then  depresses

combinations of keys to generate the sound. The pipes

must be continuously supplied with air throughout the

acter  while  still  maintaining  both  of  the  other  two

effects.  Failure  at  either  Concentration  check  ends

one earlier effect (the one that has been operating the

longest) because of the performers distraction.

Pipes, Pan: A set of pan pipes is a series of hollow

reeds  or  wooden  tubes  of  varying  lengths  bound  to-

gether in a row, from smallest to largest. To play them,

the musician blows into the tops of the tubes, produc-

ing  a  sound  much  like  that  of  several  tiny  wooden

 utes. By moving the pipes from side to side, the piper

can  play  different  notes.  Switching  rapidly  among

notes  creates  the  sweet,  rippling  effect  for  which  the

instrument is known.

Simple yet evocative, pan pipes are favorites of satyrs

and other sylvan fey. Humans and some elves also  nd

their music pleasing.

Bardic  Music:  Pan  pipes  grant  the  musician  a  +1

circumstance  bonus  on  all  Perform  checks  when  the

listeners are animals or fey.

Psaltery: The psaltery looks like a zither (see below)

without  its  fretted   ngerboard.  It  has  only  one  set  of

strings,  and  its  music  is  similar  to  that  of  a  harp.  A

psaltery is played by plucking the strings with  ngers,

quills, or tiny hooks.

Celestials are particularly fond of psaltery music. Hu-

mans and some elves also  nd it spiritually uplifting.

Bardic Music: See zither, below.

Recorder-Flute:  This  ancient  instrument  origi-

nated as a simple, hollow tube that produced a single

resonant  note  when  air  was  blown  through  it.  The

addition of six to eight  ngerholes enabled the musi-

cian to vary the tone, and an optional thumbhole near

the upper opening made it possible to lower the notes

by an octave. These alterations resulted in the instru-

ment called the recorder- ute. Recorder- utes come

in  many  sizes,  but  the  most  common  lengths  are  12

inches  (for  Small  musicians)  and  18  inches  (for  Me-

dium-size musicians).

The fact that recorder- utes are very simple to play

and  relatively  easy  to  construct  makes  them  popular

among those who cannot afford or master more com-

plex  instruments.  Some  bards  have  found  this  very

simplicity  a  bene tthey  claim  that  recorder- utes

soothe an audience and enhance the performers ability

to  cast  enchantment  spells  such  as  sleep,  charm  person,

and the like successfully.

Bardic Music: By playing a recorder- ute, the musician

can impose a -1 circumstance penalty on listeners saving

throws against charm and compulsion effects, including

the bardic music effects fascinate and suggestion. This is a

supernatural, mind-affecting ability.

performance.  A  musician  playing  a  small  pipe  organ

can  feed  the  instrument  personally  by  working  the

bellows with a foot pump. Playing a large organ, how-

ever, usually requires at least one assistant to pump the

bellows. The volume depends solely on the amount of

air entering the pipes, so all notes sound equally loud

or soft.

The  pipe  organ  represents  the  pinnacle  of  instru-

ment-crafting  technology.  Its  huge  array  of  different-

sized  pipes  gives  it  a  truly  incredible  range  of  sound.

The  smaller  the  pipe,  the  higher-pitched  the  sound  it

produces and, conversely, the larger the pipe, the lower

its pitch. Occasionally, an organs complement of pipes

includes a few so large that their notes are beyond the

lower  limit  of  human  hearing  (although  they  can  still

help to create subsonic effects) or so tiny that only ani-

mals  can  hear  their  sounds.  The  keyboards  permit  the

musician to create full, multinote chords by striking two

or more keys simultaneously.

Human  societies  in  particular  prize  the  sound  of

the pipe organ and its relatives, the clavichord and the

harpsichord (see above). Because of their size, expense,

and immobility, pipe organs are typically found only in

cathedrals and palaces.

Bardic  Music:  Because  of  its  multiple  keyboards,  a

pipe  organ  enables  the  musician  to  maintain  up  to

three bardic music or virtuosos performance effects

at once. For example, a performing bard could begin

by  inspiring  courage.  Then,  with  a  successful  Con-

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Shawm: This double-reed precursor to the oboe looks

a bit like an inverted scepter. Some shawms are highly

decorated,  which  increases  their  resemblance  to  scep-

ters even more. The typical shawm measures about 26-28

inches in length and has seven or eight  ngerholes.

Shawms were developed for open-air performances;

thus  their  music  tends  to  be  very  loud.  Many  aristo-

cratic  amateur  musicians  have  adopted  the  shawm  as

their instrument of choice, since it is not only attractive

to the eye, but also quite distinctive in sound. Treants

adore the sound of any sort of shawm, though they are

most partial to the crumhorn (see above)

Bardic Music: A shawm bestows a certain prestige on

anyone  who  can  play  it  properly.  Thus,  a  successful

Perform  check  made  in  an  aristocratic  setting  grants

the performer a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplo-

macy, Disguise, and Gather Information checks made

against  listeners  for  1d6  hours  after  the  performance

ends. It also shifts the attitude of such listeners by one

category in the performers favor (for example, from in-

different to friendlysee the NPC Attitudes section in

Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). However,

it also imposes a -4 circumstance penalty on Intimidate

checks against those listeners for the same period. Cre-

ating the above effects is a supernatural, mindaffecting

ability.

Tabor: This small instrument has a diameter of about

1 foot, a thickness of up to 2 feet, and a drumhead on

each end. The tabor is light enough to wear on a ban-

doleer, belt, or sash draped around the drummers neck.

Perfect  for  martial  music  and  for  setting  marching

rhythms, this instrument gets its distinctive rattle from

the  bands  of  gut  strung  along  its  lower  head,  which

vibrate when the upper head is struck.

Dwarves in particular enjoy the music of the tabor,

with  its  strong  martial  sound.  Not  only  do  they  play

it  for  entertainment,  they  also  use  it  to  keep  cadence

while marching to war.

Bardic Music: See drum, above.

Trumpet,  Heralds:  In  time,  natural  horns  gave

way to metal horns made of gold, silver, bronze, brass,

and occasionally even more exotic metals. These metal

trumpets quickly became popular in human and a few

humanoid  societies,  primarily  because  they  could  be

made to speci c sizes and shapes.

A  heralds  trumpet  looks  like  a  straight  tube  made

of  brass  or  bronze  that   ares  out  into  a  bell  shape  at

the end. It is among the loudest instruments available

because its volume is limited only by the windpower of

the performer. The typical heralds trumpet is 3-5 feet

long and depends on the musicians tongue and breath

to produce variations in tone. A more complex version

has three or more  ngerholes on the shaft. By covering

these in different combinations, the musician can play

different notes on the same horn.

Since heralds trumpets produce very clear, very loud

notes, they are popular among humans and humanoid

races for sending signals, raising alarms, and motivat-

ing troops. Musicians who play complex versions with

 ngerholes can produce exceptionally beautiful melo-

dies. Devils are also very fond of trumpetsthe louder

and more discordant the sound, the better.

Bardic Music: See horn, natural (above).

Water-Pipe:  The  water-pipe,  or  hookah,  is  widely

known among some human cultures, but its properties

as  a  musical  instrument  were  developed  at  the  behest

of a bronze dragon who wanted an instrument he could

play  without  assuming  anthropomorphic  form.  Many

other  dragons  have  since  adopted  this  unusual  instru-

ment as their own.

Like  a  smoking  hookah,  the  musical  water-pipe

works by  ltering smoke through water held in a large,

vaselike vessel. Instead of cooling the smoke for inha-

lation,  however,  the  instrument  version  uses  various

special additions to enhance the sound of the bubbling

water. Some water-pipes contain tiny crystal beads that

tinkle against the sides of the vessel each time a puff of

smoke stirs the water. Others have chimes or even tiny

cymbals  hung  inside,  which  strike  one  another  and

ring softly whenever air moves within the vessel.

Dragons  have  seemingly  boundless  enthusiasm  for

the  water-pipe  and  its  music.  In  fact,  dragon  musi-

cians  sometimes  spend  years  contemplating  possible

improvements and re nements. Most humanoids  nd

water-pipe  music  soothing,  but  not  particularly  inter-

esting.  Occasionally,  however,  a  humanoid  sorcerer

or a kobold takes up the water-pipe to stress his or her

af nity with dragons.

Bardic  Music:  When  played  to  inspire  courage,  the

water-pipe  raises  the  morale  bonus  on  saving  throws

against fear effects from +2 to +4 for the performers al-

lies. However, it also reduces the bonus on saving throws

against charm effects from +2 to +0 for all such listeners.

Because the music of this instrument is so soft, it affects

only targets within 30 feet.

Whistle-Pipe:  Neither  a  horn  nor  a   ute,  the  whis-

tlepipe  is  made  of  metal  but  played  like  a  woodwind.

It consists of a straight metal tube studded with  nger-

holes. The musician plays it by blowing directly through

the length of the pipe while covering combinations of

holes  to  produce  different  notes.  A  whistle-pipe  is  a

small  instrument,  typically  about  1  foot  in  length  and

only an inch in diameter.

The whistle-pipe produces a high-pitched sound that

some consider quite piercing. Gnomes particularly en-

joy its music, however, and many gnome bards adopt it

as their instrument of choice.

Bardic Music: A whistle-pipe grants the musician a +5

circumstance  bonus  on  Perform  checks  for  counter-

song attempts.

Zither: A zither looks like a  attened lute with its neck

snapped off and glued into a new position along the left

side  of  the  instrument.  It  has  a   at  soundboxusually

rectangular, though other shapes are known. The zither

49

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

has  two  sets  of  gut  or  metal  stringsone  stretched

across  the  soundbox  and  the  other  along  the  fretted

 ngerboard at the side.

A zither is usually either held on the lap or laid  at on

a table. To play it, the musician uses a pick mounted on a

thumb ring to pluck a melody on the  ngerboard strings

while strumming the other set of strings (often with a

quill or small stick) to provide background harmony.

The zither is popular with humans and gnomes. Its

light,  lilting  tones  and  the  intricacy  of  melodies  that

its two sets of strings can produce make it a favorite of

some bards as well.

Bardic Music: When played to inspire courage, a zither

boosts the morale bonus on saves to resist charm and fear

effects from +2 to +3. However, it also reduces the morale

bonus on weapon damage rolls from +1 to +0.

Self-Played Instruments

Self-Played Instruments

Once  set  in  place,  self-played  instruments  need  no

further

interventionthey  simply  make  music

whenever  the  conditions  are  right.  This  makes  them

very  good  triggers  for  certain  magical  effects.  When

the  condition  that  causes  the  instrument  to  play

occurs, the music activates the spell effect.

Magical  versions  of  the  preceding  instruments

might also have the ability to play themselves. These,

however, are magically enhanced normal instruments,

not classes of instruments speci cally created for that

purpose.

Chimes,  Wind:  Wind  chimes  can  be  made  of

wood,  metal,  or  crystal.  The  simplest  type  consists

of  strips  of  the  chosen  material,  all  the  same  length,

hanging parallel to one another from a support. A more

complex type uses strips of different lengths, but they

still hang parallel about one-half inch apart. The most

sophisticated of all wind chimes, the chromatic chime,

consists of actual tubular bells, each tuned to a different

note  and  carefully  arranged  to  create  a  harmonious

scale. Individual chimes of any type can be as short as a

few inches or as long as 8 feet.

Wind  chimes  are  hung  in  a  place  where  the  wind

can easily reach them. When a strong enough breeze

blows,  the  pieces  knock  together  and  chime.  If  all

the  pieces  are  the  same  length,  the  instrument  can

sound  only  one  note,  though  its  rhythm  is  random.

Wind chimes with pieces of different lengths produce

different notes, depending upon exactly which pairs of

chimes come into contact.

The most common type of magic wind chimes grants

a +1 morale bonus on listeners saving throws against

charm and fear effects for as long as it sounds.

Harp,  Aeolian:  Although  it  looks  more  like  a

dulcimer  than  a  harp,  the  aeolian  harp  (sometimes

called a wind harp) sounds very similar to a true harp.

A typical Aeolian harp is 3 feet long but only about 5

inches wide and 2 inches thick. Its ten to twelve strings

are all the same length, though they vary in thickness.

An  aeolian  harp  is  usually  hung  outdoors.  When

the  wind  blows  over  it,  the  changing  air  pressure

causes  oneor  more  of  the  strings  to  quiver,  starting

with  the  thinnest  and  lightest.  This  produces  a  tone

just as though a musician had plucked the string. The

50

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

more notes sound. The music of the harp continues for

as long as the wind does.

Some   nd  the  music  of  an  aeolian  harp  eerie;  oth-

ers consider it ethereal. It is popular among elves and

humans.

Many  a  bard  has  created  a  magic  aeolian  harp  that

produces a countersong effect, which lasts for as long

as the music does. Such an instrument functions as a

bard  with  the  same  bard  level  and  the  same  Perform

skill modi er as its creator had when he made it.

Stones, Wind: Naturally occurring stones sometimes

have holes, grooves, or ridges through which the wind

whistles or moans when it blows strongly enough from

the right direction. It was only a matter of time before

intelligent creatures decided to imitate and, if possible,

improve upon nature. Wind stone is a general term for

the result of such experimentationa rock outcropping

that has been bored, altered, or placed in such a way as to

create music when the wind blows. Each wind stone has

a single distinctive whisper, wail, or groan that lasts from

a few seconds to several minutes.

The sound of a wind stone is often disquieting to hu-

man or hal ing listeners, though dwarves and gnomes

 nd it pleasant enough. Other races tend to either ig-

nore these sounds altogether or imagine them to be the

voices of invisible creatures that must be appeased with

periodic sacri ces.

Occasionally, a bard creates a magic wind stone that

imposes a -4 morale penalty on listeners saving throws

against fear effects while it sounds and for 1d6 minutes

thereafter. The creator is immune to this effect.

WEAPONS

This  section  details  unusual  mundane  weapons  that

bards, rogues, and assassins  nd especially useful.

New Weapons

New Weapons

Some uncommon weapons lend themselves particularly

well to the battle strategies that rogues and bards prefer.

This section lists a few such items that DMs may wish to

make available in their campaigns.

Bayonet: Sometimes a bard  nds himself in a situa-

tion that requires self-defense at a few seconds notice.

Thats when an instrument-mounted bayonet comes in

handy.

A  bayonet  (a  long,  thin  dagger)  af xed  to  the  neck

of a lute or other instrument can be used to fend off an

attacker, or even to in ict respectable damage if set to re-

ceive a charge. However, some risk of damage to the in-

strument exists from the sudden impact (see the Attack

an Object section in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook).

Crossbow,  Covered  Hand:  Rogues  often   nd

themselves  hanging  from  ropes,  clinging  to  walls,  and

in other positions that make normal missile  re impos-

sible.  However,  a  covered  hand  crossbow,  in  which  a

thin  sheet  of  wood  holds  the  bolt  in  its   ring  groove,

can be  red from any position without the bolt slipping

out. This device is very similar to the cut-down repeating

crossbow in appearance, except that it lacks a clip. The

covered  hand  crossbow  loads  from  the  rear  and  holds

only one bolt at a time.

Crossbow, Grapple-Firing: This device helps adven-

tures scale unclimbable walls, bridge chasms, escape down

sheer cliffs, and the like. A grapple- ring crossbow is a

heavy crossbow modi ed to  re a special, grapple-head-

ed metal bolt attached to 100 feet of thin, light rope.

A  successful  shot  at  an  appropriate  target  (see  the

Attack  an  Object  section  in  Chapter  8  of  the  Players

Handbook)  indicates  that  the  grapple  has  hooked  onto

something, anchoring the rope  rmly enough for a char-

acter to ascend it with a successful Climb check (DC 15).

Failure brings one of three results: that the grapple sim-

ply failed to snag anything, that it has lodged but is not

secure  enough  to  support  a  characters  weight,  or  that

theres simply nothing up there for it to catch. In the  rst

case, the user can simply recoil the rope and try again. In

the  second  case,  a  successful  Use  Rope  check  (DC  15)

made before anyone tries to climb reveals the instability.

The user cannot free that grapple but may try to  re an-

other. (Should anyone try to  limb the unstable rope, the

grapple gives way after the climber has progressed 1d10

feet. Determine damage normally for the resulting fall.)

In the third case, retries automatically fail.

A character can easily anchor a grapple-bolt by hand

in a niche or use pitons to secure it on smooth stone.

This  provides  the  same  aid  for  descent  without  the

need to  re the weapon.

Garrote, Cord: This type of garrote is a simple cord

used  to  strangle  an  opponent.  Using  this  weapon  re-

quires a special garrote attack (see Chapter 5). An expe-

rienced strangler can also use scarves, sashes, vines, and

the like as impromptu cord garrotes.

Garrote,  Locking:  This  nasty  variant  of  the  wire

garrote comes with a pair of metal grips, each of which

contains one portion of a locking mechanism. Once the

garrote has begun to deal damage after a garrote attack,

the  attacker  can  link  the  two  ends  and  twist  the  grips

into  their  locked  position.  This  maintains  strangling

pressure  on  the  victim  even  after  the  attacker  lets  go.

The victim continues to make grapple checks (each one

opposed by the last attack roll the attacker made) until

freed or unconscious.

The DC for the Disable Device check to free a victim

from a locked garrote is 10 if the character attempting

the  task  has  Exotic  Weapon  Pro ciency  (locking  gar-

rote), or 25 otherwise. If someone other than the victim

makes the attempt, a -5 circumstance penalty applies to

the check unless the victim is held, unconscious, or oth-

erwise kept from moving. A character attempting to re-

move a locking garrote from his or her own neck suffers

the same penalty on the Disable Device check, this time

for working blind. Naturally, its impossible for any char-

acter to take 10 or take 20 on this check unless the victim

trapped in the device is already dead. Smashing the lock-

ing garrote leaves it frozen in the locked position.

Garrote, Wire: This weapon is nothing but a thin wire

set into a pair of wooden grips. Like the cord version, it

is  used  to  strangle  an  opponent.  The  grips  protect  the

attackers hands from the wire. A character using a wire

garrote without grips or some other form of hand protec-

tion takes 1d3 points of damage per round from the wire.

52

Using this weapon requires a special garrote attack (see

Chapter 5).

Sleeve,  Weighted:  Subtle  weapons  often  used  for

self-defense,  weighted  sleeves  are  usually  found  only

in  lands  where  long,  loose  sleeves  are  fashionable.  A

weighted sleeve consists of one or more metal weights

sewn into a sleeve hem. Tailors who incorporate these

weapons into  nely made garments take care to spread

out the weight so that the clothing hangs normally. In

simpler peasant versions, a small pocket just inside the

cuff of each sleeve holds a single metal ball weighing

about  1  pound.  Typically,  both  of  a  garments  sleeves

are weighted.

To use this weapon, the wearer  rst swings the sleeve

around to build momentum, much as if it were a sling.

Instead of releasing a missile, however, the user simply

clubs the target with the weight. Building up suf cient

momentum  is  a  move-equivalent  action,  so  only  one

blow with each sleeve is normally possible in a round.

Attacking with both sleeves simultaneously incurs the

standard penalties for  ghting with two weapons. The

wielder might also alternate between the left and right

sleeves, striking with one and building up speed with

the  other  during  one  round,  then  striking  with  the

second sleeve and building momentum with the  rst

on the following round. This tactic incurs the standard

penalty for using a weapon in the offhand each round.

Wearing a garment with weighted sleeves as part of a

disguise is a favorite trick of assassins. Once the assassin

has carried out his mission, he can simply discard the

weights in the nearest convenient dustbin or pond and

continue posing as an unarmed servant or guest in the

house, even if a search is conducted.

THIEF GEAR

The  standard  kit  of  thieves  tools  described  in  the

Players  Handbook  contains  all  the  basics  needed  to

disarm  traps,  pick  locks,  and  the  like.  Experienced

rogues,  however,  often   nd  themselves  wishing  for

special tools that would enable them to carry out some

of these same tasks with less personal risk. This section

presents several such tools designed to make a rogues

life  easierand  perhaps  longer.  These  range  from

special thieves tools to useful everyday devices. There

are also a few items speci cally targeted against rogues.

Costs and weights for all these items are given in Table

3-2: Thief Gear.

Automated Footpad: A gnome creation, this device

looks like a small, wind-up toy. When wound and set in

motion, it heads off in a straight line, making distinct,

audible footsteps every few seconds. Its chief purpose

is to distract guards attention by making it seem that

someone is walking down a corridor, though it can also

make a useful trap-detection tool. If the user makes a

successful  Disable  Device  check  (DC  25),  the  device

can set off a touch- or proximity-triggered trap.

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Double-Sided  Clothes:  This  specially  made  set  of

clothing  is  useful  for  allaying  suspicion  and  throwing

off  pursuit.  A  bard  who  has  been  spotted  leaving  an

assignation, a spymaster who is trying to throw off a tail,

or a thief who wants to establish an alibiany of these can

bene t greatly from this relatively simple item.

Each piece of clothing in the set is reversible, and the

two  sides  differ  markedly  in  color,  style,  and  general

appearance. Neither side resembles the other in any way,

and  most  often  the  two  ensembles  even  correspond  to

different social stations. Thus, the wearer can take pains

to  be  seen  wearing  one  out t,  then  duck  brie y  out  of

sight and emerge looking so different that only the most

suspicious observer would connect him or her with the

person  who  vanished  a  few  moments  before.  However,

it would behoove the suits owner not to use it too many

times in the same town, lest some bright citizen make a

connection between the disappearance of one person and

the appearance of the other.

It  takes  2  minutes  to  reverse  the  clothing  and  alter

other  details  (such  as  hairstyle,  jewelry,  and  so  forth)

appropriately.  A  character  who  completes  the  change

gains  the  standard  +5  bonus  on  Disguise  checks  for

alteration  of  minor  details.  If  the  wearer  attempts  any

additional changes (such as using spells or a disguise kit,

or  appearing  as  a  different  gender,  race,  or  class),  apply

the corresponding check modi ers (see the Disguise skill

description  in  Chapter  4  of  the  Players  Handbook)  and

extend the time required appropriately.

Table 32: Thief Gear

Expandable Pole: This sturdy but hollow bamboo rod

is 1 foot long and capped at each end. By removing the

caps, the user can slide out up to  ve additional sections

from each tip. When extended and rotated into locked

position (a move-equivalent action), each of these sections

adds 1 foot to the total length of the rod. Since each end

can  produce  the  same  number  of  extensions,  the  pole

can be set at any 1-foot increment up to 11 feet. The usual

settings are 5 feet, 7 feet, 9 feet, and 11 feet. Collapsing the

pole  back  to  its  original  1-foot  length  requires  twisting

each section to unlock it, then sliding it back inside the

next larger piece (a move-equivalent action).

The primary function of this device is to bridge holes

or gaps and anchor ropes for descent into pits and shafts.

How  far  the  pole  is  extended  determines  how  much

weight it can bear: It can hold 150 pounds at 5 feet, 120

pounds at 7 feet, 100 pounds at 9 feet, or 50 pounds at 11

feet. Hal ings and gnomes in particular  nd this a useful

piece of dungeoneering equipment.

Gorget: This metal collar offers superior protection

for  the  neck,  providing  a  +10  armor  bonus  against

garrote  attacks.  The  typical  gorget  consists  of  two

semicircular metal plates held in place with a metal pin.

It is typically worn as part of a set of full plate, though

it can also be worn alone or as part of a helmet. Adding

spikes  to  a  gorget  doubles  the  cost  and  may  make

certain  opponents  reconsider  attacking  the  wearers

throat, but this feature adds nothing to its armor bonus.

A gorget has a hardness of 10.

Because it can restrict breathing, long-term exertion

is dif cult for the gorget wearer. The item imposes a -4

circumstance penalty on any checks made to perform

physical  actions  that  extend  over  a  period  of  time

(running, swimming, breath-holding, and so on).

Leather  Collar:  This  simple  piece  of  gear  protects

the neck, providing a +4 armor bonus against garrote

attacks. The typical version is between 2 and 4 inches

wide, has a hardness of 3, and is held in place by laces.

Leather collars must be custom-made for their wearers,

and  fashion-conscious  owners  often  have  them

decorated with stitching, studs, or dye.

While less restrictive than the gorget, the leather collar

also makes long periods of exertion dif cult. This item

imposes a -2 circumstance penalty on any checks made

to perform physical actions that extend over a period of

time (running, swimming, breath-holding, and so on).

Longreach  Tongs:  Though  this  versatile  tool  has  a

multitude  of  potential  uses,  rogues  typically  employ  it

for  removing  items  from  shelves,  cabinets,  chests,  or

other  receptacles  without  directly  endangering  their

hands. The tongs do not permit  ne manipulation, but

the owner can use them to lift an object weighing up to

5 pounds, tug aside a curtain, grip a doorknob or latch, or

perform some similar activity. Some sets of tongs have

wooden  handles  to  insulate  the  user  against  electrical

shocks  or  other  unpleasant  effects.  A  typical  set  of

longreach tongs can extend to a length of 10 feet.

Long-Spoon Thieves Tools: Each of these items is a

specially modi ed version of a standard lockpicking tool

mounted on a long, thin handle. These tools enable the

user to manipulate a latch, tinker with a lock, or probe a

trap from a position up to 5 feet away and well to the side

of the target device. A 1-inch-diameter mirror mounted

on  a  similar  handle  gives  the  user  a  good  view  of  the

situation.  Though  some  traps  have  suf cient  range  to

in ict  harm  even  at  that  distance,  these  tools  make  it

possible for a wary rogue to avoid most common hazards,

such as poisoned needles or spurting acid.

54

Using these tools is more time-consuming and less

accurate  than  taking  the  direct  approach;  thus,  long-

spoon tools add 2 rounds to the time required and im-

pose a -2 circumstance penalty on any check for which

they  are  used.  Note,  however,  that  the  masterwork

bonus for a  nely made set offsets this latter penalty.

Mechanical  Burglar:  Another  gnome  invention,

the mechanical burglar is a tiny, clockwork device that

automatically picks mechanical locks. (It cannot bypass

magic locks.) The device is a sophisticated mechanism

in which springs extend and retract tiny metal probes

to manipulate a locks inner workings.

To  use  the  mechanical  burglar,  the  owner  simply

winds it up and inserts it into the lock where the key

would  normally   t.  The  device  is  not  silent;  it  ticks,

whirs, and pings the whole time it is working. A me-

chanical burglar takes 1d10 rounds to pick a lock.

The quality of the device determines how complex a

lock it can open, according to the following table.

Type

I

Very simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), or good

Very simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good

To  maintain  the  device,  the  owner  must  keep  it  dry,

oil it occasionally, and protect it from impact. Failure

to take proper care of the mechanical burglar causes it

to cease functioning until repaired, which costs half of

its original cost. The mechanical burglar only works on

traditional key locks and padlocks.

Reverse  Lock:  This  tricky  little  device  protects  the

contents of a room or container by frustrating burglars

until they give up and go away. When  rst encountered,

the reverse lock appears to be locked but actually is not.

If a character makes a successful unlocking attemptan

Open Lock check, an open or knock spell, or anything else

that  accomplishes  the  same  purposethe  device  then

locks itself but appears unlocked. A second successful at-

tempt to open the lock by any means causes it to unlock

and again appear locked.

Waterproofing: This useful compound comes in

the form of a thick paste or polish in a tin container.

When  rubbed  on  wooden,  leather,  paper,  parch-

ment, or metal items, it protects them from all water

damage  for  up  to  24  hours.  An  item  so  treated  suf-

fers  no  harm  from  any  type  of  water  exposurebe

it  dampness,  a  brief  shower,  or  even  complete  im-

mersion.  One  application  covers  an  object  the  size

of a lute or a pair of boots and lasts for seven days or

until exposed to water. A tin of waterproofing con-

tains  enough  polish  for  ten  applications.  Bards  in

particular  find  this  item  useful  for  protecting  their

precious  instruments  from  inclement  weather  and

sudden dunkings.

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Magic Items

Magic Items

This section features many wondrous items, and even

a magic sword and shield designed especially to appeal

to rogues and bards.

Magic Weapons and Armor

Magic Weapons and Armor

Rogues and bards can usually hold their own in combat,

but  some  additional  help  in  the  form  of  magic  weap-

onry or armor is always welcome. One of the following

items is designed especially for bards; the other is useful

to any character.

Barricade  Buckler:  The  correct  command  word

transforms this +1 buckler into a tower shield. Like any

other  tower  shield,  it  does  not  modify  AC  directly;

rather,  it  provides  up  to  total  cover  for  any  one  char-

acter behind it. A second command word shrinks the

barricade buckler back to its original size.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor,  enlarge;  Market  Price:  4,165  gp;  Weight:  5  Ib.  in

buckler form, 45 lb. in tower shield form.

Singing Sword: This intelligent +2 dancing longsword is

a unique weapon that has been passed from bard to bard

over the centuries. It loves two things to the exclusion of

all others: singing and  ghting. If its owner doesnt display

a passion for both of those activities, a personality con ict

occurs (see the Items Against Characters section in Chapter

8 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). Should that occur, the

sword demands that its owner either actively share its inter-

ests (by gaining ranks in Perform and perhaps even taking

up the bard class) or turn it over to a more suitable owner.

In the hands of a bard who enjoys battle, however,

the singing sword truly shines. Not only is it a formida-

ble weapon in combat, but it can also harmonize with

its  owner,  granting  him  a  +6  enhancement  bonus  on

any Perform checks that involve singing.

For  the   rst  few  weeks  after  acquiring  a  suitable  new

owner, the singing sword is content and eager to please. Over

time, however, personality conflicts can occur if other charac-

ters (especially lawful ones) prevent the bard from singing or

fighting. The singing sword always urges its owner forward into

combat and up onto the stage at every opportunity.

The singing sword has 10 ranks in Sense Motive, which,

combined with its Wisdom modi er, give it a total bonus

of +14 on Sense Motive checks. In addition, the sword can

detect law, and it grants its wielder free use of the Blind-

Fight feat. Finally, it can cast haste (duration 10 rounds)

on its wielder once per day. The singing sword is chaotic

neutral, with Int 11, Wis 19, Cha 15, and Ego 19. It speaks

Common and can communicate telepathically with any

creature that has a language.

Caster  Level:  12th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms

and Armor, animate objects, detect law, haste; Market Price:

127,855 gp; Weight: 4 lb.

Potions

Potions

This unusual potion is a favorite of assassins, rogues, and

members of the Lamenters Order (see Chapter 4).

55

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

Vial  of  the  Last  Gasp:  This  potion  is  actually  the

necromantically preserved last breath of some famous

 gure,  trapped  in  a  vial.  A  vial  of  the  last  gasp  allows

the  user  to  draw  strength  and  knowledge  from  the

dead  creature.  Anyone  who  unstoppers  the  vial  and

inhales its vapors gains 1d8 temporary hit points, a +2

enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +4 insight bonus

on  checks  using  one  Craft,  Knowledge,  or  Profession

skill  possessed  by  the  deceased.  The  creator  speci es

the  skill  to  which  the  bonus  applies  upon  creating

the potion, but it is usually the area of the deceaseds

greatest  expertise.  (This  does  not  allow  untrained

use  of  trained-only  skills.  If  the  potion  enhances  a

Knowledge  or  Profession  skill  that  the  user  does  not

already have, this bene t is useless.) Furthermore, the

fumes increase the users effective caster level by +1. All

these effects last for 10 minutes

Caster Level: 4th; Prerequisites: Brew Potion, death knell;

Market Price: 6,200 gp.

Wondrous Items

Perhaps more so than any other classes, rogues and bards

tend  to  use  wondrous  items.  The  ones  presented  here

are designed either for the use of rogues and bards, or to

protect items or characters from their particular talents.

Breaker Bottle: Potion bottles have an unfortunate

tendency to break at the wrong times. A breaker bottle.

however,  is  designed  to  break  only  upon  command.

It looks like an ordinary bottle of wood, metal, or very

heavy glass, but its outside is inscribed with an attractive

latticework design. The bottle has been imbued with a

shatter spell that activates by spell trigger. Thus, when

dropped,  it  simply  bounces.  When  thrown  across  a

room, it typically survives intact. But when the proper

trigger word is spoken, it  ies apart into shards along

the inscribed lines, scattering its contents.

Breaker bottles protect potions and other liquids from

harm, yet they can also serve as excellent grenadelike

weapons,  or  even  trap  components.  For  example,  a

character  could  simply  line  up  a  row  of  breaker  bottles

 lled with acid or alchemists  re atop a high shelf, wait

for a foe to pass near them, speak the trigger word, and

watch  the  content  s  rain  down  upon  the  unfortunate

targets head.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

shatter, Market Price: 150 gp; Weight: 1/10 lb.

Eyes of Dark Aura: When placed over the eyes, these

ebony lenses allow normal vision and reveal the state of

health  of  all  creatures  visible  to  the  wearer  within  25

feet. The eyes of dark aura indicate whether each is dead,

fragile  (3  or  fewer  hit  points  left),   ghting  off  death

(alive  with  4  or  more  hit  points),  undead,  or  neither

alive nor dead (a construct, for example). Members of

the  Lamenters  Order  (see  Chapter  4)  are  particularly

fond of this item.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

deathwatch; Market Price: 2,000 gp.

Flute of the Snake: The music of this  ute, which is

made from an exotic type of dark wood, affects snakes

of all kinds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion

effect that works like an animal trance spell, except that

it affects only snakes.

By playing a droning sequence of notes for 1 full round.

a musician with at least 5 ranks in Perform can summon

1d4+1 Medium-size vipers. These snakes appear wherever

the  utist designates, within a radius of 30 feet from the

 ute. They  ght on the musicians behalf, attacking on his

or her turn, and remain for 9 rounds or until killed

The  ute can put snakes into a trance three times per

day and summon snakes once per day.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item.

animal  trance,  summon  natures  ally  V;  Market  Price:

15,400 gp: Weight: 1 lb.

Harp  of  the  Immortal  Maestro:  This  pinnacle

of  instrument  design  functions  best  in  the  hands  of

a  musician  with  at  least  15  ranks  in  Perform.  Such  a

user can, simply by strumming the harp, generate the

following effects once per day each: cure critical wounds,

displacement  and  summon  monster  V.  The  harp  also

grants its owner a +6 enhancement bonus on Perform

checks made while using it. In addition, the harp of the

immortal  maestro  has  the  following  command-word

abilities, each usable once per day: levitate, magic circle

against evil, and fortissimo (see Chapter 6).

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

fortissimo, cure critical wounds, displacement, levitate, magic

circle against evil, summon monster V; Market Price: 69.580

gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Horn of Triumph: This silver trumpet is prized on

the  battle eld,  lor  its  music  can  signi cantly  improve

soldiers  combat  prowess.  When  a  character  with  the

bardic  music  ability  plays  the  horn  of  triumph,  each

willing  ally  within  15  feet  receives  a  +2  morale  bonus

on all saving throws, attack rolls, ability and skill checks,

and weapon damage rolls. Furthermore, every affected

creature gains a +2 morale bonus to both Strength and

Constitution  (which  improves  attack  bonuses  and

Fortitude  saves  accordingly)  but  suffers  a  -1  morale

penalty  to  AC.  The  instrument  compels  all  affected

creatures to  ght, heedless of danger.

The  effects  of  the  horn  last  as  long  as  the  musician

continues  to  play  and  the  affected  creatures  remain

within 15 feet. Moving out of range ends the effect for

the creature that did so, but others still within the radius

retain the bene ts. The horn can produce this magical

fanfare twice a day. It functions as a normal trumpet if its

user does not have the bardic music ability.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

emotion; Market Price: 35,380 gp; Weight: 3 lb

Jumping Caltrops: These unusual items are actually

Diminutive  animated  objects.  When  released  from

their bag, they begin hopping around the 5-foot square

in which they land. When someone tries to move into,

through, or within the square on foot, the jumping caltrops

56

CHAPTER 3: BARD & ROGUE EQUIPMENT

immediately  try  to  scurry  under  the  interlopers  feet.

They can move at a speed of up to 50 feet, though they

cannot leave their square.

The  number  of  caltrop  attacks  a  creature  suffers

while  within  the  affected  area  depends  on  its  speed:

four  for  normal  speed,  two  for  half  speed,  and  none

for  one-quarter  speed.  (One-quarter-speed  movement

assumes that the creature is shuf ing forward without

picking up its feet at all.) The targets shield, armor, and

de ection bonuses dont count against these attacks. A

target that is wearing shoes or other footwear, however,

gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. The speed of any target

that takes damage from a caltrop attack is reduced by

one-half because of the foot injury until the victim re-

ceives one successful Heal check, any cure spell, or any

other form of magical healing.

Jumping  caltrops  continue  to  move  for  11  rounds,

though the owner can order them back into the bag be-

fore the duration expires if desired. However, they can

move  only  on  their   rst  use;  thereafter,  they  become

normal caltrops.

Lute of the Wandering Minstrel: This  nely wrought

instrument  functions  as  a  masterwork  lute  with  minor

magical effects in the hands of someone with fewer than

10 ranks in Perform. By speaking the correct command

words, such a musician can utilize fortissimo (see Chapter

6), levitate, and magic circle against evil once per day each

A  musician  with  10  or  more  ranks  in  Perform,  how-

ever,  can  coax  even  greater  magical  effects  from  this

instrument. By playing single chord on the lute, such a

performer can generate an expeditious retreat, haste, or phan-

tom steed effect.Each of these spells is usable once per day.

Furthermore,  the  lute  of  the  wandering  minstrel  grants  its

owner a +2 enhancement bonus on any Perform checks

made while playing it.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, for-

tissimo, expeditious retreat, haste, levitate, magic circle against

evil, phantom steed; Market Price: 39,500 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Mandolin of the Inspiring Muse: Bards and other

musicians  prize  this  carefully  crafted  mandolin.  An

owner with at least 15 ranks in Perform can use crescendo

(see Chapter 6), emotion, and dominate person, each once

per day, by playing the correct notes. The musician also

gains a +4 enhancement bonus on any Perform checks

made while playing the mandolin of the inspiring muse.

The mandolin also has the following command-word

abilities, each usable once per day: levitate, magic circle

against evil, and fortissimo (see Chapter 6).

Caster  Level:  9th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

fortissimo, crescendo, dominate person, emotion, levitate, magic

circle against evil; Market Price: 53,920 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Nondescript Box: A nondescript box is perfectly ordi-

nary in appearance, and it always seems to  t in with its

surroundings. In fact, it  ts in so well that it is very dif -

cult to notice. The eye seems to skip over it, and the mind

forgets its presence immediately. Characters walk around

a nondescript box without even realizing they have done so,

and observers  nd nothing strange about such detours.

Search attempts always fail to locate this item, and it radi-

ates no magic. However, a successful Spot check (DC 25)

enables the mind to pierce the boxs protections and see it

clearly. Once someone has pointed it out, others can see

it as well. So well is it protected, however, that a character

who does  nd it must make a successful Will save (DC

25)  or  forget  to  take  it  along  upon  departure.  The  non-

descript box becomes a normal box in every way once its

contents are removed.

Those  who  can  afford  nondescript  boxes  typically  use

them  to  stash  valuables,  incriminating  documents,  or

other items that they wish to keep others from  nding.

A typical nondescript box is about the size of a small cof-

fer18 inches long by 1 foot deep by 1 foot high.

Caster Level: 13th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Possum Pouch: Also known as a false stomach, a pos-

sum pouch is a small,  at, circular bag about 10-12 inches

in  diameter  and  up  to  2  inches  thick.  When  placed

against a humanoids abdomen and sealed there with a

command word, it blends in unobtrusively with the sur-

rounding skin, requiring a successful Search check (DC

30) to detect. Spies and couriers  nd these items useful

as hidden diplomatic pouches, while nobles and wealthy

merchants sometimes use them as superior money belts.

Assassins and sneak-thieves love possum pouches because

they  make  it  easy  to  smuggle  poisons  and  small  valu-

ables into or out of well-guarded houses.

Safe Box: This reinforced box keeps anything inside

it safe from damage by most outside forces. Made of 2-

inch-thick adamantine, it has a hardness of 40 and has

80 hit points. In addition, it ignores the  rst 12 points

of  damage  from   re  and  acid,  and  any  direct  attack

against it has a 50% miss chance.

Safe boxes can come in a range of sizes and shapes, from

scroll cases to large boxes. Though they are very expen-

sive, people with irreplaceable items to protect consider

boxes highly as instrument cases.

strings is fully charged).

Spool  of  Endless  Rope:  Some  adventurers  never

seem  to  have  enough  rope.  The  spool  of  endless  rope

contains 300 feet of the  nest silk rope, yet the whole

weighs  only  10  pounds.  The  spool  comes  with  a  belt

loop so that it can hang conveniently at an adventurers

side. One end of the rope is attached so  rmly inside

the spool that a sharp tug would pull the owner over

before it would break the connection.

To use it, the owner feeds out as little or as much rope

as desired, up to a maximum of 300 feet. When  nished

with the rope, the owner can simply wind it back onto

the spool. (Rewinding requires 1 round per 50 feet fed

out, rounded up.)

If some of the rope is cut off, the rest remains attached

to the spool and works as before, though its total length is

shortened by the amount removed. Extra lengths can be

tied onto the rope to extend its length beyond 300 feet, but

that extra length cannot be wound into the spool.

Some owners of spools of endless rope like to use them

in conjunction with grapple- ring crossbows (see New

Weapons, page 51).

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Leomunds secret chest, 5 ranks of Use Rope; Market Price:

2,000 gp; Weight: 10 lb.

Strings of Spell Storing: This set of six catgut strings

for  a  lute,  mandolin,  or  other  stringed  instrument  has

up to six levels of spells stored within it. By playing the

proper sequence of notes (a standard action) on an instru-

ment strung with these and making a successful Perform

check (DC 10), a musician can unleash the desired spell.

As with a wand, the user need not provide any material

components or focus and pays no XP cost to cast the spell.

No arcane spell failure chance exists because the musi-

cian doesnt need to gesture.

A spellcaster with at least one rank in Perform can cast

any spells into the strings, as long as the total spell levels

do not add up to more than six. To store each spell, the

caster must make a successful Perform check (DC 10 +

spell level). Failure causes the spell to  zzle. For exam-

ple, a bard could cast protection from good and cure moderate

wounds into the strings, then give them to a wizard with

the Perform skill, who could cast  reball into them. Any

character with the Perform skill could then cast all three

spells from the strings.

Treat  a  randomly  generated  set  of  strings  of  spell

storing  as  a  scroll  to  determine  what  spells  are  stored

within it. If you roll a spell that would put the set over

its six-level limit, ignore that roll; those strings have no

Thief Catcher (Hungry Book): This insidious item

is the bane of thieves everywhere. It appears to be an or-

dinary book, but, in fact, it is a trap. A successful Search

check by a rogue or other character with the traps ability

reveals the presence of a magic trap. Detect magic used in

conjunction with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15)

reveals only abjuration magic.

The book is locked with an arcane lock spell, so it re-

fuses to open until that is bypassed, suppressed, or ne-

gated by any of the usual means (see the spell descrip-

tion  in  the  Players  Handbook).  The  owner  of  the  book

can freely bypass the lock. Any other attempt works as

it  normally  would,  but  also  primes  the  trap.  A  Search

check (DC 30) made by a character with the traps ability

after an attempt to bypass the arcane lock reveals that a

trap is still in place.

Once  the  trap  is  primed,  the   rst  character  who

opens  the  thief  catcher  is  sucked  into  the  book,  which

promptly slams shut. It then holds that prisoner inde -

nitely  in  stasisthe  victim  is  conscious  of  his  or  her

surroundings but unable to move, speak, or activate any

powers or abilities.

Once it has a prisoner, the book becomes harmless to

others, and Search checks reveal no more traps. Anyone

else who opens the book sees a lifelike illustration of the

prisoner as its frontispiece. The text is a series of stories

about thieves who came to bad ends, and the prisoners

name  appears  in  red  as  the  unfortunate  protagonist  of

each tale. Each of these stories ends with a pious moral

about the virtue of leaving others property alone. When

the book is in this state, detect magic used in conjunction

with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15) reveals trans-

mutation magic.

The  trapped  character  can  be  retrieved  only  with  a

limited wish or a spell of equivalent power. If the book

is  burned,  any  prisoner  inside  dies,  leaving  behind

lifesized bones among the ashes. A thief catcher can be

used only once; if a trapped character is freed, the text

remains, but the frontispiece is gone, and the book is

no longer magical.

Thief  catchers  are  extremely  rare.  It  is  rumored  that

their creator was an archwizard who had lost one too

manyprecious  magic  items  to  daring  rogues.  Because

this item is not stationary like the typical magic device

trap, it is treated as a wondrous item.

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

CHAPTER 4:

ORGANIZATIONS

FOR BARDS

AND ROGUES

Nearly  every  city  of  any  size  has  an  organized  band

of thievesits a fantasy staple. Some large cities also

have bardic colleges, where bards can learn music from

the  masters  and  exchange  songs,  tales,  and  expertise.

This chapter offers detailed descriptions often thieves

guilds and seven bardic colleges that you can either use

as presented or modify for your campaign.

TEN THIEVES GUILDS

Each thieves guild is uniquethe product of a particu-

lar city, time, and set of leaders. Some guilds are pow-

erful  organizations  of  highly  placed  characters  who

pull  strings  from  the  shadows.  Others  consist  mainly

of  thieves,  thugs,  and  brigands  who  are  always  just

one step ahead of the lawor at each others throats.

Regardless  of  its  type,  however,  any  thieves  guild  is

bound to have rogues of every stripe as members.

This  section  presents  ten  thieves  guilds,  ranging

from the stereotypical to the unusual. Each description

includes a rundown of the structure, rules, methods of

advancement,  locations,  assets,  organizational  goals,

and  potential  con icts,  as  well  as  a  set  of  adventure

hooks that you can use to get PCs involved. Dont feel

constrained by the individual details, though; its easy

to combine two or more of these concepts.

Keep in mind that not every thief is a rogue, and not

every thief belongs to a guild. Any guildmaster worth

her  salt  realizes  what  an  asset  a  smooth-talking  bard,

powerful  wizard,  or  tough-as-nails   ghter  is  to  her

organization.  Also,  independent  or  freelance  thieves

abound  in  any  fantasy  settingplenty  of  con  artists

and  burglars  arent  keen  on  turning  a  percentage  of

their pro ts over to a guild hierarchy.

The Traditional Thieves Guild

The Traditional Thieves Guild

This thieves guild is organized the same way that guilds

for  artisans  and  merchants  are.  Though  its  members

operate beyond the law, its internal structure would be

familiar to any professional in a more mundane  eld.

This is the most common type of thieves guild.

Organization: Traditional thieves guilds subdivide

their members by either specialty (pickpocket, second-

story burglar, mugger, and the like) or location. In both

cases, a separate leader oversees each subgroupthat

is,  one  guildmaster  regulates  each  criminal  specialty,

or  one  block  boss  controls  each  neighborhood.  The

largest  traditional  guilds  have  both  neighborhood-

and  specialty-based  leaders.  Though  this  abundance

of leaders increases the guilds level of control, it also

adds signi cantly to its overall bureaucracy. Both types

operate ef ciently for the most part, with their leaders

conferring  regularly  and  assembling  interdisciplinary

teams for speci c missions.

The leaders in charge of the various specialties and

neighborhoods typically form a ruling council for the

guild as a whole. Some councils decide all major guild

issues by vote, while others serve as advisory bodies to

a single, overall guildmaster.

Information  generally  spreads  quickly  through

such  an  organization,  but  now  and  then  a  traditional

guild  has  so  many  ranks  and  subgroups  that  one  sec-

tion doesnt know what another is doing. Because this

type of guild takes organizational issues very seriously,

however, its leaders usually deal with communication

problems quickly.

Guild Rules: Control is tight in a traditional guild.

Members  must  ask  permission  to  ply  their  trades  in

certain  areas  or  against  speci c  targets,  so  as  not  to

endanger any lucrative deals or interfere with the mis-

sions  of  other  members.  Those  who  refuse  to  follow

guild rules face severe punishment or expulsion from

the guild.

Advancement  Opportunities:  Advancement  in

a  traditional  guild  happens  quickly  at   rst.  The  orga-

nization  is  a  meritocracy  at  lower  levels,  so  the  most

capable  members  tend  to  get  the  most  lucrative  jobs.

Some guilds built on the specialty structure go as far as

to assign job ranks and titles within each specialty, so a

member might be able to advance from apprentice to

journeyman  pickpocket,  or  from  burglar  second-class

to  burglar  captain.  A  few  even  offer  formal  training

classes and a series of exams as part of this promotion

process. Advancement to leadership positions tends to

be more dif cult and less structured than gaining ranks

in a specialty, and competition for such posts is  erce.

Often,  the  only  way  to  move  up  is  to  bring  someone

else down.

Locations:  A  traditional  guild  is  likely  to  have  a

central, permanent meeting place of some kind of-

ten  a  building,  catacomb,  or  other  sturdy  structure.

The  guildhouse  is  guarded  around  the  clock,  and

thieves come and go at all hours to drop off the eve-

nings take, make reports, or train for promotion. The

guildhouse is usually either hidden or disguised with

a front business. Particularly brazen guildmasters in

cities  where  law  enforcement  is  casual  maintain  of-

 cial guildhouses among their craft- and trade-union

counterparts. Even in towns where the thieves guild

has a more discreet arrangement, however, it usually

isnt dif cult for visiting rogues to make contact with

guild representatives.

If a traditional guild has been very successful of late,

the guildhouse itself may be the juiciest target for a dar-

ing PC thief. Although the rewards inside guild

59

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

coffers  may  be  spectacular,  however,  stealing  from

thieves  is  unbelievably  dangerous.  They  know  all  the

usual tricks because they use them every night. Expect

a   endish  array  of  traps  combined  with  alert  guards,

plus a quick response to any alarm.

A  guild  of  this  type  usually  maintains  an  array  of

subordinate locations, including safe houses and places

to hold clandestine meetings. These satellite locations

may  be  permanent  or  temporary,  depending  on  how

worried  the  guild  is  about  the  local  law  enforcement

agencies.

Assets:  Although  its  not  easy  to  get  criminals  to

follow rules, organization is this guilds greatest asset.

By  coordinating  crimes,  the  guild  leaders  can  keep

law  enforcement  of cials  guessing.  By  matching  ap-

propriate guild members to each task, they can ensure

that crimes are both successful and lucrative. Sharing

information also increases the effectiveness of all guild

members.  When  a  rogue  is  planning  a  getaway  after

a  robbery,  its  good  to  know  the  rooftop  escape  route

that the burglars have been using for weeks, or which

city  guard  sergeants  are  in  the  pocket  of  the  guilds

smugglers.

A traditional guild tends to amass signi cant wealth

because it collects a percentage of the take from each

of its members crimes. The structured nature of such

a  guild  makes  it  more  dif cult  to  freelance  or  to

underreport income than it is in less organized opera-

tions. But the expenses of a traditional guild are high as

wellcareful planning often entails bribes, specialized

equipment, and other signi cant payouts.

Goals:  The  purpose  of  this  guild  is  enrichment

either of the guild as a whole or of its highest-ranking

members. A traditional thieves guild usually supports

the status quo in the city where it operates. Its leaders

have spent too much time organizing their operations

and  creating  a  niche  for  the  guild  within  the  local

economy to welcome any signi cant changes.

The guild leaders themselves are intimately familiar

with the law enforcement and justice systems in their

city, and theyve probably in ltrated them. They keep

the  city  watch  of cers  off-balance  but  allow  them  to

catch enough small-time thieves to preserve the status

quo. Likewise, the guild leaders keep a careful watch on

the nobles and merchants they target. After all, ruining

a merchant through relentless thefts and assaults tends

to  impoverish  the  city  as  a  wholenot  only  is  that

merchant gone, but other merchants may think twice

before opening new businesses there. Thus, the guilds

leadership tries to leave victims with enough working

capital  to  recover  their  fortuneswhich  can  then  be

plundered anew.

The  guilds  enforcers  aggressively  hunt  down  any

freelancer who tries to make a dishonest living within

the  city.  Nonguild  thieves  represent  lost  revenue  be-

cause  they  arent  contributing  to  the  guilds  coffers.

Freelancers also can ruin carefully laid plans by beating

guild thieves to a lucrative target or antagonizing law

enforcement  agencies,  which  may  then  crack  down

on everyone. Finally, guild thieves tend to accept the

strictures of the organization better if they know that

going freelance means living on the runand perhaps

dying very early.

Con  icts:  Trying  to  ruin  a  well-organized  thieves

guild  can  be  a  frustrating  experience  for  the  citys

law  enforcers.  Some  watch  captains  simply  give  up

and accept guild stipends in exchange for looking the

other way, but others soldier on, catching criminals as

best they can. Often the only way to keep the guilds

thieves  from  targeting  a  particular  neighborhood

or  committing  a  certain  type  of  crime  is  to  make  it

prohibitively  dif cultand  thus  no  longer  cost-

effectiveto succeed.

Concerted  opposition  to  guild  activities  can  also

come  from  merchants  and  nobles,  who  typically  use

their own resources to guard their wealth. Merchants

fortify  their  buildings,  and  nobles  often  hire  body-

guards.  Business  owners  in  particular  understand  the

mindset of the thieves guild leaderstheyre running

similar  (though  legal)  businesses,  after  all.  Some  may

even agree to pay the guild protection money for the

privilege of being left alone.

Hooks:  Many  rogues  receive  their  initial  training

from  more  experienced  thieves.  Such  characters  may

return to their old stomping grounds when they want

more  training,  information,  or  some  other  kind  of

assistance.

Adventurers who steal inside a city with a well orga-

nized thieves guild draw less than friendly attention.

The  guilds  leaders  may  mark  them  for  death,  send

thieves  to  steal  their  loot,  or  dispatch  enforcers  to

threaten  them  with  unpleasant  consequences  if  they

fail to leave town or join the guild immediately.

Characters who  aunt their wealth are inviting atten-

tion from the local thieves guild. Whether its members

decide to hold the adventurers up at knifepoint, pick

their pockets on the street, or burglarize their rooms at

the inn, they take the time to study their targets move-

ments and plan the crime well. Though theyre accus-

tomed to taking risks, guild thieves arent suicidal; they

quickly retreat if their plans go awry.

Enterprising adventurers might also want to do some

business with the local guild. Most thieves guilds have

ef cient  networks  offences  who  are  willing  to  pur-

chase  unusual  goods.  Alternatively,  the  characters

might wish to buy something that only the guild can

provide, such as a map of the lords castle or safe passage

through the citys sewers.

Example: The Rockroost Thieves Guild

Example: The Rockroost Thieves Guild

The  bustling  Free  City  of  Rockroost  has  an  equally

bustling thieves guild. The more than three hundred

thieves, con artists, and thugs who make up its mem-

bership rule many neighborhoods after nightfall.

60

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

About one hundred guild members have skill designa-

tions,  such  as  second-story  burglar,  caravan-jacker,  or

con  artist.  Most  are  rogues,  although  many  of  the  con

artists have bardic training, and most of the burglars who

specialize in armed robbery have spent time as  ghters.

The other members are musclebound thugs of indiffer-

ent ability but solid discipline.

One of the most sought-after titles in the Rockroost

Guild is that of thief-acrobat. The guildmaster, Maurid

Attelayan,  (human  Rog5/Thief-Acrobat10/Wiz3)  rose

through the ranks of the thief-acrobats himself. Hes not

as nimble as he once was, but he keeps a cadre of capable

thief-acrobats as his personal guard.

Any character who commits a burglary or other crime

in Rockroost gets a visit from a recruiter. After maintain-

ing surveillance for a time, the recruiter approaches the

target and explains the bene ts of guild membership

and the fact that its mandatory. If rebuffed, the recruiter

smiles and departsonly to return later with an army of

thugs to make the point more forcefully.

The Mob

The Mob

The  leaders  of  some  thieves  guilds  stress  personal

loyalty  over  structure  and  organization.  Often  the

members  of  such  guilds  focus  on  vice  rather  than

property-related crimes. These mob guilds are tightly

knit networks of thieves who operate a variety of illegal

businesses, including underground gambling rings, il-

licit goods traf c, and protection rackets.

Organization:  Its  no  accident  that  these  guilds

are often called families. Though the bulk of such an

organization is just hired muscle and talent, its leaders

are usually bound by blood and marriage, just as noble

families are.

A typical mob guild has a single patriarch or matri-

arch,  a  handful  of  senior  leaders,  most  of  whom  are

related  in  some  way,  and  a  few  dozen  trusted  made

thieves. Unlike hired hands, who are disposable, made

thieves can rely on the guild to get them out of prison,

protect  their  families  in  troubled  times,  and  perhaps

even provide living expenses when their thieving days

are over.

Titles vary widely among mob guilds, but they almost

never sound businesslike. Some leaders favor family ti-

tles, with a single grandfather or grandmother at the

top, uncles and aunts in the upper ranks, and broth-

ers and sisters in the lowest levels. Hired thugs are

called children in this arrangement, of course. Other

guilds use more esoteric titles. One such guild, for ex-

ample, is led by an eagle assisted by several hawks.

The bulk of that organizations members are falcons,

sparrows, and other small birds.

Guild  Rules:  The  glue  that  binds  this  guild  to-

gether is a rigid code of loyalty. Mob codes typically

include  respect  for  superiors,  silence  in  the  face  of

interrogation,  and  unswerving  loyalty  to  the  fam-

ily.  There  may  be  a  feudal  aspect  as  welllow-level

thieves pledge their services (and often their lives) in

exchange  for  protection  from  the  authorities,  better

lifestyles than they would otherwise have, and a vari-

ety of other favors.

The  entire  culture  of  this  organization  revolves

around  demonstrations  of  loyalty  in  the  face  of  peril

and temptation. To reveal a secret is to welcome death.

Even  the  lowest  thug  knows  that  those  who  talk  to

the  authorities  are  inevitably  silenced  (permanently).

In  fact,  large  guilds  of  this  type  employ  killers  who

do nothing but enforce the code. Thus, members of a

mob guild usually take great pains to demonstrate their

family loyalty to superiors and outsiders alike.

Advancement  Opportunities:  Many  of  the  thugs

and rogues who form the lower echelons of a mob guild

hope to impress their leaders enough to become made

thieves. Advancement within the upper ranks happens

much  the  same  waythe  trick  is  to  display  enough

talent to impress ones superiors, yet not enough to be

perceived as a threat. Aspiring to a high rank in such a

guild is risky, for although the bonds are tight, rivalries

are  erce. In the end, after all, only one guild member

can rise all the way to the top.

Assets:  Since  a  mob  guild  focuses  on  vice  crimes

rather  than  on  theft,  its  income  tends  to  be  much

steadier than that of a traditional thieves guild. Rather

than hoping for a big score, the leaders of a mob guild

run their rackets like businesses, protecting their exist-

ing turf while remaining alert for new opportunities.

61

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

A  steady  stream  of  gold  enables  guild  leaders  to

live in luxury, and they tend to  aunt their wealth. A

wealthy lifestyle is an excellent recruiting tool because

it  shows  would-be  members  the  rewards  that  await

them if they work hard and remain loyal. In addition,

many  a  highranking  mobster  eventually  develops  a

peculiar  craving  for  legitimacy,  and  the  trappings  of

nobility can help to provide that.

Locations:  Mob  leaders  typically  conduct  guild

business out of their own manor homes. A great feast

or party can be the backdrop for the delivery of a dire

threat  or  the  clinching  of  an  important  deal.  During

quieter moments, a leader may ponder guild member

reports  or  discuss  an  upcoming  mission  with  under-

lings in an opulent gallery or sitting room. Well-trained

bodyguards are always present, though they may be dis-

guised or hidden by magic. High-ranking mobsters are

accustomed  to  periodic  eruptions  of  violence  during

social events, so theyre always prepared.

On  the  street,  mob  guilds  operate  networks  of  safe

houses  and  meeting  places,  but  the  locations  change

frequently. Low-level thugs typically receive orders to

show  up  at  a  particular  warehouse  and  await  instruc-

tions.  Higher-ranking  guild  operatives,  however,  try

not  to  remain  too  well  hiddenafter  all,  a  certain

degree of visibility and access is necessary to keep the

guilds many rackets operating smoothly. For example,

everyone  in  the  neighborhood  might  know  that  Du-

rank, a falcon in the Gathra family, takes dinner once a

week in the back room of the Pepperpot Inn.

Goals:  A  mob  wants  its  rackets  to  provide  steady,

lucrative  income,  so  its  leaders  generally  support  the

status  quo  in  their  city.  Most  mob  bosses  also  want

to leave strong organizations as legacies to their

childrenwhether by blood or by oath. Thus,

it is preservation, not merely pro t, that drives

the typical mob guild.

Some  mob  leaders  eventually  grow  tired

of  walking  on  the  far  side  of  the  law  and

try  to  make  their  organizations  legitimate,

which  requires  dropping  the  lucrative

mob rackets in favor of less exciting

mercantile  opportunities.  This

is  a  dif cult  road  to  walk,

for  some  people  in  the

organization  may  not

want  to  give  up  their

criminal  lives.  In  ad-

dition,  the  local

authorities  may

not  believe  that

the effort is genu-

ineand even

if  they  do,

some  prob-

ably

bear

old grudges.

Con  icts:  This  type  of  guild  is  always  in  con ict

with  law  enforcement  agents  intent  on  breaking  up

the  vice  rackets  that  are  the  mobs  bread  and  butter.

The mobs code of silence, however, makes it hard to

pin anything on the higher-ups in the organization.

The  mobs  best  defense  against  law  enforcement

(aside from the usual array of bribes and intimidation

tactics)  is  the  fact  that  the  leaders  always  take  pains

to cover their own tracks. Thus, the city watch might

know  that  a  particular  guild  leader  is  responsible  for

a crime but be unable to prove it. In cities where the

burden of proof is low or nonexistent, mob leaders and

their guilds are much more secretive, and many leaders

are known only by nicknames.

Hooks:  One  or  more  of  the  characters  worked  as

lowlevel muscle for a mob guild before taking up the

adventurers life. Now the mob wants a favor.

A character was born into a mob family but wants no

part  of  that  lifestyle.  Some  guild  members  resent  the

character  for  letting  the  family  down,  while  others

are more sympathetic. After all, in the chess game that

determines  who  the  next  matriarch  or  patriarch  will

be,  even  a  family  member  who  has  rejected  the  mob

life may be a useful pawn.

If  the  characters  utilize  any  of  a  citys  typical  vice

rackets (an illicit casino, for example), they may run

afoul of a mob guild. They may simply be customers

in  the  wrong  place  at  the  wrong  time,  or  they  may

have  something  the  guild

wants.  Alternatively,

that

the  mayhem

characters

often  leave  in  their

mobs  ire.  Its  never

a  good  idea  to  burn

down  the  inn  that

house.

A  lawful  charac-

ter  may  receive  a

up  the  town,  or

may  even  take  on

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

Example: The Gathra Mob

Example: The Gathra Mob

The Gathra family controls most of the smuggling, gam-

bling,  and  other  vice  crimes  in  a  large  city.  Some  forty

years  ago,  Iuto  Gathra  assumed  the  leadership  of  what

was then a traditional thieves guild. By changing its fo-

cus from muggings and burglaries to less risky rackets, he

made the guild wealthy. Now it has its tendrils in almost

every part of society.

Its not easy to stay on top, though. The mob has been

successful,  but  its  current  eagle,  Nenosino  Gathra,  is

beset with problems. His cousin has been steadily build-

ing  in uence  within  the  family  in  preparation  for  a

takeover. The church of Heironeous has just announced

a crusade to rid the city of evildoers. And Nenos own

daughter,  Zaleya,  has  chosen  the  life  of  an  adventurer

against  her  fathers  wishes.  She  left  the  family  com-

pound  ve days ago after an argument with Neno and

hasnt been seen since.

Thus,  Neno  is  ready  for  trouble.  He  keeps  a  hand

crossbow loaded with a poisoned bolt in a glove of storing,

and with his Quick Draw feat, he usually gets the drop

on foes who have crossed him. Neno has two goals in a

 ght: to be the one who starts it, and to be the one who

 nishes itby either winning or escaping.

Neighborhood Gang

Neighborhood Gang

Not every city has a well-organized criminal network.

Many,  in  fact,  have  nothing  but  neighborhood-based

gangs,  each  of  which  controls  the  criminal  activity

in  an  area  no  larger  than  a  few  city  blocks.  Members

of  such  gangs  run  local  protection  rackets,  commit

crimes, and war over turf with other nearby gangs.

Organization:  A  neighborhood  gang  rarely  has

more  than   fty  active  members.  These  street  toughs

organize themselves in a sort of pack structure, with a

single dominant leader (generally the toughest among

them)  in  charge.  A  particularly  large  gang  may  have

lieutenants who help the leader manage the others, but

this is rare.

In  a  large  city,  a  network  of  limited  alliances  may

spring  up  among  the  street  gangs.  Allied  gangs  can

rely on each other for help in a  ght or get unmolested

access through each others territories. Such alliances

arent terribly strong, and they shift frequently as new

gangs emerge and old ones betray each other.

Guild Rules: The leaders word is law for everyone

in a gang. Beyond that, gang members form a hierarchy

of toughness: Each member can give orders to anyone

he or she can physically dominate.

Advancement  Opportunities:  Gang  members  can

move up in the toughness hierarchy by improving their

physical prowess. To become leader, however, a challeng-

er must topple the current leader, usually by violence.

Assets: The residents of a gangs neighborhood know

all its members well. That notoriety is in itself a strange

kind  of  asset,  for  it  buys  the  reluctant  cooperation  of

those who dont want to  ght the whole gang.

Members of a gang also have unparalleled knowledge

of the neighborhood they call home. They know every

blind alley, open basement window, and catwalk across

the  rooftops.  They  know  also,  for  example,  that  Sacnu

the cooper is willing to do anything if you threaten his

daughter, and that Kril Ironbeard holds a grudge against

the militia. Thus,  ghting a gang on its home turfor

getting any cooperation from neighborhood residents

can be a daunting prospect.

Locations: Gangs tend to use simple hideouts, such as

abandoned buildings, dingy taverns, and the like. How-

ever, theres rarely anyone at a hideout, since gang mem-

bers spend most of their time patrolling their turf or col-

lecting protection money from neighborhood shops.

Goals:  Though  they  differ  in  structure  and  outward

appearance  from  traditional  thieves  guilds,  gangs  per-

form almost exactly the same functions. Most focus on

muggings,  smash-and-grab  property  crimes,  and  pro-

tection rackets, although particularly gifted gang leaders

sometimes branch out into subtler crimes.

Con  icts: Gang con icts are nearly always physical

 ghts  involving  one  of  three  groups:  victims,  other

gangs, and law enforcement of cials.

Fights with crime victims tend to be brief. Usually a

store owner or the target of a mugging gives in to the

threat  of  violence  (or  the   rst  punch),  and  the  crime

proceeds quickly. But if the mugging victim turns out

to be a powerful wizard, or the store owner has hired

adventurers  as  bodyguards,  gang  members  usually

 eefew are actually willing to put their lives on the

line for a few coins.

Gang  ghts tend to be all-out street brawls, with little

quarter  asked  or  given.  In  this  type  of  con ict,  morale

tends  to  be  high.  Running  away  from  a  mugging  gone

awry is just good sense, but running from a scrap with the

Wharf Rat gang is the worst kind of cowardice.

63

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

Gang members dont  ght the city guard unless vic-

tory is certain. Eluding the law by  eeing through the

back  alleys  of  the  neighborhood  is  much  easier  than

 ghting  well-armed  soldiers.  Often,  neighborhood

residents  actually  tip  off  members  of  the  gang  that  a

guard contingent is on the way, giving them extra time

to melt into the shadows.

Hooks:  Someone  in  the  neighborhood  who  needs

protection from a particularly violent street gang hires

the characters to guard a store, or simply to wipe out

the  gang.  If  its  a  large  gang,  the  adventurers  might

have to in ltrate it  rst.

In a corrupt city ruled by evil leaders, the neighbor-

hood gang is the only authority on which the residents

can rely. Gang members still collect protection money,

but in return they actually protect local people from the

oppression of a capricious despot.

A  character  who  once  belonged  to  a  gang  left  the

city rather than face the ire of the angry leader. Alter-

natively, a character might return to his or her child-

hood neighborhood only to  nd it infested with street

gangs. In the eyes of the city guard, of course, theres

not  much  difference  between  a  group  of  adventurers

and a street gang.

Typical Street Gang Member

Typical Street Gang Member

This half-orc thug and others like him give his neighbor-

hood its reputation. Active mostly at night, he commits

a  variety  of  muggings,  burglaries,  and  robberies,  which

produce  just  enough  money  to  let  him  survive.  Some-

times he has a stroke of luck and someone else (perhaps

a member of a traditional thieves guild) hires him for his

imposing  presence  and  brawn.  After  all,  its  inherently

scarier when a half-orc asks for ones coin pouch than it is

when a hal ing does.

Assassins Guild

Assassins Guild

Although  they  operate  far  outside  the  law,  assassins

guilds most often establish themselves in lawful cities.

Though this seems a paradox, its a logical result of the

way  people  who  live  in  such  communities  behave.  In

a  city  swept  by  chaos,  con ict  is  out  where  everyone

can see it. Its easy for people to tell who their enemies

aretheyre the ones attacking them. No one needs an

assassin to eliminate the competition in a lawless citya

wizard or  ghter does the job just  ne. Lawful cities, on

the  other  hand,  tend  to  be  rich  with  intrigue.  Here,

con ict occurs beneath a civilized, law-abiding veneer.

In this sort of environment, anyone with a vendetta to

carry out or someone to eliminate is willing to pay for an

assassins poisoned blade.

Organization: Assassins guilds are structured much

like traditional thieves guilds. Typically, each has one

overall leader, and large ones may have several sublead-

ers in charge of certain specialties. However, assassins

guilds tend to be much smaller than their thieves guild

counterparts, and almost no one outside the organiza-

tion knows who is actually in chargeor indeed, who

might be a member.

Most members of an assassins guild work from the

shadows, carrying out their missions of death without

ever  revealing  their  own  faces  or  names.  To  do  any

business,  however,  the  guild  must  have  a  way  for

potential  customers  to  contact  guild  representatives.

Often,  some  individual  or  group  (such  as  a  thieves

guild or a particular merchant) serves as an intermedi-

ary for the assassins guild. Though no direct af liation

exists,  the  assassins  do  tend  to  protect  any  conduits

they  have  for  new  business.  The  intermediary  puts

interested  customers  in  contact  with  an  agent  of  the

assassins  guild,  who  draws  up  the  contract,  decides

upon  a  price,  and  presents  the  contract  to  the  guild.

(Occasionally an agent allows an established customer

to pay only part of the price up frontassassins make

enthusiastic bill collectors, so a problem rarely occurs

with  overdue  payments.)  Like  the  assassins  them-

selves,  guild  agents  never  reveal  either  their  faces  or

their names to customers.

The  guildmasters  then  assign  each  job  to  either  a

single assassin or a team, depending on the dif culty of

the target. If all goes well, the assassination occurs, the

assassin  escapes,  and  the  agent  is  already  contracting

new targets for the guild.

Although  assassins  guilds  specialize  in  murder,

some  also  accept  other  types  of  jobsshakedowns,

espionage, or high-pro le thefts, for example. After all,

the skill set of an assassin lends itself to many uses.

Guild Rules: Like a traditional thieves guild, an as-

sassins guild takes a percentage of each contract. In re-

turn, the organization arranges new contracts and pro-

vides training, resources, and shelter for its members.

The only other rule common to all assassins guilds is

the code of silence: Revealing anything about the guild

results in an automatic death sentence, carried out by

experts in the  eld.

Advancement  Opportunities:  Occasionally,  guild-

masters  retire  and  pass  the  leadership  to  quali ed  suc-

cessors.  Most  of  the  time,  however,  transfers  of  power

within an assassins guild occur in the expected way

through assassination of higher-ranking members.

Assets: The biggest asset an assassins guild has is the

frightening prowess of the membership itself. All assas-

sins are capable foes, and what they lack in numbers they

64

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

guilds,  however,  have  their  own  political  agendas.

Members of these organizations refuse to accept as tar-

gets any public  gures they support, and in some cases

they  even  assassinate  enemies  of  their  political  allies

with  neither  contracts  nor  payments.  Most  would-be

rulers,  however,  are  reluctant  to  accept  an  assassins

guild as an ally because they fear the consequences of

betrayal.

Con  icts: The primary con icts involving assassins

guilds are, of course, those between assassins and their

victims. In these  ghts, the assassins typically have the

advantage. They get plenty of time to study their vic-

tims habits, and they can choose the time, place, and

method  of  assassination.  The  toughest  part  is  getting

away  clean  afterward  while  bodyguards,  soldiers,  and

assorted hangers-on are combing the site in search of

the killer.

A guild member who takes on a broader array of jobs

might also come into con ict with law enforcement, or

with  merchants  or  thieves  guilds  fearful  of  competi-

tion for their territories. Leaders of most organizations,

however,  think  twice  about  making  an  enemy  of  the

assassins guild.

Hooks: The most obvious hook is the simplest: Ene-

mies hire an assassin to eliminate one of the characters.

Whether  or  not  the  attempt  succeeds,  the  characters

might  seek  vengeance  against  the  guild  as  a  whole,

or they might attack the headquarters to  nd out who

hired the assassin in the  rst place.

Characters  interested  in  the  assassin  prestige  class

might  contact  the  guild  seeking  to  join,  or  simply  to

purchase deadly poisons or other tools of the trade.

In a politics-oriented adventure, hiring an assassin

to eliminate a pesky foe might be the simplest path to

victory.

The  assassins  guild  might  contact  the  characters,

seeking their help in in ltrating a fortress or luring a

target. The assassins dont reveal their true professions

or interests, of course, but that shadowy patron in the

corner of the tavern might have a very good reason for

remaining hidden.

Assassins Guildhouses

Assassins Guildhouses

Unlike thieves, whose guildhouses tend to have a lot

of  traf c,  assassins  often  establish  their  headquarters

in remote locations. If the characters want to visit an

assassins guildhousewhether to invade it or to con-

duct  more  peaceful  businesshere  are  some  places

they might have to go

Mountaintop:  Imagine  a  dungeon  populated  en-

tirely by assassins and their minions. An underground

complex is a natural for assassins, who are usually quite

knowledgeable about traps, poisons, and other staples

of  that  environment.  In  fact,  the  real-world  organiza-

tion  that  gave  assassins  their  name  in  the  eleventh

century was based in a mountain fortress and led by an

Old Man of the Mountain.

65

make  up  for  in   ghting  ability,  unparalleled  stealth,

and access to exotic poisons, weapons, and magic. The

mere threat of retaliation by assassins is enough to dis-

courage many would-be foes.

A second asset is secrecy. Because they would surely

face capital punishment if unmasked as assassins, guild

members take great pains to conceal their operations.

Elaborate  passwords,  blind  drops,  and  hidden  bases

are part of the standard operating procedures, and real

names are never spokeneither to customers or even

to  fellow  members.  Guild  leaders  scrutinize  potential

new members with extreme care to minimize the risk

of in ltration.

Locations: The location of the guilds headquarters

is the biggest secret of all. Assassins take elaborate mea-

sures to ensure that no one follows them back to their

base,  which  could  be  anything  from  an  underground

fortress  to  an  invisible  tower  outside  of  town.  Even

if  someone  should   nd  the  assassins  guild,  getting

inside  is  no  easy  task.  Designed  by  people  for  whom

in ltration is a way of life, it boasts incredible defenses

(see  Assassins  Guildhouses,  below).  Guild  agents  and

members  occasionally  use  other  meeting  places  and

safe houses, but they never meet in the same location

more than once. Assassins know  rsthand what a liabil-

ity predictable movements can be.

Goals:  Since  most  assassins  guilds  are  completely

mercenary operations, their goals are simply to main-

tain  the  veil  of  secrecy,  enrich  their  members,  and

ensure  the  future  survival  of  their  operations.  A  few

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

City  Sewers:  In  larger  cities,  the  sewers  provide

a  second  network  of  streets  for  those  who  wish  to

remain  unseen.  If  the  assassins  have  hollowed  out  a

fortress underneath part of the city, accessing it may be

as simple as sliding aside a street grate and following a

map through the maze of tunnelsmeanwhile avoid-

ing  the  deadly  traps  and  overcoming  the  protective

magic, of course.

Inn: People from all walks of life patronize inns, so its

easy  for  assassins  to  check  in  and  check  out  as  they

receive  new  orders.  Those  needing  the  guilds  services

need only ask the right question of the barkeep or request

a speci c room to make contact. However, patrons who

are not sure theyve earned the assassins trust would be

well advised not to eat the stew.

Church/Temple: In libertine cities, people worship

deities  such  as  Nerull  and  Wee  Jas  openly,  and  their

temples may also be home to assassins guilds. Because

people come and go at all hours, its easy to slip in and

make contact with the guild.

Another  Guildhouse:  Perhaps  the  assassins  guild

has adopted a cover organization and is posing as some

other type of guild. An undertakers guild provides an

excellent  cover,  as  the  guilds  real  jobs  help  to  keep

the  front  organization  in  business.  Alternatively,  the

cover guild could be a completely unrelated one, such

as a cobblers guild. As  long  as  a  suitable  number  of

the assassins in such a guild take ranks in the Craft

(cobbling)  skill,  the  guild  should  have  no  trouble

retaining its cover.

Caravan:  Sometimes  the  best  way  to  avoid  detec-

tion is to stay on the move. Therefore, many assassins

guilds  disguise  their  operations  as  trade  caravans.  Be-

cause headquarters are useful only when theyre avail-

able, such guilds typically restrict their travels to a few

nearby cities. Mobile headquarters are especially popu-

lar among hal ing assassins, who tend to lead nomadic

lifestyles anyway.

Thieves behind the Throne

Thieves behind the Throne

Sometimes  a  thieves  guild  grows  so  powerful  that

its  members  move  beyond  bribing  the  authorities

and  begin  in ltrating,  then  controlling,  entire  power

structures.The leaders of a guild that controls the may-

ors of ce, a few councilors, or the city guard often  nd

themselves  straddling  the  line  between  criminals  and

upstanding citizens.

Organization:  At   rst,  the  organization  of  these

in ltrator guilds mirrors that of their more traditional

counterparts.  Eventually,  however,  the  small  groups

assigned to in ltrate a particular power structure gain

signi cant  in uence  within  both  the  guild  and  the

other organization.

For  example,  suppose  the  thieves  guild  manages

to  get  one  of  its  members  elected  mayor.  That  thief

suddenly gains a great deal of power within the guild,

since any rivals are likely to think twice about crossing

the  person  who  controls  the  city  guard.  In  addition,

the backing of the thieves guild makes it much easier

for that thief to function as mayor. With a word to the

guildmaster, the mayor can make crime in a particular

district  disappear  overnight,  or  increase  it  so  much

that commerce grinds to a halt. In addition, the guilds

espionage  activities  can  produce  enough  blackmail

information  on  the  mayors  political  enemies  to  keep

them at bay inde nitely.

Guild  Rules:  The  rank-and- le  members  of  this

guild operate under the same rules as those who belong

to traditional guilds. Members who are pan of the in-

 ltration operations often draw additional tasksand

commensurate rewards.

Advancement  Opportunities:  Positions  in  the

in ltrated power structure may appear even more en-

ticing than leadership in the guild itself to ambitious

guild  members.  Promotion  to  an  in ltrative  position

requires  impressing  not  only  superiors  within  the

main guild, but also the in ltrators themselves.

Assets: What the guild gets out of this arrangement

depends on what kind of power structure it in ltrates.

Thieves  who  in ltrate  the  army  can   nd  out  about

planned troop movements and gain access to the citys

armories. In ltration of the justice system ensures that

guild  members  avoid  punishment  for  their  crimes

and  that  their  rivals  are  locked  up  for  good.  Finally,

those  who  in ltrate  the  merchants  guilds  know  just

what to steal, how to steal it, and how to pin the blame

on others.

Locations:  In ltrator  guilds  begin  with  the  same

types  of  locations  as  traditional  thieves  guilds  use.

Gradually, however, more and more guild activity oc-

curs wherever the in ltrated organization does its or-

dinary work. Eventually, guild members may become

bold enough to hold meetings in city hall after hours or

fence their goods at a mariners guild warehouse.

Goals:  As  the  thieves  guild  starts  to  enjoy  the  ben-

e ts  of  secretly  controlling  some  power  structure,  its

members devote more and more of their energy to two

efforts:  keeping  that  control  secret  and  strengthening

the other organization.

Con  icts: The essential con ict in a power behind

the  throne  situation  is  one  of  resources.  How  much

of the guilds wealth and manpower should go toward

maintaining  the  in ltrated  power  structure,  and  how

much toward continuing traditional thieves guild ac-

tivities?  At  some  point,  controlling  a  power  structure

from the shadows is likely to put a crimp in a guilds

regular  activities.  For  example,  when  the  guild-af li-

ated  mayor  shuts  down  crime  in  a  particular  area  to

win over an important ally, the thieves who normally

work there lose income. The fact that they cant even

retaliate can foment a con ict that throws the entire

guild into disarray.

Another type of con ict may occur between the guild

and the citys remaining power groups, especially those

66

CHAPTER 4:ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

that are more resistant to in ltration, such as churches.

Whether the leaders of such organizations know that

thieves are secretly running the show or not, they often

end up blocking the guilds carefully laid plans.

Hooks:  Perhaps  a  thieves  guild  has  controlled  the

mayors of ce for so long that it now devotes nearly all its

efforts to running the city and almost none to thieving.

Such a city, with a thieves guild that has gradually gone

legit, is rife for the formation of a second thieves guild.

Anyone who actually tries to build one, though, is in for

a tough  ght.

An alderman or watch captain might hire the char-

acters to  nd out whos really pulling the strings in the

city. Alternatively, the leaders of the thieves guild may

ask the characters to play a role in the actual in ltra-

tion process.

One of the characters worked for an in ltrator guild in

the past but grew frustrated with its political maneuver-

ing and left for a life of adventure.

Spy Network

Spy Network

In some cities, the most valuable commodity is infor-

mation. And who can provide that better than a group

of stealthy, skilled individuals with utter contempt for

privacy?

Organization:  Thieves  guilds  that  focus  on  selling

information often build their internal structures around

their sources. For instance, one division of such a guild

might  focus  on  in ltrating  noble  households,  while

another concentrates on merchants guildhouses. Each

division has a leader, who in turn serves on a council that

either advises an overall guildmaster or administers the

guild as a group.

High-level  guild  members  do  very  little  informa-

tion-gathering.  Instead,  they  collate  and  analyze  the

data that junior members have acquired, then sell their

conclusions to the parties most likely to pro t from the

knowledge. For example, one team might uncover the

fact that a particular merchant has been gambling a lot

lately, while another might discover a series of unusu-

ally vague customs declarations on that same merchants

shipping documents. The analyst who sees both scraps

of information then rushes to the merchants rival to sell

a tale about a bad gambler whos turned to smuggling to

pay off debts.

Guild  Rules:  The  most  important  rule  for  an  infor-

mation-gatherer is full disclosure. Members of a spy net-

work must report every detail that seems out of place

no matter how minorin the places they monitor.

Advancement Opportunities: Guild leaders assign

new  members  to  teams  based  on  their  aptitudes  and

interests. Although its possible to switch teams, most

thieves  stick  with  their  original  placements.  Those

wishing to become analysts must spend a set amount of

time in the  eld  rst.

Assets:  Information  is,  of  course,  the  biggest  asset

this guild has, but the organization also bene ts from

a divergent membership. Many of its members begin

as rogues, then later adopt the spymaster prestige class.

Wizards and sorcerers can  nd steady work here too,

as  can  the  occasional  silver-tongued  bard.  In  addi-

tion,  a  typical  spy  network  has  beggars,  merchants,

priests, and even nobles in its ranks. Because most of

its members dont  t the traditional mold of thieves,

they  are  unlikely  to  come  under  suspicion  should

trouble arise.

Locations: Information is useless if it doesnt reach

the  right  ears.  Therefore,  this  organization  builds  an

elaborate  network  of  meeting  places  and  letter  drops

to  ensure  that  all  information  gathered  reaches  the

guild  leadership.  Every  member  knows  a  half  dozen

secret alcoves, password-protected rooms at inns, and

midnight  rendezvous  pointsand  when  to  use  each

one. The guildhouse itself is often in some secret loca-

tion within the cityeither underground or disguised

with a cover business.

Goals: An information-oriented guild needs frequent

shakeups in the citys status quo to thrive. After all, in-

formation is valuable only if it represents a change from

whats generally known. Few are willing to pay just to

have their beliefs con rmed.

Con  icts: This guild comes into con ict with anyone

who has a secretand in a large city, thats almost any-

one with power. Guild leaders rarely take such con icts

seriously,  however,  since  they  routinely  sell  secrets  to

the same groups from which theyve stolen others.

Hooks:  A  player  character  involved  with  city  poli-

tics may get a tip that the thieves guild is the place to

go for din on a rival. In exchange for this information,

the thieves guild may want cash, information in trade,

or a service, such as an unusual in ltration job.

If the characters have reputations of their own, the

guild may try to learn information about them. Imag-

ine the adventurers surprise when they discover that

one of their hirelings is nowhere to be found, and the

enemy knows every spell in the wizards spellbook.

Bard and rogue characters may have trained within

a  spy  network,  then  left  the  city  in  search  of  greater

secrets, such as the ones buried in long-lost tombs and

dungeons.

Smuggler Cartel

Smuggler Cartel

Some  cities  restrict  trade  in  certain  goods  for  social,

political,  or  religious  reasons.  Wine,  magic  items,

weapons, or even the written word might be forbidden

within a particular citys walls. But wherever a demand

exists, someone always steps up to provide a supply. In

many cases, the local thieves guild is that supplier.

Organization: A smuggler cartel typically has three

divisions:  acquisitions,  traf cking,  and  sales.  Those

in  acquisitions  work  outside  the  city  walls  to  obtain

illicit  goods.  Accomplishing  this  may  be  as  simple  as

purchasing the desired merchandise in another area or

as complex as manufacturing it in secret or acquiring it

67

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

illegally. The traf ckers then move the merchandise in-

side the city walls. These are the classic smugglers, who

hide their wares in barrels with false bottoms or sneak

them into the city through long-forgotten sewer tunnels.

Finally, the sales division sets up black markets to sell

the contraband. Its a tricky task to let customers know

where  they  can  buy  illegal  goods  without  telling  law

enforcement agents as well.

Each of these divisions has a leader and one or more

subleaders.  These  upper-level  operators  ensure  the

smooth transfer of goods from one division to another

and  work  together  to  address  any  complications.  The

cartel may or may not have an overall leader.

Guild  Rules:  Members  of  a  smuggler  cartel  are

assigned  tasks,  but  they  generally  have  considerably

more  freedom  in  how  to  proceed  than  their  counter-

parts in other guilds do. As long as they dont interfere

with other parts of the operation, the end result is what

countsnot the means.

Advancement  Opportunities:  New  members  can

usually choose a division to join, but transfers are com-

mon. Promotion to the upper ranks requires innovation,

such  as  discovering  a  new  and  cheaper  source  of  the

desired goods.

Assets:  A  strong  network  of  smugglers  that  can

circumvent  the  authorities  at  every  turn  is  this  guilds

strongest asset. If the network is ef cient and safe, the

guild  thrives,  but  if  its  operations  become  costly  and

risky, smuggling may become a losing proposition.

Access to the contraband itself can also be an asset if the

illegal items are particularly useful. In a city that prohibits

magic, for example, the smugglers who sell magic items

are powerful indeed, since they have more magic at their

disposal than anyone else does.

Locations:  Unlike  most  thieves  guilds,  smuggler

cartels  do  much  of  their  business  outside  the  city

limits. Therefore, their bases tend to be scattered over

wide areas. However, such a guild does need at least

one  base  within  the  citya  front  shop,  midnight

bazaar, or nondescript warehouse, perhapsfor sell-

ing the illicit goods.

Goals:  Smugglers  are  always  looking  for  new

sources of contraband and new ways to sneak it into

the  city.  Even  if  they  have  reliable  channels,  they

still need backups to ensure that they wont be out of

business if something goes awry. Furthermore, black

markets  rely  on  monopoly  pricing,  so  the  leaders  of

a smuggler cartel work aggressively to eliminate any

rival bootleggers.

Con  icts: This guilds primary con ict is with law

enforcement. The city guard may interrogate captured

smugglers to uncover all the links in a supply chain, or

even send undercover agents to buy goods in a sting

operation.

Smuggler cartels can also face unusual problems with

suppliers.  Perhaps  a  grape  blight  threatens  the  guilds

lucrative wine smuggling, or the dwarves refuse to sell

weapons  to  guild  representatives.  Even  the  most  ef -

cient network cant turn a pro t if theres no contraband

to be had.

Hooks: The local cartel hires the characters to smug-

gle  cargo  into  the  cityor  arranges  for  them  to  do  so

unwittingly.

If  the  characters  need  contraband  goods,  they  must

 nd the cartel, convince its representative that they arent

undercover agents, and complete the transaction without

alerting  the  local  law  enforcers.  If  they  need  to  sneak

something  else  (perhaps  even  themselves)  into  or  out

of the city, the smuggler cartel may be the best ally they

could hope for.

The  characters  may  have  some  connection  with  a

cartels  suppliers  outside  the  city.  For  example,  suppose

a  merchant  friendly  with  the  characters  has  a  problem

getting herb shipments safely to their destinations. Upon

investigation, the party discovers that a dread pirate in the

pay of the cartel is stealing them, then smuggling them

into a strict jurisdiction.

Random Contraband

Youve just defeated the smuggler. When you open the

crates he was taking through the city sewers, what do

you  nd?

The following table represents typical types of con-

traband that might be smuggled into a lawful good or

lawful neutral city. Many of the substances here arent

forbidden so much as taxed and controlled. The black

marketeers  sell  to  those  who  wish  to  avoid  the  tax

burden and of cial scrutiny that acquiring these goods

legally would entail.

Thieves War!

Thieves War!

Why have one thieves guild when you can have two or

more? In some cities, the thieves have split into several

factions,  each  with  its  own  guild.  Of  course,  peaceful

coexistence among multiple thieves guilds is unlikely.

68

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

Each  guild  equips  special  teams  of  thieves  to  hunt

down members of the rival organization, which results

in ongoing battles from shadow to shadow and rooftop

to rooftop.

Organization: Each guild in this type of con ict has

its own structure, which mimics one of the other types

detailed  in  this  section.  Its  unlikely  that  two  parallel

thieves guilds would evolve in the same city at the same

time, so the warring guilds are usually of different types.

Two similar guilds are possible, however, if a leadership

struggle  in  a  monolithic  thieves  guild  has  resulted  in

the breakup of the organization. In that case, the factions

would start out with the same protocols and styles but

quickly diverge.

Guild Rules: Loyalty is the most important element

in a guild war. Even when members are under constant

scrutiny, betrayals are common.

Advancement Opportunities: Advancing in rank is

often easier in this situation than it is when a town has

only one guild. War causes attrition in both guilds ranks,

so openings are common. Of course, some thieves try to

advance by switching sides and offering the enemy infor-

mation, but this is particularly riskyno one really trusts

a traitor.

Assets: The primary asset for either side in an ongoing

thieves war is armament. Every thief on the street must

be  better  armed  than  in  peacetime,  or  the  pro ts  from

jobs may never make it back to the guildhouse. Not only

must thieves hide their activities from law enforcers, but

also from members of the rival guild, who would be more

than happy to raise an alarm, ruin a job, or even attack if

they spotted their enemies at work.

Locations: If the guilds are truly separate, each has the

same sorts of bases it otherwise would. If a single thieves

guild has split into warring factions, however, most of the

splinter groups quickly establish their own small, secret

bases and hideouts.

Goals: Most factions in a thieves war share one goal:

Wipe out the other factions and become the only thieves

guild  in  the  city.  However,  small  factions  may  simply

want to survive, or a losing faction might want to move

to another city where the pickings are easier. (Of course,

such a relocation could result in con ict with the thieves

guild in the new city.)

Con  icts:  The  primary  con ict  each  guild  faces  in

this  situation  is  with  rival  guilds,  of  course,  but  all  the

usual  pressures  are  still  present  as  well.  Law  enforce-

ment  doesnt  stop  just  because  the  thieves  are  killing

each  other,  and  merchants  and  nobles  remain  just  as

committed to protecting their riches. Finally, a thieves

guild that splintered once can certainly do so again. Just

because a thieves war is raging doesnt mean that every

guild member has put away all grudges and rivalries.

Hooks:  The  characters   nd  themselves  allied  (on

purpose or through circumstance) with one faction in

a thieves war. This, of course, draws attacks from the

other factions.

Characters might not realize that theres more than

one faction of thieves in a city. When they describe the

habits  of  one  thief  to  a  member  of  a  rival  guild,  they

might  unwittingly  ignite  a  new  battle  in  the  thieves

warand  nd themselves in the cross re.

A beginning character might decide to adopt the life

of an adventurer after her mentors  nd themselves on

the losing end of a thieves war.

Monster-Based Guild

Monster-Based Guild

Thieves  guilds  operate  from  the  shadows,  and  their

leaders  rarely  see  the  light  of  day.  That  makes  guild

leadership a perfect vehicle for a spectre (or any other

monster wishing to in uence city dwellers) to use in

accomplishing its goals. Another such guild is the type

dominated  by  members  of  one  humanoid  race.  Like

all guilds, a monster-based guild typically takes on the

characteristics of its members.

Organization:  A  guild  dominated  by  a  particular

racial  or  monster  type  has  either  a  traditional  guild

structure  or  one  that  re ects  the  society  of  the  crea-

tures  involved.  Dwarf-dominated  thieves  guilds,  for

example,  are  organized  into  clans  with  hereditary

leaders.  A  thieves  guild  run  by  mind   ayers,  on  the

other  hand,  might  rely  on  enthralled  slaves  and  have

an illithid elder brain for a guildmaster.

Guild Rules: The activities stressed or forbidden by

a  guild  of  this  type  re ect  the  nature  of  the  dominant

members and the ulterior motives (if any) of its leaders.

Advancement Opportunities: As with most other

guilds, moving up in the ranks requires impressing the

leaders. What exactly that entails depends on the goals

of the creatures involved.

Assets:  The  key  assets  for  this  guild  are  the  unusual

abilities of its members. Shadows, for example, are totally

silent,  so  they  can  glide  into  almost  any  building  and

eavesdrop. (They leave the actual thieving to other guild

members, however, since they cant pick up solid objects.)

An all-kobold thieves guild might have a number of sor-

cerers in its ranks, and an elven guild would approach its

political moves with the patience of thieves who can af-

ford to case a location for decades.

Locations: Because few cities have large populations

of  unusual  creatures,  the  leaders  of  a  monster-based

thieves  guild  take  extra  pains  to  provide  a  safe  haven

where  members  can  live  when  not  actually  thieving.

Many  monsters  favor  underground  locations,  although

any secret place works. Some creatures (doppelgangers,

for example) dont require anything special in terms of

a hideout because hiding is part of their nature. A guild

dominated by a single race, on the other hand, usually has

locations that  t its members heritage. Hal ing guilds,

for  example,  are  more  mobile  than  their  traditional

counterparts,  so  their  leaders  often  disguise  their  guild

headquarters as trade caravans.

Goals: Most monster-based thieves guilds have the

same goals as their human-centered counterparts: Get

69

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

rich, avoid detection, and strengthen the membership.

Occasionally, however, a guild is just part of some larger

effort. For example, forming a thieves guild of wererats

might be the  rst step in a dark plan to infect an entire

city with lycanthropy.

Con  icts: A monster-based guild faces great danger if

its true nature is revealed. While an active thieves guild

is an annoyance to city leaders, a thieves guild run by a

beholder is a grave threateven if the guild itself isnt as

strong as a traditional one.

A guild dominated by a single race, on the other hand,

faces  pressure  from  that  races  enemies.  A  drow-based

thieves  guild,  for  example,  might   nd  itself  beset  by

magically disguised driders eager to kill all the drow they

can  nd.

Hooks: The characters have received several lucra-

tive jobs from the local thieves guild, only to learn that

its led by a clan of vampires. They must turn the tables

on the guild before they wind up as meals.

Characters who come into con ict with monsters in

the wilderness might discover that their opponents have

been receiving aid from a nearby city. Investigation re-

veals the truth about the thieves guild leadership.

A monster PC has learned to interact better with civi-

lized races by operating as an agent of a monster-based

thieves guild.

Remnant Guilds and New Guilds

Remnant Guilds and New Guilds

Sometimes  law  enforcement  wins.  Running  a  thieves

guild is a high-risk operation, and occasionally it doesnt

succeed. Even if the authorities do manage to stamp out

a thieves guild, however, a small remnant of it usually

remains at large. In those rare cases when destruction is

total, someone from outside the city eventually moves in

to set up a new guild.

Organization:  Remnant  and  new  guilds  typically

consist of one leader with as many followers as he or

she  can  personally  direct.  These  small  guilds  rarely

take  on  more  than  one  or  two  projects  at  once,  and

many heists involve the entire membership. Depend-

ing  on  how  the  guild  was  formed,  it  may  or  may  not

have a criminal specialty. If only the deep-cover thieves

survived a purge, the remnant guild might focus exclu-

sively on espionage and information brokering. Mem-

bers  of  a  totally  new  guild,  on  the  other  hand,  might

have a more or less random assortment of skills and try

a number of different crimes.

Guild Rules: Remnant and new guilds are generally

more  permissive  than  their  better-established  counter-

parts. Overall, however, their rules are similar to those of

established guilds with the same business models.

Advancement Opportunities: In a small guild, ad-

ditional leadership is welcome only when membership

expands enough to warrant it. Therefore, those who ag-

gressively recruit new members are the best candidates

for advancement.

Assets: These guilds lack many of the resources that

established guilds have. Their leaders arent rich, they

dont  have  extensive  contacts  in  the  community,  and

they  dont  have  the  personnel  to  carry  out  big  jobs.

But  sometimes  small  size  is  an  asset.  Small  groups

have an easier time hiding than large ones, and trust

comes  more  easily  when  leaders  know  every  guild

member personally.

Locations: A new guild usually cant afford a secret

headquarters, so the members often meet in a tavern,

private  residence,  or  abandoned  building  instead.  As

the  guild  grows,  its  leader  expends  some  effort  to

acquire and equip a proper hideout. A remnant guild

may  still  have  access  to  all  the  structures  the  former

guild had, although its members must be careful about

using themmany of the old hideouts arent as secret

as they once were.

Goals:  Recruiting  new  members  is  a  major  goal  for

remnant  and  new  guilds.  Since  they  are  too  small  to

use join or die recruiting tactics effectively, most offer

incentives  of  some  type.  Typically,  the  leader  of  such

a  guild  reduces  the  required  percentage  of  the  take  to

make  membership  more  attractive,  then  gradually  in-

creases  it  as  the  guilds  ranks  grow.  Some  also  offer  to

help experienced freelancers with jobs. The guilds assis-

tance earns it a portion of the take, spreads the word of

its existence in the underworld community, and might

even convince the freelancer to join.

A small guild spends what money it earns to buy in u-

ence  and  favors  from  law  enforcement  and  the  justice

system. Rather than building a vast underground fortress,

its  leaders  bribe  watch  sergeants  and  pay  for  blackmail

information  against  judges.  The  money  spent  on  such

efforts ensures that a city guard crackdown wont put the

entire guild membership in jail.

Con  icts: Remnant and new guilds have to struggle

mightily  against  law  enforcement  just  to  keep  their

members  heads  out  of  nooses.  Guild  members  may

wind up  ghting the citys freelance thieves, who see

an organized group as unwelcome competition. Even

worse, personality con icts among the founders tend

to destroy more new guilds than even the most zealous

city guard can.

Hooks:  Characters  eager  to  earn  their  reputations

might  seek  to  found  a  new  thieves  guild  in  a  city

thats temporarily without one. Alternatively, city lead-

ers  might  hire  them  to  stamp  out  a  rapidly  growing

thieves guild.

When  the  thieves  guild  in  an  important  city  was

crushed, some of its secrets died with it. Characters in

search  of  answers  to  a  particularly  vexing  problem  or

puzzle may have to  nd the remnant thieves guild and

get the truth out of its membersone way or another.

A new character is the sole survivor of the local guild.

Now shes on the run from the law and always looking

over her shoulder.

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

BARDIC COLLEGES

Though thieves guilds hold sway within the walls of

individual cities, bards often form organizations that

transcend  local  and  national  boundaries.  Some  such

bardic  colleges  establish  centers  of  learning  in  ma-

jor  cities  so  that  experienced  bards  can  impart  their

knowledge to interested students in formal, academic

settings.  More  loosely  organized  colleges  favor  sim-

ple, master-apprentice relationships for passing along

lore.  Whatever  the  format,  however,  colleges  enable

bards who are interested in a particular area of study

to discuss new business, debate contested topics, and

unveil new discoveries.

Of course, not every bard is a member of a college, and

no college restricts its membership to bards alone. But

many bards received at least their initial training from

someone af liated with a college, and bards make up the

governing bodies of most colleges.

College of Concrescent Lore

College of Concrescent Lore

This bardic college, one of the largest in existence, fo-

cuses on the acquisition of hidden lore, particularly of

the historical or magical variety. Its members eagerly

page through dusty tomes, seeking to uncover secrets

about long-dead societies, strange magical rituals, and

other unusual topics.

Area  of  Study:  History  and  magical  lore  are  the

bread and butter of this college. Many of the worlds

greatest historians are at least adjunct members, and

several powerful wizards have joined the college to

gain  access  to  its  texts  on  magic.  The  study  of  his-

tory  here  has  an  archeological  bent,  and  members

focus  on  understanding  the  languages,

architecture,  rituals,  and  leaders  of  lost

civilizations.

Organization:  A  council  of  three

administrators runs this college. Each

has  been  a  member  for  at  least  ten

years  and  embraced  at  least  three

 elds  of  study  during  that  time.

These three no longer do active

research;  instead,  they  review

others   ndings,  distribute

reports,  and  maintain  the

membership list.

Activities:  Each  mem-

ber  chooses  an  area  of

knowledge  (such  as  The

Second  Empire  of  Qir-

taia  or  Vordhavian  Death

Magic)  as  a  specialty  upon

entering  the  college,  but

this choice can be changed as often as once a year. The

administrators update the list of members and specialties

annually and circulate that document, called a yearbook,

to the current membership.

All signi cant member  ndings, from new discover-

ies  to  the  results  of  long-term  studies,  are  circulated

to  colleagues  with  relevant  specialties.  Thus,  a  Con-

crescent  Lorist  who  specializes  in  Kreidikan  history

might receive  eld notes from an expedition to a newly

discovered Kreidikan ruin, a translation of a poem that

mentions a Kreidikan sorcerer-king, and a fragment of

the fountain of blood spell that Kreidikan mages favor, all

in the same month. Exactly who receives the results of

particularly important research is currently the subject

of bitter debate, howeversome researchers are livid

because  they  did  not  receive  copies  of  studies  they

thought were vital to their own research. The college

also has a strict policy that prohibits sharing research

results with anyone outside the college. Centuries ago,

this no eyes but the learned policy caused a split in

the organization that led to the formation of the Tales-

pinners League (see below).

Distinctions:  Until  we  accumulate  in nity  is  the

colleges motto. Concrescent Lorists wear dark robes with

red stripes encircling the upper sleeves.

Admission:  Candidates  for  membership  must  pass

a  series  of  examinations  to  gain  admission.  Each  test

is  unique,  composed  of  questions  posed  by  collegians

with specialties similar to the one the candidate has re-

quested. Because those who contribute to the test tend to

be widely scattered, it can take months for the college to

prepare an exam and even longer for the contributors to

grade it. Those who contributed test questions have the

sole  authority  to  admit  the  candidate,  and  particularly

petty collegians have been known to create unthinkably

dif cult  questions  just  to  keep  new  blood  out  of  their

favorite disciplines.

Passing a typical examination requires speci c

knowledge of ones specialty. The

applicant must make three suc-

cessful  skill  checks:  Knowledge

(arcana)  (DC  25),  Knowledge

(history) (DC 25), and either

Knowledge  (architecture)  or

Knowledge  (geography)  (DC

15).  In  addition,  the  candidate

must be able to read and write at

least  one  obscure  language.  Re-

tries are allowed, but only to apply

for a different specialty.

The  initial  membership  fee  is  500

gp, which goes to pay for the creation

and grading of the test.

Membership  Bene  ts:  The  greatest

advantage to membership in this college is

access to the volumes of research its mem-

bers produce each year. Unless theyve some-

how  made  enemies  among  their  colleagues,

members  can  count  on  receiving  advance  word  of

every discovery made in their  elds.

71

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

Members with speci c questions also have the right

to  query  members  outside  their  own  specialties  for

information.  Answering  such  a  query  is  rarely  a  high

priority,  however,  especially  if  no  reason  is  given  for

the request.

Dues: Annual dues are 250 gp, but active collegians

spend  much  more  than  this  on  their  research,  corre-

spondence with other members, and occasional regional

meetings.

Relations: The College of Concrescent Lore maintains

a  friendly  rivalry  with  the  College  of  Arcanobiological

Studies  and  a  not-so-friendly  rivalry  with  the  Talespin-

ners League. However, Concrescent Lorists give the cold

shoulder  to  wizards  who  just  want  to  copy  down  our

books for the spells, not to learn anything.

Talespinners League

Talespinners League

Centuries ago, some members of the College of Con-

crescent  Lore  objected  on  philosophical  grounds  to

the organizations secretive approach to information.

Their desire to share information with outsiders liter-

ally tore the college in two. The disaffected members

formed the Talespinners League, a college devoted to

the free  ow of information. Since that time, League

members  have  honed  their  performance  skills  and

branched out beyond the history and arcana studies

that  Concrescent  Lorists  favor.  Many  Talespinners

are  bards,  but  occasional  arcane  spellcasters  are  also

welcomeespecially if they are members of the vir-

tuoso prestige class.

Area of Study: The Talespinners League collects ev-

ery kind of lore imaginable. Not as academic as the Con-

crescent Lorists, Talespinners study down-to-earth topics

such as the everyday traditions of various cultures.

Organization:  The  Talespinners  League  is  based

on  the  masterapprentice  relationship.  New  students

learn lore from masters and eventually become masters

themselves.  The  masters  in  each  region  meet  once  or

twice  a  year  and  make  any  necessary  decisions  by  a

simple  majority  vote.  (Usually  there  arent  many  press-

ing issues because League members tend not to involve

themselves with politics.) Once that part is over, other in-

vited members arrive, and the meeting becomes a grand

exercise in tale-swapping. Each member who attends is

expected as a matter of courtesy to share (via a tale) any

new  lore  uncovered  since  the  last  meeting.  Keeping

secrets  is  against  the  Leagues  code  of  conduct,  but  the

only penalty for doing so is a lack of tales to tell at the

regional meeting. Secretive or troublesome Talespinners

are rarely booted out of the Leaguethey just dont get

invitations to future meetings, and the rest of the college

learns to ignore them.

Activities: Members spend time collecting all kinds of

lore. Rather than relying on academic reports to disperse

it,  the  League  embeds  its  lore  within  historical  or   cti-

tious tales. Any member is free to specialize if desired but

can change specialties at a moments notice.

72

Distinctions:  The  Leagues  motto  is:  The  heart  of

the tale is in the telling. Talespinners dont wear robes,

but many add blue and white tassels to their clothing.

Admission:  Because  the  Talespinners  League  is

nothing more than chains of masters and apprentices,

the only prerequisite for membership is gaining a men-

tor  who  is  a  member  of  the  League.  To  achieve  this,

the  candidate  must  tell  the  prospective  mentor  three

tales, making a successful Perform check (DC 25) for

each. One story must be about the candidate, one about

a  stranger,  and  the  third  about  one  of  the  candidates

friends.  Choosing  tales  particularly  suited  to  the  lis-

tener  (DMs  discretion)  is  worth  a  +2  circumstance

bonus on the check. A candidate who fails to impress

one mentor can try again with another if desired.

Once  the  candidate  is  accepted,  the  apprenticeship

proceeds  entirely  at  the  mentors  whim.  The  process

typically lasts for several months and involves learning

new tales and performance techniques. The apprentice

earns the title Master Talespinner at the mentors dis-

cretion. Only a Talespinner who has been a master for

at least  ve years can take on apprentices.

Membership Bene  ts: The biggest bene t to mem-

bership is access to the colleges treasure trove of lore. Its

free  for  the  asking,  because  Talespinners  love  nothing

more  than  to  exchange  stories  of  far-off  lands,  arcane

enigmas, and mysterious creatures. Unlike their academ-

ic rivals, however, Talespinners lack any organized means

of cataloging their lore. Thus, an apprentices query about

a particular item might produce the following sort of re-

ply: A few years back, someone at the northern meeting

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

mentioned such a jade statue. But I cant recall who it

was. Kardalius over in Baselton might remember who

told such a tale....

Talespinners  tend  to  travel  more  than  their  more

academic counterparts, and they eagerly swap tales and

render assistance to fellow collegians, recognizing them

by the blue and white tassels they wear. Clever innkeep-

ers look for the tassels, too. and many offer discounts to

Talespinners who are willing to spin yarns by the  re.

Dues:  The  Talespinners  League  has  no  of cial  ad-

mission  fee.  However,  mentors  have  been  known

to  hint  that  a  suitably  expensive  gift  speeds  the

application process along.

Relations:  Talespinners  regard  the  Concrescent

Lorists  with  contempt  for  wanting  to  keep  the  most

interesting items in the world locked up for their private

little club. Because they travel a great deal, Talespinners

are generally cordial toward members of the League of

Boot and Trail. In addition, they love to quiz adventurers

about the perils theyve faced.

College of Arcanobiological Studies

College of Arcanobiological Studies

Unlike  the  Talespinners  League,  the  College  of  Ar-

canobiological Studies has a narrow focus: the study

of the monsters that inhabit the worlds vast wilder-

nesses. Whether they work from the con nes of their

laboratories  or  the  expanse  of  unmapped  territories,

Arcanobiologists are determined to learn all they can

about the strangest creatures the world has to offer.

Area  of  Study:  Though  this  college  considers  any

nonhumanoid monster worthy of study, each member

tends  to  focus  on  either  one  kind  of  creature  (such  as

nagas or sphinxes) or one aspect of monsters in general

(such  as  internal  anatomy  or  lair  selection).  Some  Ar-

canobiologists spend their time in laboratories, dissect-

ing specimens and breeding creatures in captivity. Oth-

ers go out into the  eld to track and observe creatures in

their natural habitats.

Organization:  The  College  of  Arcanobiological

Studies consists of many schools, each devoted to a par-

ticular specialty, but theres no rhyme or reason to these

divisions.Some schools focus on all aspects of a certain

creature type, while others study behaviors common to

many creatures. Thus, two different researchersone

from the school of chimeras and one from the school

of reproductionmight both have reason to observe a

mother chimeras lair.

Fourteen  regents  attempt  to  make  sense  of  this

colleges dozens of schools. These former researchers ad-

minister the colleges entrance examinations, decide on

promotions  and  transfers,  and  seek  funds  from  nobles

and  kings  to  continue  research.  Turnover  among  the

regents is highafter a few years of management, most

regents  are  eager  to  get  back  to  their  laboratories  and

 eld-blinds.

Activities:  Unlike  many  of  the  other  colleges,  the

College  of  Arcanobiological  Studies  actively  solicits

work from nobles and rulers who want to know more

about the creatures within their lands. For example, a

noble  might  want  to  know  how  to  drive  off  wyverns

in the nearby forest without arousing their ire, or why

the cattle in the Southern Dale keep disappearing. The

regents   eld  such  requests,  negotiate  payment,  then

assign  Arcanobiologists  of  the  appropriate  specialties

to do the work. Most Arcanobiologists get at least one

project a year this way.

Distinctions:  The  colleges  motto  is  To  know

them  is  to  know  ourselves,  although  most  members

of the college would be hard-pressed to remember it.

An  Arcanobiologist  is  likely  to  wear  a  brass  armband

festooned with a few scales, a feather, or a patch of fur

from the creature he or she studies.

Admission:  To  be  accepted  into  the  college,  a  can-

didate  must  pass  a  written  exam  that  covers  the   eld

broadly  but  does  not  delve  into  speci cs.  A  successful

Knowledge (nature) check (DC 20) passes the test. A 250-

gp fee is required to take the test, which is offered once

a  year  in  the  spring.  A  new  Arcanobiologist  may  work

under a mentor for the  rst two years if desired.

Membership  Bene  ts:  As  with  many  of  the  other

colleges,  the  primary  asset  this  one  has  is  its  collected

knowledge. Collegians are generally forthcoming about

their discoveries, but theyre sticklers for proper attribu-

tion. If Orized the Younger  rst observed how dragons

sharpen their claws, its considered a breach of protocol

not to mention him by name when discussing the topic.

Rivalries sometimes emerge between two Arcanobiolo-

gists who both claim the same discovery, but thats an-

other problem for the regents to settle.

Dues: Each member must pay annual dues of 500 gp.

Relations:  In  general,  Arcanobiologists  get  along

well with members of other academic colleges, such as

the College of Concrescent Lore and the Conservatory

of  the  Ineffable  Chord.  Intelligent  creatures  who  are

the subjects of an Arcanobiologists study react with at-

titudes that range from amusement to enmity. For ex-

ample, phasms  nd the attention  attering, but lamias

want to dissect the dissectors.

Lamenters Order

Lamenters Order

The  members  of  this  college  study  death:  how  people

prepare for it, what occurs at the moment it happens, and

how the survivors grieve afterward. Some Lamenters are

passive  observers,  awaiting  their  own  opportunities  to

study lifes greatest mystery. Others do more active re-

search by hastening the end for those they would study.

Understandably, such Lamenters have given the entire

college an unsavory reputation.

Area of Study: This college began as a musical one

devoted  to  the  creation  and  performance  of  funeral

music. Its members were sought out to provide dirges

and tribute-songs for funerals in many lands. Eventual-

ly, Lamenters began to study the nature of death itself,

hoping that a greater understanding of it would provide

73

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

Inspiration for their music. In time, however, these

studies eclipsed the musical aspect of the college. Thus,

some of the colleges current members have no musical

skills at all.

Organization:  Because  outsiders  distrust  them  so

much,  Lamenters  keep  the  identities  of  their  leaders

secret.  A  shadowy   gure  called  the  Lord  of  Shrouds

runs the college. Several regional Lords of Ash provide

assistance by distributing news, jobs, and new songs to

local members. Reporting to the Lords of Ash are four

other levels of Lamenters. Ranked from highest to low-

est, these are Mercybringers, Shrouders, Grievers, and

Comforters. These ranks matter only for tasks assigned

by  senior  Lamenters  (see  below).  Each

Lord  of  Ash  also  has  several  underlings

who   eld  commissions  for  memorial

ballads and dirges from wealthy patrons.

These requests are passed on to individual

Lamenters,  who  negotiate  payment  on

their own.

Activities: Members of the college can

undertake  whatever  studies  they  wish.

Most  Lamenters  are  keenly  interested  in

how different people react at the moment

of death, and how a persons passing affects

friends,  family,  colleagues,  and  enemies.

Thus,  Lamenters  go  to  great  lengths  to

be present when someone notable passes

away,  and  many  are  eager  to  accompany

soldiers, adventurers, and others who face

death  on  a  daily  basis.  Some  Lamenters

even go as far as to betray or poison some-

one just to observe the moment of death.

Others seek to part the veil of death itself

in search of immortality or a way to bring

back a lost loved one.

Distinctions:  The  motto  of  the  La-

menters Order is simple: We watch.

Ranks of the Watchers

for the Coming Sunset

The following are the names of

the  ranks  within  the  Watchers

for  the  Coming  Sunset  college.

They  are  listed  from  lowest  to

highest.

Calm amid the Storm

Proof against Mayhem

Planter of the New Seed

Guardian of the Day to Come

Candle amid the Darkness

Beholder of the In nite

Doombane

Bringer of Solace

Denier of Fate

Shield to the Unknowing

Flower among the Ruins

Craver of Tomorrow

Walker of the Mystery-Path

Shepherd to All

He (or She) Who Does Not Yield

Admission:  To  join  the  Lamenters,  a

character  must  pass  one  of  three  exams.

To pass the Test of Consolation, which involves writ-

ing and singing an original dirge, the candidate must

make a successful Perform check (DC 30). The Test of

Icy Pallor requires the applicant to survive an injection

of wyvern poison without magical aid. To pass the Test

of  the  Unending  Stare,  which  involves  describing  in

detail  the  physiological  effects  of  death,  the  candi-

date  needs  a  successful  Heal  check  (DC  30).  Rumors

abound of a fourth test requiring the assassination of a

public  gure, but no Lamenter has ever admitted that

such a test exists.

Each test costs 1,500 gp to take. Retries are permitted

without restriction at the same cost.

Membership  Bene  ts:  Lamenters  have  access  to

the  organizations  death  lore  and  relics,  including  a

number of remarkably deadly spells and magic items.

They  also  have  ready  access  to  various  poisons  and

74

necromantic magic. All members receive training in

poison  use,  so  they  never  accidentally  poison  them-

selves  (see  the  Poison  section  in  Chapter  3  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Members  of  the  college  spare  no  effort  to  have  a

colleague who has died through accident or misadven-

ture raised from the dead, so that others can learn from

the death experience of their colleague.

Dues: Lamenters must give 20% of the fees they col-

lect for commissioned songs to the college. In addition,

each  Lamenter  occasionally  receives  an  assignment

from  a  senior  member.  This  can  be  as  innocuous  as

commissioning a song or as sinister as performing an

assassination. Successfully carrying out the assignment

earns the Lamenter a promotion within the ranks of the

college and payment from the senior Lamenter; failure

means expulsion.

Relations:  Most  organizations  hold  Lamenters  at

arms  length.  This  college  has  ties  with  clerics  and

necromancers, of course, and its members often know

how to contact assassins.

Watchers for the Coming Sunset

Watchers for the Coming Sunset

Members of this college study one rather esoteric subject:

apocalypses. They seek out signs that the end of the world

is coming and pore over ancient prophecies in search of

ways to prevent certain doom.

Area of Study: The Watchers began as an academic

group studying various cultures myths about the end of

the world. From there, its researchers branched out into

examining  the  demise  of  past  civilizations,  the  role  of

deities in the end of the world, and how powerful magic

could result in vast destruction.

Organization: Fifteen ranks exist within the college

of  the  Watchers  for  the  Coming  Sunset  (see  sidebar).

These  ranks  rarely  have  speci c  duties  attached  to

them; they merely establish hierarchy and accord status.

Members  receive  promotions  by  bringing  new  apoca-

lyptic lore to light or helping to stave off cataclysms.

A remote mountain citadel serves as the organizations

worldwide headquarters. There, a group of  ve hooded

members known as the High Council provides guidance

on signi cant issues and settles matters of policy. Because

the  headquarters  is  so  remote,  however,  the  Watchers

handle mundane issues on a regional basis.

Activities: The Watchers for the Coming Sunset do

more  than  just  study  how  the  world  might  end;  they

actively try to prevent civilization-destroying events. A

decade  ago,  a  group  of  Watchers  destroyed  the  Key  of

Churik-Va, which could have unleashed a world-eating

plague of extradimensional insects. Currently, one group

of Watchers is studying ancient scrolls that speak of an

unquenchable black- ame wave, and another is hunt-

ing for the eleven vampiric unicorns destined to slay the

last living elf-child.

Recently, a secret splinter group has formed within the

Watchers. Its members believe that a coming apocalypse

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

will bring rebirth in the wake of ruin. Therefore, they

seek to hasten, rather than prevent, cataclysms. Success

with  such  an  effort  would  doubtless  cause  a  schism

within the remaining membership.

Distinctions:  The  motto  of  the  Watchers  for  the

Coming Sunset is It Shall Not Unravel. Watchers tend

to be secretive, so they use code phrases, sign language,

and secret handshakes to identify each other.

Admission:  Candidates  for  membership  must  pres-

ent  themselves  before  the  High  Council  at  the  moun-

tain  citadel  for  testing.  Finding  the  place  is  dif cult

enough,  but  getting  there  is  also  a  challenge  because

the surrounding wilderness is full of monsters and other

dangers. Those who attain the citadel must pass an oral

examination in arcana, history, the planes, or religion. A

successful Knowledge check (DC 20) in the appropriate

area earns admission.

Membership Bene  ts: All Watchers are expected to

take an active pan in defending their region and world

from coming apocalypses. This common cause creates an

unusual camaraderie among the collegians, so even the

newest member can expect assistance above and beyond

the call of duty from another Watcher.

Members also have access to the ultimate collection of

apocalyptic lore. Acquisition of new lore earns promotion

within the ranks as well as handsome remuneration.

Dues: Each Watcher pays dues of 1,000 gp per year.

Relations:  The  Watchers  for  the  Coming  Sunset

have cordial, if somewhat distant, relations with most

other  bardic  colleges.  They  can  call  on  a  number  of

powerful  clerics,  wizards,  and  political  leaders  if  the

situation  is  urgentand  given  their  line  of  work,  it

usually is.

Conservatory of the Ineffable Chord

Conservatory of the Ineffable Chord

Some bards are exceptional performers; others are great

composers. Members of this college are both. Students

of  music  everywhere  dream  of  studying  at  the  Con-

servatory  of  the  Ineffable  Chord,  for  it  is  said  that  its

teachers write songs too moving to sing and play notes

too sweet to hear.

Area of Study: Music composition and performance

are the twin passions of this colleges members, and its

ranks include masters of every conceivable instrument

and musical style. Recently, the college has also begun to

accept members who specialize in the recitation of epic

poems, although many of the musicians dont consider

such performers real members.

Organization:  The  Conservatory  of  the  Ineffable

Chord  awards   ve  ranks  of  expertise:  troubadour,

minstrel, muse, maestro, and virtuoso. New members

enter  at  the  troubadour  level.  They  quickly  discover,

however,  that  Conservatory  members  are  very  status-

conscious, and most consider troubadours little better

than street rabble.

Moving up to the next rank is as simple as passing an

audition before higher-ranking conservatory members.

A successful Perform check at the appropriate level (DC

30  for  minstrel,  35  for  muse,  40  for  maestro,  or  45  for

virtuoso) earns a promotion to that rank. Members may

not skip ranks, though there is no minimum amount of

time they must spend at any level before auditioning for

the next. Members of the college can audition once per

year  in  each  city  where  the  Conservatory  maintains  a

campus, so failure on any one of the above skill checks

usually means more practice and a long journey.

Conservatory  members  whove  retired  from  active

composition and performance serve as instructional staff

for the colleges campuses in return for sizable stipends.

Most of these teachers live on campus.

Activities: Every troubadour must study both compo-

sition and performance. A bard who is accomplished at

the lute but unable to pen his own songs is quickly shown

the door, as is a songwriting prodigy who cant sing like

an angel. Most members eventually discover that compo-

sition studies improve their playing and singing, and the

hours they spend practicing for performances sometimes

inspire new songs.

Distinctions: The Conservatorys motto is In harmony

with the primal rhythm. Members wear light blue robes

trimmed with a second color that re ects rank: white for

troubadours, gray for minstrels, dark blue for muses, silver

for maestros, and gold for virtuosos.

Admission: Anyone who pays the 100-gp testing fee

can audition for entrance. A successful Perform check

(DC 25) earns entrance to the Conservatory at trouba-

dour  level.  Those  who  fail  the  audition  can  try  again

after one year.

Membership  Bene  ts:  Members  can  lodge  free  of

charge  at  any  Conservatory  campus  for  as  long  as  they

wish. Most use this privilege to save the price of a room at

the inn while they study or collaborate with other musi-

cians. In addition, nearly every campus has a concert hall

that members can reserve for their own performances

again at no charge.

Maestros  and  virtuosos  have  access  to  the  conser-

vatorys collection of magic instruments, famous odes

and ballads, and bits of musical lore. Rumor has it that

they  also  have  access  to  eldritch  songscomposi-

tions of surpassing power and magic.

Dues: Each member who holds a concert within a city

that has a Conservatory campus must donate 10% of the

proceeds to the college.

Relations: The Conservatory of the Ineffable Chord

maintains good relations with all the other bardic colleg-

es. The public at large admires Conservatory members

because of their performance skills, though some travel-

ing bards regard them as unbelievably snooty.

League of Boot and Trail

League of Boot and Trail

Members  of  this  college  regard  every  road  as  a  class-

room and every inn as a laboratory. Devoted to travel

for  its  own  sake,  they  accumulate  little  lore  but  see

much of the worldand worlds beyond as well.

CHAPTER 4: ORGANIZATIONS FOR BARDS & ROGUES

Area of Study: Anything of interest to

travelers  is  of  interest  to  the  League.  The

college offers no formal, academic studies,

but its members are renowned guides and

scouts. They know, for example, the loca-

tions of toll booths, the best way to cross

the  Midnight  Desert,  and  which  church

now rules the province of Aramador.

Organization:  Because  its  members

are  rarely  in  the  same  place  for  long,  the

League of Boot and Trail has little formal

organization  and  no  central  leadership.

Nearly every city of any size has a League

station, where members can  le reports on

their  travels,  conduct  research  for  future

journeys,  and  share  drinks  and  tales  of

the  road.  A  senior  member  serves  as  sta-

tion head at each such location. If a crisis

affects  the  college  as  a  whole,  as  many

station heads as possible meet somewhere

and reach a solution by consensus.

Activities:  Each  League  member  must

help to run a League station for one month

out of every year. The most senior League

member of a given months working group

serves as station head.

Each  member  who  stops  at  a  League

station must  le a report describing his or

her travels since the last station stop. The

report  should  include  hazards,  weather

conditions, encounters, and any other in-

formation that might prove useful to other

travelers.

Occasionally, League

tattoo on each League members left forearm. Though

wearing actual red boots is not required, most members

do put red trim on their boots. In addition, every mem-

ber carves two small notches in each boot heel so as to

leave distinctive tracks.

Admission:  To  join  the  League  of  Boot  and  Trail,  a

prospective member must present three gifts, all originat-

ing from at least 300 miles away, to a station head. One of

these gifts must be a case of liquor worth at least 250 gp,

one must be an object of art worth at least 300 gp, and the

last must be a riding horse or warhorse. If the gifts meet

all  the  requirements,  the  candidate  is  tattooed  with  the

red boot and accepted as a member after a riotous party.

Membership Bene  ts: The most signi cant bene t

to membership in the League of Boot and Trail is access

to  the  reports  of  previous  travelers.  A  League  stations

information about travel hazards, monsters, and current

events isnt always up-to-date, of course, but when it is,

its highly reliable.

Any member can use the spartan accommodations at

a  League  station  free  of  charge.  Many  League  stations

operate  general  stores  that  sell  adventuring  gear  for

20% less than the going rate and horses for half price to

those bearing the red tattoo. In addition, merchants and

innkeepers along important trade routes often offer dis-

counts to travelers with red boot tattoos, hoping for good

reviews on the next set of League reports.

Dues: Dues are 500 gp per year, payable at the time of

the members one-month service at a station.

Relations: For the most part, the League of Boot and

Trail has few dealings with other bardic colleges. How-

ever, its members gladly swap stories with any members

of the Talespinners League they happen to encounter.

Those who make their livings catering to travelers

treat  League  members  well  in  the  hope  that

more  red-booted  business  will

come their way.

Explorers and The

League

The  League  of  Boot  and  Trail

counts  many  royal  explorers

among  its  members.  Some  of

the  worlds  most  legendary  ad-

venturers  recruit  for  their  expe-

ditions by posting offers of em-

ployment on the walls of League

station  common  rooms.  After

all, anyone heading beyond the

edge  of  the  world  should  have

some seasoned travelers along.

A  typical  League  station  might

have the following postings:

Travel  with  Karil  Minick  to

the  mirrored

Suskana.  Hiring  experienced

guards,  scouts,  healers,  and

Lidda

This chapter explores the roles of bards and rogues in

their  campaign  worlds  and  their  relationships  with

other characters. In addition, expanded discussions of

special combat options that these two classes favor are

presented.

THE ROGUE

Rogues tend to have a wider diversity of skills than any

other characters in a campaign. This gives them amaz-

ing   exibility  for  development  and  endless  ways  to

contribute to an adventuring partys success.

Role in the Campaign

Role in the Campaign

Some think of rogues as outcasts who live on the fringes

of society. Although some rogues may pretend this to

be  the  case,  nothing  could  be  farther  from  the  truth.

In fact, a few cultures (such as that of hal ings) openly

honor  the  mix  of  quickness,  cleverness,  and  luck  that

makes for a successful career as a rogue. Aside from that,

however, any adventurer soon learns to respect compa-

triots who are very, very good at what they doas most

rogues are.

In a world  lled with adventurers, a rogue need nev-

er lack for employment. Somebody always needs a trap

disarmed, a lock opened, or an item retrieved from an

inconvenient location. Some such activities may be il-

legal, but a rogue doesnt have to operate on the wrong

side  of  the  law  to  make  a  good  living.  For  example,

advising clients on how to burglarproof their homes

and goods can be quite lucrative. In fact, a surprising

number of rogues wind up as mayors, town elders, or

advisers  to  monarchs.  Such  careers  spring  from  the

rogues  characteristic  ability  to  analyze  a  situation

quickly and resolve it by the most ef cientthough

not necessarily most directmeans. Rogues also tend

to keep their eyes and ears open for opportunities

another good quality for a leader.

Many  of  the  rogues  class  skills  lend  themselves

especially well to statecraft. Rulers need Diplomacy to

say  the  right  thing  at  the  right  time,  Perform  to  give

stirring,  persuasive  speeches,  Bluff  and  Intimidate  to

cow the opposition, and Innuendo to convey more than

they actually say. Gather Information provides the kind

of ear-to-the-ground information that monarchs need to

maintain their power bases, and Sense Motive is invalu-

able for dealing with leaders of other power groupsbe

they  local  guildmasters  or  foreign  ambassadors.  Read

Lips, Decipher Script, and Use Magic Device can reveal

information that others think is secure, while Forgery,

used  sparingly,  can  provide  needed  authorizations  or

expose  the  false  credentials  of  others.  A  rogue  who

chooses  to  concentrate  on  such  interactive  skills  can

embark on the road to wealth and power without ever

stepping into a dungeon.

That said, however, its in dungeon situations that a

rogues talents really shine. Search and Disable Device

allow  her  to   nd  and  disarm  traps  before  her  party

blunders into them. Spot and Listen provide warning

when guards are nearby, and Move Silently and Hide

ensure that they dont notice her. Open Lock gets her

into places that others want secure, and Pick Pockets

lets  her  retrieve  items  from  those  who  might  other-

wise  object.  Balance,  Climb,  Swim,  Jump,  and  Use

Rope ensure that the rogue can get almost anywhere,

while  Escape  Artist  and  Tumble  help  her  get  out  of

sticky spots.

The fact that her partys survival may depend on her

talents places a heavy burden of responsibility on the

rogue.  She  must  be  self-reliant  when  scouting  ahead,

yet keep the groups interests in mind. She must keep

a  sharp  eye  out  during  combat  to  take  advantage  of

sneak  attack  opportunities.  Finally,  she  must  use  her

interpersonal skills when needed to persuade NPCs to

cooperate.

When  a  rogue  takes  these  responsibilities  seriously,

her companions learn to trust her completely. Sometimes

this trust bleeds over into other aspects of adventuring as

well,  and  she  ends  up  as  party  leadera  situation  that

happens more often than one might expect. A greedy or

self-serving rogue, on the other hand, is unlikely to be-

come a leader. If a rogue refuses to pull her own weight,

objects to scouting for the group, hangs back in combat,

or  gets  caught  pocketing  valuables  she  didnt  tell  her

comrades  about,  they  wont  trust  her  as  far  as  they  can

throw her. And should those pocketed valuables turn out

to be items pilfered from her party, she might  nd out

just how far that is.

To  sum  up,  any  adventurer  with  enough  brains  to

keep  his  or  her  ears  apart  knows  just  how  valuable  a

rogue can beespecially one who has earned her place

in the group. Or as Master Nuth, a rogue legendary for

his  daring  exploits,  put  it,  Fighters,  barbarians,  and

monks see combat as the obvious way to resolve situa-

tions because thats what they do best. Clerics, paladins,

and druids (and, to a lesser extent, rangers) are always

tempted to put the cause they serve ahead of the partys

interests. Wizards naturally resort to spellcasting when

in  doubt,  while  bards  and  sorcerers  sometimes  hesi-

tate  between  negotiation  and  spellcasting.  Your  role,

young rogue, is to see the picture as a whole, to plan for

77

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

contingencies, and to strike when the moment is right.

Thus may you prosper.

Role in the Game

Role in the Game

With her sneak attacks and light armor, a rogue deals

out  considerable  damage  in  the  right  situation  but

suffers  a  world  of  hurt  if  a  foe  catches  her  off-guard.

Unlike  combat-oriented  characters,  she  cannot  just

pound away at her foes, hoping she can barter her way

past their defenses before they penetrate her own. In-

stead, she must plan ahead to maximize her results. If a

 ghters tussle with a foe is like checkers, then a rogues

approach is more like chessmaneuvering rather than

direct attack brings success.

This  section  offers  some  pointers  on  strategy  and  a

few speci c tactics to help a rogue make the most of her

combat options. The eight axioms listed here are known

collectively as Nuths Laws.

Nuths Law #1: Develop a  ne sense of when to ex-

ercise caution and when to take a calculated riskand

try  to  make  all  your  risks  calculated  ones.  Planning

ahead  and  playing  the  odds  helps  you  avoid  many  a

nasty scrape.

Nuths  Law  #2:  Dont  be  the   rst  to  enter  a  melee

against  multiple  foesthe  last  thing  you  want  is  to  be

surrounded.  Though  you  may  often  have  the  chance  to

act before anyone else, resist the impulse to charge in. Let

the  ghters, barbarians, and monks pin down the enemy

in melee  rst, so you can see where the  anking positions

are. Then just tumble past and deliver your sneak attack.

If  that  doesnt  dispatch  the  foe,  tumble  away  if  neces-

saryyou certainly dont want to be  anked yourself. For

the rest of the battle, just keep moving into  anking posi-

tions and striking home with those sneak attacks. Holding

your action until your foe has used up his or her attack of

opportunity  against  a  better-armored  opponent  is  also  a

wise move.

Nuths Law #3: Beware of reach weaponsthe bane

of many an inexperienced rogue. Two good options exist

for dealing with a foe who has such a weapon. Remem-

ber  that  most  opponents  with  reach  weapons  are  like

knights in chessthey can attack only targets not adja-

cent to them. If you think you can tumble past the reach

of  your  foes  weapon  and  get  in  close,  go  for  it.  Better

still, stand back and pepper the fool with bolts from your

crossbow.With a ranged weapon, you can still get sneak

attack damage from up to 30 feet awaywell beyond the

range of any standard reach weapon.

Nuths Law #4: Try using a reach weapon yourself for

a  sneak  attack.  Whenever  you  threaten  a  foe  in  melee

and  have  an  ally  directly  opposite  you,  you  get  sneak

attack  and   anking  bonuses.  A  reach  weapon  lets  you

extend the range of that threat (see Flanking in Chapter

8  of  the  Players  Handbook),  and  most  foes  wont  realize

theyre  anked if theres no one standing right next to

them. A particularly nasty trick is for two rogues to attack

with reach weapons from opposite sides of an opponent

in  the  same  round.  In  this  situation,  both  rogues  gain

 anking and sneak attack bonuses, and neither is adja-

cent to the foe.

Nuths Law #5: Work with a partner whenever pos-

sible.  True,  you  get  to  keep  all  the  pro ts  from  your

exploits when you work alone, but theres no one to pull

you out of trouble.

If you team up with a combat specialist, your partner

can engage the foe while you circle around for a sneak

attack. A spellcasting partner can give you lots of use-

ful magical enhancements, such as invisibility, stoneskin,

endure elements, resist elements, spider climb,  y, and aid. A

ranger shares some of your stealth skills, but also offers

wilderness  savvy  to  complement  your  expertise  with

locks and traps. Perhaps the best option of all, though,

is teaming up with another rogue. Imagine your foes

surprise when, after he or she has maneuvered to make

sure  you  cant   ank,  your  partner  sneak  attacks!  The

thought  of  two  rogues  delivering  sneak  attacks  from

opposite directions should make anyone break out in

a  cold  sweat.  Be  wary,  thoughfoes  who  have  seen

this trick before may prepare for it by rushing  rst one

rogue and then the other.

Nuths Law #6: Tumble early and often. The more

attacks that miss you, the better off you are. If youre so

nimble that your foes give up in frustration and attack

other targets, all the better (for you, anyway).

Nuths Law #7: Maneuverability is key to being in the

right spot at the right time. Magic items exist that can

enhance your speed and maneuverability. Get them, by

fair means or foul, at the earliest opportunity.

Nuths Law #8: Dont be afraid to break off combat

and retreat. Those who run away can take on or track

down  the  same  foe  later,  when  the  odds  are  more  in

their  favor.  Those  who  stay  and  die  when  they  could

have  gotten  away  are  just  martyrs  to  stubbornness.

Should  you  ever   nd  yourself  trapped  with  nowhere

to  run  (what  were  you  thinking?),  dont  forget  that

surrender  may  be  an  optionremember  those  ranks

in  Escape  Artist  you  no  doubt  took?  Finally,  if  youre

trapped  by  an  implacable  foe  and  theres  no  way  out,

hurt himor her as badly as you can before you fall. Who

knows?  You  may  get  lucky,  and  at  least  that  foe  will

think twice about trying that again.

Motivation

Motivation

Its a dangerous job, scouting down dungeon corridors,

 nding and disabling traps, and tumbling into combat

wearing  only  light  armor  (if  any).  What  motivates

people to become roguesto bet their lives that their

skills, agility, and wits can overcome any obstacles or

foes in their way? As many answers exist as there are

rogues in the world, but one or more of the following

factors is part of almost any rogues motivation.

The Thrill of the Game: This rogue takes pride in

her  work  like  the  artist  she  is.  Its  the  challenge  that

draws  her  into  dungeon  after  dungeonthe  thrill  of

78

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

matching  her  skills  against  the  best  this  place  can

throw  against  her.  The  very  thought  of  encountering

a new kind of lock, a unique trap, or an unsolved mys-

tery is an irresistible lure. Some who do not share this

feeling liken it to an addiction for danger, but that snap

judgment misses the point. This rogue feels alive only

when  shes  using  all  her  skills  to  overcome  the  odds,

just as a master chess player lives to match wits against

the best. If that means placing her life in mortal danger

on a regular basis, so be it.

Moral Imperative: Adventuring is just a means to an

endthis rogue has a greater goal in mind. Perhaps she

intends to take back the ill-gotten goods of someone who

once wronged her familya pocketful at a time, if neces-

sary. Perhaps she sends all her loot to the poverty-stricken

village where she was born to pay for badly needed food

and supplies. Or perhaps shes a once-greedy thief who

had a change of heart and now seeks to make amends or

her previous crimes.

Some  rogues  have  gone  beyond  personal  motives

and adopted a philosophy called distributism. As  rst

formulated by a sage named Orlogue, its  rst and only

tenant  was,  Some  people  have  too  much  and  others

not  enough.  To  this,  the  rogue  Ashmore  Tuck  later

added a moral imperative, And Im going to do some-

thing about it! Adherents of this philosophy are called

Distributists.

through  grass-roots  movements.  A  rogue  who  hears

of the idea decides to put it into practice locally, then

another rogue whos just passing through learns of her

efforts and decides to duplicate them in his own home

region.  Since  distributism  spreads  so  randomly,  law

enforcement agencies  nd it very dif cult to snuff out.

(The hapless sage whose ideas gave rise to the philoso-

phy, however, was burned out of his tower by furious

notquite-  as-wealthy-as-they-had-been  victims  of  Dis-

tributists. But a rogue stole the deed to another tower

and presented it to him shortly thereafter.)

A Distributist rarely advertises her beliefs, since that

could  cause  wealthy  property  owners  to  put  a  hefty

price on her head. Instead, she singles out the ostenta-

tiously wealthy as targets and passes along the bulk of

her  booty  to  deserving  locals.  Unless  her  loot  comes

in the form of cash, she takes care to fence it  rst, lest

any  recognizable  items  get  the  recipients  in  trouble

with  the  law  later.  A  Distributist  usually  makes  her

donations anonymously, both out of innate caution (re-

cipients cant give her away to authorities if they dont

know who she is) and to avoid self-aggrandizement (its

not about building up a reputation, its about doing the

right  thing).  Naturally,  Distributists  are  very  popular

with  those  who  bene t  from  their  generosity  and

equally  unpopular  with  those  who  become  unwilling

donors to their causes.

Distributists  do  not  form  organizations  to  acquaint

others  with  their  beliefs;  instead,  their  ideas  spread

Greed:  Diametrically  opposed  to  a  Distributist  is

the rogue who is in it for the money. Born with a keen

79

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

appreciation of the  ner things in life, she  nds a rogues

abilities ideally suited to acquiring those things.

For  this  rogue,  theres  simply  no  such  thing  as  too

much  treasure,  and  she  begrudges  every  copper  piece

her  group  has  to  leave  behind.  She  routinely  pockets

valuable tri es she comes across while scouting ahead,

for in her mind, she simply called dibs on them  rst.

She may even lift particularly desirable items from her

adventuring  associates  if  she  can   nd  a  suitable  scape-

goat on whom to pin the blame.

Nevertheless, a greedy rogue can be an asset to a party

as long as her interests run parallel to those of her team-

mates she wants to reach that  nal treasure room so

badly that she gladly pulls her weight through all the en-

counters between here and there. Those who are aware

of her obsession can maintain a long-term, working rela-

tionship with her by holding out the endless lure of ever-

greater treasures that await in future adventures. Those

who fail to take her motivation into account inevitably

wake one day to  nd her gone, along with a few choice

items of party treasure.

Cultural Bias: Some rogues took up the profession

simply because they grew up listening to tales of Uncle

Odos exploits under Bone Hill, or Cousin Tanangers

exploration  of  Acereraks  tomb.  Hal ings  in  particu-

lar  embrace  thievery  as  an  honorable  and  rewarding

career  choice.  Of  course,  it  helps  that  hal ing  rogues

steal  primarily  from  other  races  and  only  rarely  from

their own.

Children of other races may also grow up with highly

positive attitudes toward rogues. The heads of some hu-

man families, for example, consider one or more of the

various rogue professions to be the family business and

expect succeeding generations to carry on the tradition.

Members of such families often try to make their marks

by pulling off notable capers, or challenge their offspring

to best their achievements.

The residents of some villages consider  nely trained

rogues  their  local  export.  Young  rogues  leave  to  seek

their  fortunes  when  they  come  of  age,  but  those  who

survive often return home to retire once their adventur-

ing careers are over. Their wealth enriches the town, and

their children begin the cycle again.

Conversely, a few cultures and religions disapprove

of  rogues  on  principle.  Of  course,  most  rogues  who

encounter  such  prejudice  go  out  of  their  way  to  use

their  skills  against  those  who  disapprove  of  them,

thereby perpetuating the cycle. Sometimes, however,

a  nonconformist  from  such  a  society  embraces  the

rogues  lifestyle  as  a  form  of  rebellion  against  her

upbringing.

Relations with Other Classes

Relations with Other Classes

Individuals differ, but some elements hold true for most,

if not all, members of a class. If youre playing a rogue, you

may  nd some good advice in the following paragraphs

about getting along with your fellow adventurers.

Barbarians: The barbarian tends to be impatient with

your  instinctive  caution.  It  isnt  that  hes  hostileits

just that the two of you sometimes rub each other the

wrong way. If youre an outdoors-oriented rogue (such

as a scout), you can get along with a barbarian better than

your dungeon-delving brethren can. Nevertheless, even

you prefer the rangers studied, stealthy approach over

the barbarians headlong charge into every melee. Stay

out of the way of the barbarians bull rush and use his

foolhardiness to distract opponents while you move in

for the kill.

Bards:  You  have  a  lot  in  common  with  the  groups

bard, so its easy to get along. Like you, he bene ts by en-

couraging opponents to underestimate him, and he can

be quite deadly when he uses his skills properly. The main

difference is that he likes the limelight more you do. Just

make sure the bard knows when to sing and when to be

silent and youll get along  ne.

Clerics: Every time a trap blows up in your face or a

sneak attack attempt goes horribly wrong, your groups

cleric becomes your best friend. Make sure youre on

good enough terms with him that hes willing to come

at a run when you need him. And if the dungeon turns

out  to  be  full  of  undead,  stick  to  the  cleric  like  glue.

Just dont let him get the idea that he has the right to

lecture you about morality. Insist that he respect your

skills as you do his.

Druids:  The  druids  abilities  are  nothing  at  all  like

yours, though both of you respect each others strengths.

Your  interests  rarely  coincide,  but  by  the  same  token,

they  rarely  cross.  This  tends  to  make  for  a  cordial,  but

distant, relationship. If your adventures take you into the

wilderness, though, partner up with a druid if you can

her plant lore and knowledge of wilderness hazards can

save your life. Likewise, if you run into animated plants

that  you  cant  sneak  attack,  let  the  druid  handle  them

while you watch her back.

Fighter: Whats not to love about a  ghter? He mans

the  front  line  so  you  can  sneak  around  and  deliver

your sneak attacks. He soaks up damage that otherwise

would come your way. He bashes down doors on those

rare occasions when you cant  nesse them open. And

he comes to the rescue when you run into more trouble

than  you  can  handle  while  scouting  ahead.  Your  life

would be a lot harder without your partys  ghter, and

an  occasional  pat  on  the  back  softens  up  the  big  lug

and shows him you appreciate it. Now if only he didnt

make so much noise!

Monk: By your standards, that monk is just downright

weird. Her abilities should mesh well with yours, but the

two of you are divided by a deep lack of understanding.

As  far  as  you  can  tell,  shes  not  in  it  for  either  the  loot

or the thrills. With her movement and melee skills, she

could be a great rogue, but she turns her attention inward

rather than toward all the neat items she could steal. A

monk can be handy to have around, but you just never

know where you stand with her.

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

Paladin:  Paladins  are  wonderful

they  really  are.  Theyre  powerhouses

in  combat,  free-handed  in  passing  out

the  healing,  and  uninterested  in

more  than  their  fair  share

of treasure. You can have a

great  working  relationship

with  your  partys  paladin  as

long as you set the ground rules

right away. Let her know

youre  a  free  agent  and

not  under  her  jurisdic-

tionunless

are, of course. In

that case,

you

you must be very careful anytime

you  need  to  do  something  your  paladin

friend wouldnt approve of.

Ranger: You probably have more in

common with your partys ranger than with any-

one else in the group. You both appreciate the need

for stealth, the value of scouting, and the necessity of

putting discretion ahead of glory at times. Perhaps all

that divides you is the fact that he never minds rough-

ing it, while you have a keen appreciation for the  ner

things in life. Nevertheless, you can trust the ranger to

get the job done, no matter what.

Sorcerer:  Sorcerers  are  fun  to  be  around  but

trickyyou never know when they have hidden agen-

das. Some are trustworthy and others arent, but theyre

all so slick that you never know until its too late. Make

sure any sorcerer in your group gets clear and frequent

demonstrations  of  why  hes  better  off  with  you  alive

than  not.  Enjoy  his  company,  let  your  group  bene t

from  his  powers,  but  dont  trust  him  any  more  than

you have to.

Wizards: In terms of adventuring style, the wizard

is your polar opposite. While youre out ahead, risking

your  life  to  scout  for  information,  shes  snug  in  the

safest spot in the marching order. Youre in the dun-

geon  to   nd  loot,  but  shes  there  to  feed  her  craving

for  more  magic.  Without  wizards  and  all  the  magic

traps they create, your job wouldnt be nearly as tough,

but there wouldnt be nearly as much interesting loot

available, either. The one thing you have in common

with  your  partys  wizard  is  a  keen  sense  of  strategy.

Both of you look for ways to maximize your contribu-

tions in a  ghtyou with a well-placed sneak attack,

and she with the right spell at the right time. The two

of you work very well together, and you can comple-

ment one anothers strengths.

THE BARD

That reminds me of a songit goes something like this. . . .

Devis

Role in the Campaign

Role in the Campaign

Everybodys friend, the bard is the most approachable

of all the arcane spellcastersless isolated than a wiz-

ard  and  less  threatening  than  a  sorcerer.  Though  he

shares many skills with rogues, he does not share their

criminal stigma. Most people either welcome him with

open arms as a talented entertainer or at the very least

tolerate him as reasonably harmless. The bard is one of

the few characters who can move freely through all lev-

els of society and among nearly all humanoids. His lute

and   amboyant  clothing  are  passports  to  any  place

where  the  people  enjoy  good  music,  from  an  elven

forest to a goblin warren.

This  wide  acceptance  makes  the  bard  an  excellent

messenger, for he can collect and distribute news wher-

ever his wanderings take him. Only a fool or a madman

would  kill  a  bard  without   rst   nding  out  what  he

knows.  Once  given  the  chance  to  talk,  of  course,  any

bard  worth  his  salt  can  not  only  convince  his  captors

to spare him, but get them to relate their life stories as

well! Naturally, a bard must be very careful not to abuse

this kind of trust. If bandits spare his life, he had best not

try to slit their throats by night or lead the local militia

to their lair. To do so would endanger all bards, for such

tales have a way of spreading.

For just this reason, bards take great pains to circulate

stories about the good fortune that comes to those who

treat bards well. Many a troll has heard the ballad about

one of his brethren who got a terrible stomachache and

81

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

died after eating a bard, just as most ogres know a tale

about a captive bard who was ransomed for a princely

sum. Some of the dimmer humanoids might fail to con-

nect the harp-holding man whose head theyre bashing

in with the bards mentioned in such stories, but ev-

ery little bit helps. Thus, bards everywhere continue to

make a concerted effort to keep alive the myth that bards

bring good luck.

In  most  campaigns,  the  bard  is  either  a  lighthearted

entertainer  or  a  trusted  go-between.  Its  not  unusual  to

 nd bards serving as nobles heralds or even ambassadors,

since they make such good spokesmen. Its rare, but not

unheard of, for a bard to wind up as the ruler of a city,

often simply because hes the best-known and best-liked

of its citizens. Bards generally prefer to avoid such ties, for

responsibilities restrict their wanderings and keep them

from meeting new people. And when it comes to visit-

ing new (often very out-of-the-way) places and meeting

different kinds of people, nothing beats adventuring.

Role in the Game

Role in the Game

By his very nature, the bard is a jack-of-all-trades. He tru-

ly shines in noncombat situations, but he can also acquit

himself well in a  ght, especially if he takes the Weapon

Finesse feat and concentrates on light, quick weapons.

If youre a bard, your best combat strategy is to keep

a  low  pro le  and  never  look  like  an  immediate  threat.

Intelligent foes usually target whoever they think poses

the  greatest  danger,  so  make  sure  they  pick  someone

elsethe wizard or sorcerer to shut down spellcasting,

the cleric to stop replenishment of hit points, the  ghter,

barbarian, paladin, or monk to reduce the damage dealt,

or even the rogue to prevent those nasty sneak attacks.

While  the  opponents  have  their  attention  focused  on

your  comrades,  youre  more  than  pulling  your  own

weight.  Your  bardic  music  boosts  your  teammates

morale,  wreaks  havoc  with  the  enemies  parry  coher-

ence, and prevents any sonic effects from harming your

friends. In addition, your counterspells could well save

your partys bacon. Should you need to join the  ght, of

course, you have quite respectable combat and spellcast-

ing abilities to contribute.

Make  no  mistake  about  ita  parry  is  always  better

off with a bard than without one. His bardic music im-

proves everyones talents by providing morale bonuses

in combat, competence bonuses for exploring, forewarn-

ings and clues from bardic knowledgethe list goes on

and on. In addition, the bard can serve as swingman in

the group. His arcane spells beef up the arsenals of the

wizard and sorcerer. His combat skills help during nasty

melees. His bardic knowledge and information-gather-

ing skills supplement clerical divinations. Though hes

not  skilled  with  locks  and  traps,  he  makes  a  credible

scout,  should  someone  need  to  sneak  up  and   nd  out

whats become of the rogue.

To  put  it  another  way,  conventional  wisdom  holds

that  a  standard  adventuring  party  should  consist  of  a

cleric,  a   ghter,  a  rogue,  and  a  wizard.  This  composi-

tion ensures the group access to healing, combat abil-

ity, scouting skills, and arcane artillery. Should such a

group wish to add a  fth member, a bard would be the

wisest choice. True, a barbarian or a monk would make

the party stronger, and a sorcerer would enhance the

groups arcane spellcasting ability. A paladin could join

the  ghter on the front line and provide some healing,

a ranger would add both combat ability and wilderness

skills,  and  a  druid  could  offer  wilderness  skills  and

healing.  Only  a  bard,  however,  shares  the  skills  of  all

four basic adventurer types (or the four basic monster

food groups, as bards sometimes put it). He has arcane

spells like a wizard, stealth skills like a rogue, combat

ability  like  a   ghter,  and  healing  skills  like  a  cleric.

Each of those characters is better than the bard in his

or her own  eld of expertise, but the bard can provide

backup for everyone. To be the second-best wizard, the

second-best scout, the second-best healer, and a reason-

able  ghter all at the same time is no mean featand

its one that no other class can match.

For  this  same  reason,  bards  also  excel  at  solo  adven-

tures. Each of the four basic characters specializes in one

area at the expense of the others, but the bard shares in all

their strengths. This is another reason he makes a good

messengera  bard  traveling  alone  has  a  much  better

chance of completing his mission than any other charac-

ter of the same level does.

On  top  of  his  bardic  music  and  his  wide  range  of

class  abilities,  the  bard  has  one  other  trick  all  his

own.  Bardic  knowledge  can  provide  key  information

for  solving  whatever  mystery  or  dilemma  the  group

faces.  Of  course,  the  characters  need  to  follow  up  on

information gained in this mannerthe DM cant be

expected to give away the whole plot of the adventure

in response to a couple of successful bardic knowledge

checks. Instead, the bard should become adept at pick-

ing up on clues, examining them from different angles,

and   guring  out  how  they   t  together  with  other

events in the game.

Bardic knowledge checks are also a convenient way for

the DM to toss out adventure hooks. However, the bard

himself can also spark new storylines by asking the right

kinds of questions. An observant DM can use such clues

to determine what kind of adventures the players would

most enjoy.

Motivation

Motivation

Adaptability  is  the  bards  greatest  strength.  He  is  wel-

come anywhere, from the poshest castle to the lowest

dive,  and  he   ts  right  in  wherever  he  happens  to  be.

Everywhere he goes, he listens to new songs, tries out

the local instruments, interviews those who witnessed

notable  events  (whether  last  week  or  two  generations

ago), and, in a word, mingles. Afterward, he folds all this

knowledge into his repertoire, which continues to grow

throughout  his  life.  Critics  might  dismiss  a  bard  as  a

82

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

mile wide and an inch deep, but that assessment misses

the pointhe genuinely likes people, and most people

like him right back.

Some  bards  view  themselves  as  heirs  of  a   ne  tradi-

tion. They seek to collect and preserve old songs, so that

the works of bygone ages may survive and  nd new au-

diences. Other bards are composers at heart, ever on the

lookout for new grist to grind in their creative mills. Still

others use their music primarily as a way to open doors

and meet new people with fascinating stories to tell. The

following paragraphs examine each of these motivations

in more detail.

Composer: For this bard, music is a form of expres-

sionan art that connects people of all backgrounds,

races,  and  cultures.  Through  the  universal  language

of music, he can show everyone in this deeply divided

world  just  how  much  they  all  share.  Most  nonbards

think  composers  are  self-centered,  interested  only  in

broadcasting  their  innermost  feelings  to  all  within

earshot.  Nothing  could  be  farther  from  the  truthif

a  composer  looks  inward,  its  only  to  seek  common

ground  with  others.  Hes  always  looking  for  ways  to

share the music that delights him.

A composer seeks to leave the world richer than he

found ita rare motivation indeed for an adventurer.

He adventures because it brings him into contact with

new people and exposes him to their music. It pains and

baf es him to  nd an unsympathetic audience, but he

never gives up looking for others who feel the way he

does about music.

Scholar:  A  seeker  and  collector  of  lost  music,  this

bard is always on the lookout for songs hes never heard

before. Upon visiting a new area, he immediately gets

the locals to sing him all the songs they know. Some-

times  he  can  piece  together  a  lost  ballad  from  several

partial versions remembered in different regions. His-

tory in the making is also of interest to the scholar, so he

frequently creates new songs to preserve the details of

recent events for posterity.

A sort of peripatetic sage who holds his library in his

head, the scholar is unmatched in his ability to retrieve

information.  His  bardic  knowledge  is  wide  and  deep,

covering  everything  from  the  events  that  inspired  a

recent lampoon about the Duke of Kroten to the  nal

words  of  the  last  Suel  empress  before  she  perished  in

the Rain of Colorless Fire. Theres no end to what he can

dredge up, and few lengths to which he would not go to

learn some new song or recover a lost epic.

Unlike a sage, however, a scholar bard does not hoard

knowledgerather, he seeks to share it with everyone

he meets. It is as though he is so full of songs that they

bubble over at the least provocation. In the words of one

poet describing such a bard, gladly would he learn and

gladly teach.

Performer:  Of  course,  some  bards  simply  glory  in

attention. They are stars, at least in their own eyes, and

theyre always on stage wherever they go.

A performer bard is, of course, monstrously conceited,

but  often  in  such  a  disarmingly  open  way  that  others

 nd  it  easy  to  forgive  his  excesses.  (The  fact  that  hes

remarkably charismatic often helps, of course.) His ev-

ery deed is calculated to gain him what he desires most:

more attention.

Many  such  bards  are  very  talented  indeed,  and  well

they know it. Some are happy in their megalomania and

 rmly convinced that theyre really the most important

people in the world. Others are insecure, temperamental,

and constantly in need of praise. The one true virtue that

they all share is absolute devotion to their talent. Perform-

ers can be a nightmare to adventure with, for they refuse

to do anything they consider beneath them, but theres

no denying their talent or commitment.

Gossip: Most adventuring bards fall into this category.

Gossip  may  not  be  a  term  they  would  apply  to  them-

selves, but its nevertheless an accurate description of

what they do.

A  gossip  makes  friends  quickly.  Within  a  day  of

arriving  in  a  new  town,  he  knows  more  about  whats

going on there than some of the lifelong residents do.

People  nd themselves con ding in him both because

he really wants to know what their lives are like and be-

cause  he  freely  volunteers  information  about  himself

as well. By matching their concerns with mood pieces

from his repertoire, the gossip lets his listeners know

that others have gone through the same troubles that

theyre  now  experiencing.  This  gives  them  a  sense  of

connection with those who have gone before and those

who will come after.

The  gossips  bardic  knowledge  tends  to  be  a  grab-

bagits very speci c when applied to areas hes passed

through but sporadic outside those regions. However, he

can usually draw parallels between the situation before

him and other similar cases, whether those were a month

or a thousand years before.

Sharing the con dence of so many people makes gos-

sips shrewd judges of character. They are also surpris-

ingly close-mouthed about matters theyve been asked

to keep secret, for the  ip side of inviting con dences

is respecting them. The wandering bardic lifestyle lets

gossips meet new people and run into old friends again

on a regular basis.

Relations with Other Classes

Relations with Other Classes

Individuals differ, but some elements hold true for most,

if not all, members of a class. If youre a bard, you may

 nd some good advice in the following paragraphs about

getting along with your fellow adventurers.

Barbarians:  The  barbarian  has  a  keen  appreciation

of  music,  especially  battle-chants,  long  laments,  and

epic tales about heroes of old. All this is good, but he

also tends to be impatient with people of other cultures.

This means he may rush to engage a group of strangers

before  you  even  have  a  chance  to  exchange  greetings

with them.

83

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

Clerics: Liturgical music and hymns are key parts of

nearly every clerics faith. Your cleric friend, however, of-

ten seems to think that this glorious music is somehow

a secondary or peripheral aspect of religionall right in

its place, but not essential. You strive to show by example

that this is not the case.

Druids: Nature is full of marvelous music, from bird-

song of every variety to sounds such as the rustle of leaves,

the howl of the wind, the rumble of distant thunder, and

the  pounding  of  the  waves  on  the  shore.  The  simpler

you  keep  your  music,  the  more  your  druid  friend

likes it. Although her view of the world fascinates you,

her path and yours have little in common.

Fighters:  Fighters  are  the  salt  of  the  earth.  Youd  be

dead  many  times  overand  your  precious  instrument

smashedif not for them. Fighters are simple souls who

face the same thankless tasks day after day, dungeon after

dungeon. To show your appreciation, you play their favor-

ite songs over and over.

Monks:  The  partys  monk  fascinates  you,  but  you

dont understand her at all. Its as though instead of mu-

sic in her head, she hears a silence that actually helps her

focus her inner spirit. Instead of turning to other people

for connections, she withdraws deeper into herself. Still,

you draw her out the best you can, for what songs you

could write if she would only tell you about her home-

land and relate the legends of her order!

Paladins: Dont paladins ever take a day off? Theyre

the  nicest,  friendliest,  prettiest,  and  all-around  most

impressive  people  youve  ever  metoutside  of  other

bards,  of  coursebut  they  have  no  sense  of  propor-

tion!  Eternal  vigilance  is  all  very  well,  but  even  a

paladin should get a weekend pass for a little rest and

recreation now and then. Until that happens, though,

its up to you to lighten your paladin friends load when

you can with one of those catchy, smite- em-all, march-

ing tunes.

Rangers: Woods are all very well in their place, but

youd go crazy if you had to spend your whole life there!

The druid at least has the excuse that she has to be near

her plant and animal charges, but the ranger just plain

likes living out in the weeds. Sure, you respect him

some of your best friends are rangersbut he must have

a screw loose somewhere, poor fellow.

Rogues:  Buddy!  If  youre  not  lucky  enough  to  be  a

bard, then the next best class to take up is rogue. You have

a lot in common with your rogue pal, such as a knack for

stealth and a keen appreciation of the fact that its better

to  avoid   ghting  when  you  can.  Granted,  youve  never

mastered that sneak-attack thing she does, but she doesnt

have your spells, music, or good looks. Clearly, the two of

you are a winning combination. Youre glad to adventure

with her, anytime, anyplaceshe can get you into more

interesting  situations  (and  trouble)  than  the  rest  of  the

party combined.

personality, though you prefer to think of it as charm. It

seems, though, that some sorcerers are just as happy to be

feared as liked, and that seems a pity. Still, you approve

of  sorcerersif  the  unthinkable  happened  and  you

couldnt be a bard anymore, sorcerer might be an attrac-

tive career choice.

Wizards: The wizard has the most wonderful pow-

ers,  but  she  pays  far  too  high  a  price  for  them.  All

that  planning,  all  that  study,  all  the  spontaneity  she

has to give upit would drive you crazy! You respect

her  expertiseshe  knows  more  spells  than  you  ever

willbut  pity  her  limitations.  Just  make  sure  you

never show it.

SPECIAL COMBAT

OPTIONS

This  section  explores  three  combat  options  used  fre-

quently  by  rogues  and  assassins:   anking,  garrote  at-

tacks,  and  sneak  attacks.  The  rules  for  garrote  attacks

are new; those for the other options are expansions of

the material in the Players Handbook.

Unusual Flanking Situations

Unusual Flanking Situations

Usually,  anking is simplejust get two characters on

opposite sides of an enemy. But what if the enemy oc-

cupies more than one square, or one attacker is using a

reach weapon? The following diagrams explain some of

the nuances of the  anking rule.

Characters  who  use  reach  weapons  make  the  situa-

tion  a  little  more  complicated.  First,  you  must   gure

out which square the attack is actually coming from

namely,  the  intervening  square  between  the  attacker

and  the  defender.  This  is  usually  obvious,  but  you  can

draw a straight line between the attackers centerpoint

and the defenders centerpoint if its unclear. Then de-

termine  anking as if the attacker were actually in that

intervening square.

Finding the Center Point

Finding the Center Point

If  youre  using  a  grid  for  combat,  the  easiest  way  to

 gure out whether two characters  ank an opponent is

to connect the centerpoint of your square with that of

your allys square. If that line passes through opposite

sides of the creature youre attacking, you  ank it. if the

line  emerges  from  two  adjacent  sides  of  the  enemy,

however, you dont. For example, the rogue in position

Rl on the map labeled Finding the Center Point  anks

the centaur if theres an ally in position A1 because the

line that connects those two positions passes through

both long sides of the centaurs token. But if the ally is

standing  in  position  B1,  no   anking  occurs.  The  line

that connects those two positions passes through one

long  side  and  an  adjacent  short  side  (the  rear)  of  the

centaurs token.

Sorcerers: In some ways, you and the party sorcerer

are  two  peas  in  the  proverbial  pod.  You  both  rely  on

Ordinarily,  if  you  want  to   ank  your  opponent,

theres only one place your ally can stand. If your foe

84

CHAPTER 5: YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU

ing lines pass through opposite sides of the enemy. For

the purposes of  anking, both squares are considered

directly opposite from the rogue.

Flanking Big Creatures

Flanking Big Creatures

Its much easier to  ank big creatures than little ones.

The rogue next to the bulette in position Rl on the map

labeled Flanking Big Creatures is  anking if she has an

ally in position Al, Bl, Cl, or Dl. Better still, allies in all

those spots get  anking bonuses from the rogue; thus,

one backstop character can give  anking bonuses to

multiple allies.

If you or your ally take up more than one square,

the  same  principle  appliessimply  draw  your  line

from the centerpoint of the whole character, not the

center of an individual square. The centaur rogue in

position R2 does not  ank the bulette with the cen-

taur in position A2, but he does with the centaurs in

positions  B2,  C2,  and  D2.  None  of  the  centaurs  are

tracing their lines from the centers of any squares

their  centerpoints  are  actually  on  grid  lines.  Thats

 ne.

Flanking with Reach Weapons

Flanking with Reach Weapons

On the map labeled Flanking with Reach Weapons, the

 ghter with a glaive in position A1 clearly provides a

 anking bonus for one of the three rogues in positions

R1. R2, and R3but which one? To  gure it out, draw

a line between the centerpoint of the  ghter at Al and

the centerpoint of the target. (You arent drawing lines

takes  up  more  than  one  square  on  the  grid,  however,

your ally has more options. The rogue in position R2

on the map is  anking the centaur whether an ally is

standing in position A2 or B2, because both connect-

conditions that would give you that extra damage.

Its a surprise round, and your foe either isnt acting this

round or hasnt acted yet.

Its  the   rst  round  of  combat,  and  your  foe  hasnt

acted yet.

Youre  anking your opponent.

Youre  invisible  and  your  foe  has  no  means  to  see

you.

Your foe is blind.

Your foe is grappled by someone other than you.

Your foe is climbing, walking a tightrope, or otherwise

off balance.

Your foe is running.

Your foe is stunned.

One of your foes ability scores has been reduced to 0.

(If its Constitution, of course, you can forget sneak

attacking; hes already dead.)

Your foe is cowering.

Your foe is paralyzed or held.

(cid:127)  Your foe is sleeping, bound, or unconscious.

Keep in mind that if your foe is immune to sneak attacks

by  virtue  of  creature  type  or  some  other  condition,  all

your  machinations  are  for  naught.  Even  if  one  of  the

above  conditions  applies,  you  still  dont  get  the  extra

sneak attack damage. Many of these conditions still grant

the attacker other bene ts, however.

Garrote Attacks

Garrote Attacks

A  garrote  is  more  dif cult  to  use  than  most  weapons

because the attack must be carefully set up to have a rea-

sonable chance of success. A garrote attack uses the grap-

pling  rules  from  Chapter  8  of  the  Players  Handbook,

with a few additions.

Attack  of  Opportunity:  You  provoke  an  attack  of

opportunity from the target you are trying to garrote. If

the attack of opportunity deals you damage, your garrote

attack fails.

Getting  the  Garrote  into  Place:  To  attack  with  a

garrote,  you   rst  need  to  loop  the  weapon  over  your

opponents head and work it into place around his or

her neck. To accomplish this, you must be able to reach

the targets head. This means you cannot garrote an op-

ponent two or more size categories larger than yourself

unless  that  opponent  is  sitting  or  lying  down,  or  you

are attacking from overhead.

If you can reach the targets head, you must make a

successful melee touch attack to grab him or her. Un-

like a normal  melee touch  attack, this does not allow

you to ignore all your opponents armor. If your foes

neck  is  protected,  you  might  not  be  able  to  place  the

garrote properly. To determine the opponents Armor

Class against a garrote attack, use his or her size modi-

 er (see Combat Statistics in Chapter 8 of the Players

Handbook),  plus  any  of  the  following  special  armor

modi ers that apply.

to your allies yet.) Then look at where the line enters

the enemys square. The square adjacent to that point

is where the  ghters attack is coming from. Now just

follow the usual rules for determining whos  anking

whom,  using  that  square  for  the   ghters  position.  In

this case, the rogue at R3 gets the  anking bonus, and

the other two dont.

Diagonal Corners and Flanking

Diagonal Corners and Flanking

If  the  line  between  two  allies  passes  through  opposite

corners of an enemys area, the allies  ank that creature.

For example, on the map labeled Diagonal Corners and

Flanking,  the  characters  at  Al  and  Bl   ank  the  drider

because the line that connects their centerpoints passes

through the left front and right rear corners of its area.

Heres  an  even  stranger  application  of  the  opposite

sides and corner rules. The ally standing at position A2

is giving  anking bonuses to the rogues at positions Rl,

R2, and R3. She helps the rogues at Rl and R3  ank be-

cause the line connecting her with each passes through

opposite sides of the enemys area. She helps rogue R2

 ank because the line between them connects opposite

corners of the enemys spaceactually the upper left

corner and lower right corner.

Sneak Attacks

Sneak Attacks

The  general  rule  for  the  sneak  attack  ability  states  that

a  rogue  gets  bonus  sneak  attack  damage  any  time  the

rogues  target  would  be  denied  his  Dexterity  bonus  to

AC (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or

when the rogue  anks the target. Below are some speci c

the bonus of the natural armor)

Provides a +4 armor bonus

Provides a +4 bonus

Provides a +10 bonus

If you fail to hit with your melee touch attack, your gar-

rote attack fails. If you are entitled to multiple attacks in

a round, you can attempt to place the garrote multiple

times at successively lower base attack bonuses.

Strangle:  Make  a  grapple  check  (see  Grapple  in

Chapter  8  of  the  Players  Handbook).  If  you  succeed,

you  have  started  to  strangle  your  opponent.  You  im-

mediately deal 1d6 or 1d8 points of damage, depending

on the type of garotte. Your Strength modi er applies

to this damage, and if that modi er is a bonus, you get

one and one-half times that bonus because youre using

both hands for the attack.

If you fail the grapple check, you dont start strangling

or deal damage. Your opponent slips free of the garrote

and is no longer considered grappled. You do not auto-

matically lose the grapple check if your opponent is two

or more size categories larger than you are, as you would

with a normal grapple check. Your opponent is consid-

ered grappled if you succeed.

Move In: Unless you used a locking garotte to make

your  attack,  you  must  move  into  the  targets  space  in

order  to  maintain  the  strangle.  Moving,  as  normal,

provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening en-

emies, but not from your target.

Maintaining  a  Garrote  Attack:  Once  you  have  a

cord  garotte  or  a  wire  garotte  in  place,  have  won  the

grapple  check,  and  have  moved  into  your  opponents

space,  you  can  continue  to  deal  garrote  damage  with

successful  grapple  checks  as  often  as  you  are  entitled

to attempt them. If you have multiple attacks, you can

attempt  multiple  grapple  checks  each  round  to  deal

damage. Each time you succeed with a grapple check,

you  deal  garrote  damage,  modi ed  as  above  by  your

Strength modi er. The garrote remains in place until

you  release  your  opponent  or  until  he  or  she  escapes

by breaking your hold (see Grapple in Chapter 8 of the

Players Handbook).

Unless you used a locking garotte to make your attack,

you and your opponent are considered grappled while

you maintain a garrote attack. You cannot attempt to pin

your opponent during your garrote attack, nor can you

attack with another weapon.

While  Youre  Being  Garroted:  Being  garroted  is

just  like  being  grappled,  except  that  you  suffer  normal

damage. You can attempt to escape the garrote by mak-

ing  a  successful  grapple  check  on  your  turn.  If  youre

allowed  multiple  attacks,  you  can  attempt  to  escape

multiple times. You can also attack with a light weapon.

Spellcasting is dif cult, since no verbal (V) or somatic (S)

component is possible. You may cast spells requiring only

material components or focuses only if you have them in

hand. If the spell is one you can cast while being stran-

gled, you must still make a Concentration check (DC 20 +

spell level) to avoid losing it.

Cutting a garrote from your own throat is possible us-

ing the Attack an Object action, but its dif cult. Since

a  garrote  is  a  Small  weapon,  it  has  an  Armor  Class  of

11; however, since its buried in your neck, it gets a +10

cover bonus to Armor Class, for a total Armor Class of 21.

In addition, you incur a -4 circumstance penalty on your

attack  because  you  have  to  avoid  damaging  your  own

neck in the process. You cannot use the disarm action

against  an  attacker  who  has  a  garrote  wrapped  around

your neck.

Strategy: The garrote is a good weapon for one-on-one

surprise attacks, when theres a good chance of taking the

target unaware. Hence, this weapon is a favorite among

assassins, spies, and sneak thieves. It makes a poor melee

weapon against multiple opponents, since its wielder is

vulnerable to attacks from the targets friends while hold-

ing the garrote in position and waiting for the victim to

die.  Locking  garrotes.  while  rare,  are  good  for  causing

major distractions, since friends of the victim typically

break off pursuit of the attacker to save their companion

from the garrote.

CHAPTER 6 :

SPELLS

Music is so much a part of a bards life that he weaves it

through everything he does. Thus, it should come as no

surprise that many of the new bard spells presented in

this chapter are musical in both name and nature.

Members  of  the  assassin  prestige  class,  on  the  other

hand, tend to see spellcasting in a more utilitarian way.

Their spells are tools, just like their garrotes, poisons, and

blowguns. The new assassin spells in this chapter make

excellent additions to the assassins toolkit.

order.

Absorb Weapon

Absorb Weapon

Transmutation

Level: Asn 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Effect: One touched weapon not in another creatures

possession

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

You can harmlessly absorb any light weapon you touch

(even a poisoned one) into your arm, as long as it is not in

another creatures possession. The absorbed weapon can-

not be felt under the skin and doesnt restrict yourrange

of motion in any way. An absorbed weapon cannot be

detected  with  even  a  careful  search,  although  a  detect

magic spell reveals the presence of a magical aura. The

only evidence of the weapon is a faint blotch on the skin

thats shaped vaguely like the weapon. When you touch

the spot (an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), or

when  the  spell  duration  expires,  the  weapon  appears

in  your  hand  and  the  spell  ends.  An  intelligent  magic

weapon gets a saving throw against this spell, but other

weapons do not.

Allegro

Level: Brd 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 10 ft.

Area:  Creatures  within  a  10-ft.-radius  burst,  centered

on you

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell makes you and your companions extraordi-

narily  eet of foot by doubling each subjects speed and

maximum  jumping  distance  (treated  as  an  enhance-

ment  bonus  to  both).  Affected  creatures  retain  these

effects for the duration of the spell, even if they leave

the original area.

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal (see text)

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will disbelief

Spell Resistance: No

Ambient song transforms the sounds needed to produce

any bardic music effect into background noise. Those

who hear bardic music masked in this way remain un-

aware of its true nature, though it still has its normal

effects. For example, you could use this spell to make

a song intended to inspire competence sound like the

chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves, or the crack-

ling of the camp re.

You choose what your ambient song sounds like, but it

should be a noise thats in harmony with the immediate

environment.  A  subject  who  makes  a  successful  Will

save realizes that the sound has been altered and can hear

its true nature.

Material Component: A small bit of whatever naturally

makes the sound youre trying to mimic. For example,

a crickets leg, a dried leaf, or a charred twig would pro-

duce the ambient song effects mentioned above.

Blunt Weapon

Blunt Weapon

Transmutation

Level: Brd 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: All piercing and slashing weapons within a 20-ft

radius burst

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Blunt  weapon  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  certain  weap-

ons  by  rendering  them  semisubstantial.  Affected  weap-

ons appear shimmery or shadowy when examined closely,

but the wielder must speci cally examine the weapon (a

move-equivalent action) to notice the effect. An affected

weapon retains its full enhancement bonus and magical

abilities  (if  any),  but  its  base  damage  is  reduced  by  half.

The strength bonus of the wielder still applies normally

to attacks and damage.

A  weapon  carried  by  a  creature  uses  that  creatures

Fortitude saving throw. A magic weapon gets a bonus

equal to its enhancement bonus on this save.

Only  manufactured  piercing  and  slashing  weapons

are  affected  by  blunt  weapon.  It  has  no  effect  on  natu-

ral  weapons.  Arrows  and  other  projectile  weapons

affected  by  the  spell  remain  blunted  even  after  they

leave the spells area.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Three illusory performers

Duration: Concentration + 4 rounds

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (see below)

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  creates  spectral  accompanists.  They  appear

to be normal performers of any humanoid race (casters

choice)  who  back  up  the  bards  performance  by  play-

ing,  dancing,  singing,  or  any  other  means  the  caster

desires. They can also interact with others on a limited

basissmiling,  nodding,  responding  to  questions

with  a  few  stock  phrases,  serving  as  dance  partners,

and the like. These illusory performers grant the caster

a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on  Perform  checks  for  the

spells duration.

Choir  is  a  Pattern,  not  a  Figmentcreatures  that  be-

come  aware  of  the  accompanists  spectral  nature  can

still see them. However, not only does a successful Will

save negate the bards bonus on Perform checks with

respect  to  that  creature,  it  also  imposes  a  -2  circum-

stance penalty on those checks for the remainder of the

spells duration.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Crescendo

Crescendo

Evocation

Level: Brd 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Targets: The caster and all allies within a 30-ft. sphere

Duration: 4 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell creates a martial fanfare that slowly builds in

volume, inspiring you and your comrades to ever-greater

combat prowess. During the  rst round of the spell, the

horns and drums can be heard faintly, but no other ef-

fect occurs. On the second round, as the music becomes

louder and more inspiring, each affected creature gains a

+1 morale bonus on attack rolls. This bonus increases to

+2 in the third round, then to +3 in the fourth round as

the music gets louder and louder.

Allies who move more than 30 feet away from you lose

the bonus, but they regain it at its then-current level if

they later step back within range.

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: No (see below)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  minor  magical  effect  makes  counting  and  calcu-

lating a breeze. You can estimate the number of gold

pieces in a pile, the distance of a gap you might have

to leap, the number of foes rushing toward you, or the

likeall in a  ash. To make such an estimate, make a

Perform  check  (DC  15).  Success  means  your  guess  is

within 10% of the true  gure; failure means it is off by

20/6 or more. The exact extent of such a miscalculation

is up to the DM.

Fanfare

Fanfare

Evocation

Level: Brd 6

Components: V S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 100 ft.

Area: Cone

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Fanfare creates a trumpet blast so loud that it can shake

the foundations of buildings or stop an army in its tracks.

Every  creature  within  the  area  must  make  a  Fortitude

save.  Success  means  the  creature  is  stunned  for  1d4

rounds and deafened for twice as many rounds; failure

means the creature takes 4d6 points of damage in addi-

tion to suffering those effects. Any object made of glass,

wood, stone, or metal within the cone takes 2d6 points of

damage, ignoring hardness.

Material Component: A small, tin horn.

Level: Brd 0

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Touch

Target: One instrument

Duration: 1 minute per level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell enables the caster to make an ordinary instru-

ment perform as if it were of masterwork quality. For the

duration of the spell, the instrument grants the user a +2

circumstance bonus on Perform checks, or an alternate

effect as described in Chapter 3 for that instrument type,

if desired. Fine-tuning has no effect if cast upon an instru-

ment already of masterwork quality.

Focus: The target of the spell.

For  example,  you  could  use  focusing  chant  to  gain  a

you  start  climbing  a  tall  cliff,  or  on  Decipher  Script

just  before  you  begin  deciphering  ancient  runes.  In

combat,  you  can  gain  the  bonus  on  your  attack  rolls

as  long  as  you  continue  to  attack  the  same  opponent

with the same weapon every round. You can still move

freely  and  change  tacticsfor  example,  you  could

charge a monster one round, attempt to disarm it with

your rapier the second round, and simply attack it on

the third round. But if you attack a different monster,

switch  weapons,  or  spend  a  round  doing  something

other than attacking, the bene t is lost.

Fortissimo

Fortissimo

Evocation

Level: Brd 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature or item

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Fortissimo  doubles  the  volume  of  one  source  of  sound

speci ed by the caster. Bards often use this spell to help

their music carry to larger audiencesor just be heard

over the din of a noisy tavern.

When  casting  fortissimo  on  a  creature,  the  caster  may

specify items that the creature is wearing or carrying

for  inclusion  in  the  effect.  For  example,  casting  fortis-

simo  on  a  singer  and  including  her  lute  would  make

both her song and her accompaniment twice as loud.

If the affected creature or item can generate a sonic or

language-based attack, such as a command spell, a harpys

song, the fascinate effect of bardic music, or a horn of blast-

ing, the saving throw DC against that attack increases by

+2. If a sonic attack deals damage (like a shout), the spell

increases that damage by +1d6 points.

Fortissimo counters and dispels silence and is countered

and dispelled by it. If cast at a target affected by silence, it

negates the effect for that creature or item only.

Enchantment (Mind-Affecting)

Level: Asn 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Area: Up to 1 city block/level

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell helps you elude pursuers by causing them to

run  down  blind  alleys,  make  wrong  turns  at  intersec-

tions, and bypass obvious directional indicators during

a chase. Any pursuer who loses sight of you and fails

a Will save has a 50% chance of making a wrong turn

or heading in the wrong direction, even in the face of

physical evidence (such as a dangling rope or an open

door) as to your true path.

Material Component: A foxs tail.

Harmonic Chorus

Harmonic Chorus

Transmutation

Level: Brd 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Harmonic chorus lets you improve the spellcasting ability

of another spellcaster. For the duration of the spell, the

save DCs for all spells that the subject casts increase by

1d4+1. If such a spell deals damage, that damage increas-

es by +1 point per die. For example, if you cast harmonic

chorus on a 9th-level wizard who in turn casts  reball, the

DC of the  reballs Re ex save would increase by 1d4+1,

and  the  spell  would  deal  9d6+9  points  of   re  damage.

Other variable aspects of the spell (range, duration, and

so forth) remain unchanged.

The bene ts of multiple harmonic chorus spells stack

only when they are cast by different casters.

Material Component: A tuning fork.

Harmonize

Harmonize

Evocation

Level: Brd 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Range: Touch

Targets: Up to 4 bards (including the caster), none of whom

can be more than 10 feet from the nearest other target

92

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  enables  two  to  four  bards  to  pool  their  tal-

ents  by  performing  in  a  group.  The  caster  designates

one bard to be the lead performer, and the rest provide

backup. Harmonize grants the lead performer a circum-

stance bonus on Perform checks equal to +1 per three

bard levels of the backup performers for the duration of

the spell.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Healthful Slumber

Healthful Slumber

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Brd 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: Living creatures within range

Duration: 1 day

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Healthful slumber doubles the subjects natural healing

rate. Each affected creature regains twice the hit points

it otherwise would have during that day, depending on

activity level.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Hymn of Praise

Hymn of Praise

Evocation [Good, Sonic]

Level: Brd 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft/level)

Area: A sphere with a radius equal to the range, centered

on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You can strike up a rousing, inspirational spiritual that

temporarily  boosts  the  effective  caster  level  of  each

good-aligned  divine  spellcaster  within  range  by  +1.

This increase does not grant access to additional spells,

but it does improve all spell effects that are dependent

on caster level. In addition, hymn of praise mimics the

effect of a hallow spell with respect to turning or rebuk-

ing undead. Within the spells area, each good-aligned

divine spellcaster gains a +4 sacred bonus on Charisma

checks  to  turn  undead,  and  each  evil-aligned  divine

spellcaster  incurs  a  -4  sacred  penalty  on  Charisma

checks to rebuke undead.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Improvisation

Improvisation

Transformation

Level: Brd 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Improvisation makes available a  oating pool of bonus

points that the caster can use as desired to improve his

or her odds of success at various tasks. This bonus pool

consists of 2 points per level, which the caster can divide

as desired among attack rolls and skill or ability checks.

The  caster  must  declare  any  bonus-point  usage  before

the  appropriate  rolls  are  made.  Used  points  disappear

from the pool, and any points remaining when the spell

ends are wasted. These points count as luck bonuses for

purposes of stacking.

For example, a 14th-level bard pauses from chasing a

pickpocket to cast improvisation. Over the next 14 rounds,

he could add +8 to a Spot check, +6 to a Climb check, and

+7 to two of his attack rolls.

Material Component: A pair of dice.

Infernal Threnody

Infernal Threnody

Evocation [Evil, Sonic]

Level: Brd 3

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: A sphere with a radius equal to the range, centered

on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  can  strike  up  a  pulsing,  powerful  rhythm  that

temporarily  boosts  the  effective  caster  level  of  each

evil-aligned divine spellcaster within range by +1. This

increase does not grant access to more spells, but it does

improve  all  spell  effects  that  are  dependent  on  caster

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

level. In addition, infernal threnody mimics the effect of

an unhallow spell with respect to turning or rebuking

undead.  Within  the  spells  area,  each  evil-aligned  di-

vine spellcaster gains a +4 profane bonus on Charisma

checks to rebuke undead, and each good-aligned divine

spellcaster  incurs  a  -4  profane  penalty  on  Charisma

checks to turn undead.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Insidious Rhythm

Insidious Rhythm

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Brd 6

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 3 rounds

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 hour per level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster plays a catchy, silly, little tune that sticks in the

mind of any subject who fails a Will save. The endlessly

recycling  melody  makes  it  very  dif cult  for  the  subject

to cast spells, disarm traps, or perform any other action

that requires mental focus. Thus, the subject incurs a -4

circumstance penalty on all skill checks based on Intelli-

gence and must make a Concentration check (DC = insidi-

ous rhythms save DC + level of the spell being attempted)

for each spellcasting attempt.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Joyful Noise

Joyful Noise

Abjuration

Level: Brd 1

Components: S, F

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: 10 ft.

Area: 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

Duration: Concentration (see text)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

By  making  a  strumming,  drumming,  or  whistling

gesture, you negate any magical silence in the area. This

zone of negation moves with you and lasts as long as you

continue the performance.

The silence is not dispelled but simply held in abeyance;

it  remains  in  effect  outside  the  area  of  the  joyful  noise.

Thus,  this  spell  is  usually  used  to  move  a  group  out  of

range of a silence effect.

CHAPTER 6: SPELLS

Range: See text

Effect: Magical sensor

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You can turn two ordinary coins into magic listening

devicesone a sensor and the other a receiver. After

casting the spell, you simply give the sensor coin away,

either surreptitiously or overtly. By holding the receiv-

er coin up to your ear and making a successful Listen

check,  you  can  hear  whatever  is  transpiring  near  the

sensor. If the sensor coin is in a pocket, pouch, or sack,

the DC for the Listen check increases by +5 for all but

the most obvious sounds.

The  coins  continue  to  function  no  matter  how  far

apart  they  are,  although  they  fall  silent  if  theyre  on

different  planes.  Lead  sheeting  or  magical  protection

(such  as  antimagic   eld,  mind  blank,  or  nondetection)

blocks the transfer of sound.

Any creature with an Intelligence score of 12 or high-

er can notice that a coin has a magical sensor by making

a successful Scry (or Intelligence) check (DC 20). The

sensor can be dispelled.

Lullaby

Lullaby

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Brd 1

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: Living creatures within a 15-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Concentration (see text) plus 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You can play a tune so foot-tappingly appealing that ev-

eryone who hears it wants to jump up and dance. In fact,

unless your target makes a successful Will save to resist,

thats exactly what happens. A dancing creature suffers

a -2 circumstance penalty to its Armor Class, Will saves,

Concentration  checks,  and  Spellcraft  checks  for  as

long as you keep playing.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Percussion

Percussion

Illusion (Figment)

Level: Brd 0

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25ft. + 5 ft/2 levels)

Effect: Illusory sounds

Duration: 5 minutes/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with)

Spell Resistance: No

Percussion  lls the immediate area with the sounds of

drums, chimes, and other percussive instruments. The

music  can  range  from  the  gentle  tapping  of  a  single

tom-tom to the thunder of a squad of drummers. Upon

casting the spell, you set the tempo of the drums and

the rhythm they repeat. Thereafter, you can change the

tempo, rhythm, or volume simply by concentrating for

1 round.

Bards  often  use  this  spell  to  provide  background

accompaniment  for  their  own  music  and  songs.  The

sounds produced are no louder than real drums would be,

but the effect is realistic enough to fool anyone who cant

see that no drummers are present.

Material Component: Two smooth wooden sticks, which

you must touch together to cast the spell.

The caster play a gentle melody that lulls the senses of

those  who  hear  it.  Any  creature  within  the  area  that

fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, suffer-

ing a -2 circumstance penalty on Spot and Listen checks

and a -2 circumstance penalty on Will saves against sleep

while the lullaby is in effect.

Many bards use this spell in conjunction with either

ambient song or a silent or disguised spell to improve the

odds against anyone noticing such a ruse.

Focus: The casters instrument.

You  can  brie y  grant  bardic  abilities  to  a  creature  of

your choice. The subject of the spell can then function

as a bard of half your current bard level with respect to

bardic music and bardic knowledge. However, protg

imparts  no  spellcasting  ability  and  does  not  grant  ac-

cess to spells not normally available to the subject. For

Perform  checks  and  bardic  music  prerequisites,  the

creature uses its own ranks in Perform or half of yours,

whichever is better.

Transmutation

Level: Asn 4

Components: V S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Effect: Personal

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  magically  enhances  your  senses,

making  you  deadly  with  ranged  weapons.

When  you  cast  snipers  eye,  you  gain  the  follow-

ing bene ts:

Darkvision  as  a  spell-like  ability,  lasting  for  the  dura-

tion of snipers eye.

(cid:127) The ability to make a ranged sneak attack against any-

one within 60 feet, rather than the usual 30 feet.

The  ability  to  make  a  death  attack  with  a  ranged

weapon within 30 feet.

A +15 competence bonus on Spot checks.

Snipers  eye  attunes  you  completely  to  the  vantage

point  you  have  when  you  cast  the  spell.  You  under-

stand  the  nuances  of  the  breeze  and  every  angle  and

shadowfrom that spot. If you move more than 5 feet

from there, you lose the bene ts of snipers eye until you

return within the spells duration.

Material Component: A magnifying glass lens.

Song of Discord

Song of Discord

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Brd 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: Creatures within a 15-ft.-radius sphere

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each

other rather than attack their foes. Each affected crea-

ture has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each

round.  (Roll  to  determine  each  creatures  behavior

every  round  at  the  beginning  of  its  turn.)  A  creature

that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act

normally for that round.

Creatures forced by a song of discord to attack their

fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing

their  deadliest  spells  and  most  advantageous  combat

tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have

fallen unconscious.

Spectral Weapon

Spectral Weapon

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Brd 4

Components: V S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Effect: One weapon

Duration: Up to 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Using  material  from  the  Plane  of  Shadow,  you  can

fashion  a  quasi-real  weapon  of  any  type  you  are

pro cient  with.  This  spectral  weapon  appears  in

your hand and behaves as a normal weapon of

its type, with one exception: Any foe who

makes a successful Will save recognizes

its  shadowy  nature  and  thereafter

takes  only  one- fth  normal

damage

it.  The

from

weapon  has  the  ghost

touch  ability  and  is  +1  for

every  5  levels  of  the  bard

casting  the  spell.  You  can  maintain  only  one  spectral

weapon at a time, and only you can wield it. The weapon

dissipates when you let go of it or when the spells dura-

tion expires, whichever comes  rst.

Focus: The casters instrument.

Spring Sheath

Spring Sheath

Transmutation

Level: Asn 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Effect: One sheath, buckle, or strap

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

You can use this spell to turn an ordinary weapon sheath

into a helpful magic device. Any quick hand motion in

front  of  the  affected  weapon-holding  device  (a  free  ac-

tion) causes the weapon inside to shoot forth of its own

volition and settle into your hand. The overall effect is the

same as that of the Quick Draw feat.

Although this spell is usually cast on a sword sheath, it

also works on the straps, buckles, and pockets that hold

other weapons. You could, for example, cast spring sheath

on the strap of the backpack that usually holds your long-

bow to make that weapon  y into your hand.

Spell Resistance: No

hillside, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and

no damage occurs.

Sympathetic  vibration  cannot  affect  living  creatures.  A

structure gets no saving throw, but a construct gets a Will

save to resist the effects.

Material Component: A tuning fork.

This  spell  conjures  one  instrument  of  the  type  the

caster  typically  favors.  The  quality  of  this  summoned

instrument can vary widely (roll 1d6): poor (1), average

(2-5), or masterwork (6). Only one instrument appears

per  casting,  and  it  cannot  be  exchanged  for  another.

The caster can, however, reject the instrument simply

by dismissing the spell.

This is a real instrument temporarily borrowed from

elsewhere, not a  gment or creation. For that reason, it

is considered good form to deposit a small fee inside the

instrument before it returns whence it came.

Duration: Up to 1 round per level

Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure such as

a building, bridge, or dam, you can create a damaging

vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals

2d10  points  of  damage  per  round  to  the  target  struc-

ture. You can choose at the time of casting to limit the

duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round/level,

if cast upon a target that is not freestanding, such as a

Anyone  caught  in  the  cone  of  this  spell  suffers  ex-

cruciating  pain  and  is  disheartened  and  demoralized

besides. Each creature that fails its Will save takes 1d4

points of damage per caster level, suffers a - 2 morale

penalty on saving throws for 1 round per caster level,

well. If cornered, the affected creature cowers instead

of  eeing (see Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the

By  casting  zone  of  silence,  you  can  manipulate

sound waves in your immediate vicinity so that

you and those within the spells area can converse

normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices

or any other noises from within. This effect is cen-

The Hand of the

Highwayman

A Web Enhancement for Song and Silence

The judicious use of bardic abilities can help an adven-

turing group in a variety of ways. Bardic knowledge can

provide background information for an area or a situa-

tion, offer clues to a mystery, serve as a vehicle for the

Dungeon Master (DM) to introduce new concepts, and

even help the canny DM determine what areas of the

campaign world interest players most.

Bardic music can bolster an adventuring partys

combat capabilities, counter spells, and pave the way

for gathering information, conducting investigations,

and a host of other noncombat situations. In addition,

the bards normally high Charisma helps him make

friends and gain new allies almost everywhere he

goes.

If your players arent accustomed to using bardic abili-

ties to their fullest, it may help to send the characters

on an adventure that offers several opportunities for

using these talents. Heres a short scenario that demon-

strates how bardic abilities can enhance a groups suc-

cess.

This  DUNGEONS &  DRAGONS  web  enhancement

showcases bardic abilities (particularly bardic knowl-

edge) and features a spymaster NPC, as well as several

of the sample traps listed in Song and Silence: A Guide-

book to Bards and Rogues. It is designed for four charac-

ters of 6th to 7th level. The party should include at least

one bard.

PREPARATION

You need the Players Handbook, the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide, the MONSTER MANUAL, and Song and Silence to

run this mini-adventure.

Text in shaded boxes is player information. Monster

statistics noted in each encounter are radically abbrevi-

ated, but provide the MONSTER MANUAL page number.

ADVENTURE

BACKGROUND

The elven overlords of the Lendore Isles want control

of the few remaining human-ruled coastal towns of this

continent. Their efforts to gain that influence through

alliances have thus far been rebuffed. Therefore, they

have decided to use more circuitous means to reach

their goal.

They have sent two agents, a necromancer and a spy-

master, to the coastal city of Restenford to start a myste-

rious crime wave. Their hope is that this will panic the

citizenry and force Baroness Andrella to waive the

towns autonomy and call on the elves for help.

After assessing the situation, the two decided to create

a little-known necromantic item called the glorious

1

hand to  use  in  their  crime  wave. The  spymaster

obtained the necessary raw materials (including the left

hand of a recently hanged murderer) and slew the local

lighthouse keeper. The two then moved into the light-

house and set to work.

Once they had completed the glorious hand, the spy-

master began a series of nightly robberies, some cou-

pled with murder. They stashed the loot in an aban-

doned thieves hideout in the citys sewers so that no

one would find it. However, the necromancer grew

greedy and began taking items from the stash. When

the spymaster discovered this, he slew his partner

and left him for the dire rats in the sewer hideout to

devour.

Since then, the spymaster, Sirius, has been continuing

the mission alone. The scenario opens with the crime

wave in full swing.

ADVENTURE SUMMARY

This adventure begins with a bandit ambush, which

should clue the player characters (PCs) in to the local

problems. If the PCs choose to investigate, they can

visit Restenford and see the local wizard, the church,

the thieves guild, and the city guard. They might also

have a chance to interact with the Baroness via the

bards performance. If they go about it correctly, they

can find clues with the guards and the sewers that lead

to the spymaster, who has taken on the role of the local

lighthouse  keeper.  (He  killed  the  real  lighthouse

keeper.) Should the PCs discover all of this, they can

end the crime wave and foil the underhanded plot of

the elven overlords of the Lendore Isles!

CHARACTER HOOKS

There are several ways that you can introduce your

PCs to this particular adventure. Pick one of these and

adapt it as needed or use them as inspiration for your

own introduction to the adventure!

The characters are on their way to the port city of

Restenford  for  some  rest  and  relaxation  between

adventures.

The  PCs  are  carrying  a  message  to  the  baroness

from  a  leader  or  local  bard  who  once  stayed  with

the baroness as a guest.

A  local  caravan  needs  some  guards,  and  the  PCs

suit just fine. Allow the characters to learn that the

city of Restenford, the last stop on their trip, is hav-

ing some crime problems.

THE HANGED

HIGHWAYMAN

The whole adventure starts with an ambush. Then the

party can investigate the strange crime wave going on

in Restenford.

Encounter 1: On the Road (EL 7)

Read or paraphrase the following aloud:

The road is well used, and bushes, rocks, and

various types of brushy plants make the journey

only a little less monotonous. Sometimes larger

rock outcroppings provide a bit of distraction for

the eye, and you can see copses of trees here and

there just off the road.

Let the players roleplay a bit before you get to the

ambush. Here are some suggestions for distractions:

A  couple  of  squirrels  chase  each  other  across  the

road  at  the  PCs  feet,  then  head  for  some  nearby

trees.

A cloud of gnats hovers around a specific PC.

A nearby tree has a fallen bird or bird nest under it,

DMs choice. The PCs should make a Listen check

(DC 10) to hear the weak chirping of a bird (or baby

birds if the season is right). If they hear it, they can

easily find the fallen nest or bird(s).

As the PCs approach a bend in the road, bandits

attack.

Creatures: Three bandits hide behind a rocky out-

cropping at a bend in the road to ambush the party. A

successful Spot check (use the rules on pages 5960 of

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide; terrain is considered light

forest at this juncture and the bandits are still) reveals

the presence of the group.

d Bandits (3): Male and female human Rog3/Ftr1;

CR 4; Medium-size humanoid; HD 3d6+3 plus 1d10+1;

hp 19; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 18 (touch 12, flat-footed

18);  Atk  +7  melee  (1d8+2/1920,  masterwork

longsword) or +6 ranged (1d8/1920, masterwork light

crossbow); SA Sneak attack (+2d6); SQ Evasion, traps,

uncanny dodge (Dex bonus to AC); AL CN; SV Fort +4,

Ref +5, Will +1; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 11,

Cha 8.

Lips +2, Ride (horse) +5, Search +6, Sense Motive +6,

Spot +6, Tumble +8, Use Magic Device +5; Dodge, Mobil-

ity, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (longsword).

2

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally

allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for

half damage, a bandit takes no damage with a success-

ful saving throw.

Possessions (each): +1 studded leather armor, +1 buckler,

masterwork longsword, masterwork light crossbow, 20

bolts, potion of hiding (2 bandits) or potion of invisibility

(bandit leader), 200 gp.

Tactics: Unless the PCs are attempting to slip into

town undetected, the bandits hear the partys approach

in time to drink their potions. The two with potions of

hiding raise their Hide bonuses by +10, and the third

(the leader) becomes invisible and circles around to the

other side of the road so as to be in a good position for

flanking when combat begins.

If the PCs fail to spot the bandits as they hide, the two

in hiding attack first with their light crossbows, using

the natural formations of the rock as cover (one-half ),

then draw their longswords when the PCs start to close.

The invisible bandit holds his attack until the charac-

ters have closed with his fellows, then maneuvers to

flank a PC (preferably a spellcaster) for a sneak attack.

Any bandits that the party captures alive and questions

reveal that they are all independents who joined forces

several weeks ago. At present, they are in search of a

magic item called the glorious hand, which they believe

to be in the keeping of travelers coming into Resten-

ford. While searching the campsite outside of town for

valuables after a raid a few days ago, one of them found a

scrap of paper in a dead campfire. The paper, currently

in the possession of the leader, reads as follows: eagerly

await the arrival of the Glorious Handw [illegible] an we

not achieve [illegible] in our clutches [illegible]. The ban-

dits do not know what this item does, but they believe it

to be of great power and have every confidence in their

ability to make use of it once they find it.

A successful bardic knowledge check (DC 20) allows a

character to remember a few scattered lines from an old

ballad he once heard:

dum de dum, dont understand

tallow drips on withered hand

neath shadow of a gallows pole

I took (something, something),

fingers dance and I stretch and yawn

Hand of Glory.

The song refers to a magic item called a hand of glory

(see Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide), but a

successful Spellcraft check (DC 15) is required to recall

its specific powers. Failure on this check reveals only

one power of the item (see invisibility). Such a clue may

actually mislead the party into thinking theres some

kind of invisible creature on the prowl. A successful

bardic knowledge or Knowledge (arcana) check (DC

35) reveals that the term glorious hand was long ago used

to describe a different necromantic magic item manu-

factured from the left hand of a hanged criminal. It

does not, however, reveal that items powers.

Encounter 2: At Restenford

Upon arriving in Restenford, the characters may settle

at the inn of their choice and take care of any town busi-

ness they may have. Wherever they decide to stay, the

innkeeper, a middle-aged man named Grezius, recog-

nizes the bard as an entertainer and asks him or her to

put on a show that evening. In exchange for one nights

entertainment, he offers free lodging for the bard, plus

free dinner for the whole party. (See Encounter 3 when

youre  ready to have the actual performance.)

From here, the characters may investigate the mystery

through any means they desire. A successful Diplo-

macy check (DC 10) made while a character chats for

awhile with Grezius or any ordinary townsfolk reveals

that there has recently been a daring series of burgla-

ries in Restenford. The first took place about two weeks

ago, and since then one has occurred every night or so.

One or two people, apparently unfortunate enough to

surprise the burglars in the act, were murdered, seem-

ingly without having put up a struggle. None of the

ordinary citizens have ever heard of a glorious hand or of

any  unusual  magic  item  being  brought  into  town

recently.

Checking with the following persons and organiza-

tions reveals the information listed below (no check

required unless noted):

The  Local  Wizard:  The  wizard  is  a  recluse  who

refuses  to  see  anyone.  His  apprentice,  a  comely

young lady, turns away all callers politely. (Should a

character press the issue, go to Encounter 4.)

The  Church:  There  have  been  no  undead  sight-

ings  here  in  several  years.  The  church  has  tried

very hard to keep down undead problems, and they

are quite happy to report this, even if the PCs ask

other questions. This is definitely a dead end, but

feel free to allow the party to interact with all man-

ner of church authorities.

The Thieves Guild: Though it takes several hours

and a least one Gather Information check (DC 17)

to discover the guild, the PCs can certainly try to

3

find  it.  If  they  succeed,  they  must  deal  with  the

rather  paranoid  (Unfriendly)  thieves.  Should  the

bard  deal  diplomatically  with  the  bunch  (use  the

rules  for  dealing  with  NPC  attitudes  in  the

DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide on  page  149),  the  group

can  find  out  more  about  what  is  going  on  in  the

town.  First  off,  nobody  has  hocked  or  fenced  the

stolen  goods  locally,  and  no  one  knows  whos

behind  the  burglaries.  A  successful  Diplomacy

check (DC 15) reveals that the guild knows of an

abandoned secret hideout of an old thieves guild

somewhere in town, but none of the current guild

members  know  where  it  is.  (The  only  place  this

information can be found is the city records, which

are  kept  in  the  baronesss  manor  house;  see

Encounters 57.)

thereafter  as  a  warning

The City Guard: The local law enforcement (the

City Guard) has beefed up patrols in the mercan-

tile sector in response to the burglaries. A success-

ful Gather Information check (DC 15) reveals that

the  last  public  execution  took  place  about  six

weeks ago. The guard hanged the notorious high-

wayman Reynard and displayed his body for some

weeks

to  others.

(Characters wishing to pursue this line of inquiry

must  consult  the  guards  at  the  north  gate,  who

claim  that  nothing  was  unusual  about  the  hang-

ing, the display of the body, or the burial. Ravella,

the guard who was actually on duty at the time of

the burial, is out of town and wont be back for two

more days. If the PCs press the matter, they learn

that she is helping her sister while her sisters hus-

band is off on some undisclosed errand that took

him away from his family.) Go to Encounter 9 for

more information.

Encounter 3: Showtime!

On the evening of the first day, the bard may be per-

forming: If the bard agreed to put on a show for patrons

of the inn, Grezius calls upon him or her to fulfill that

promise now. At least three dozen patronspeasants,

merchants, farmers, and even a few petty noblespack

the tavern, for the people of Restenford are eager for

anything that might take their minds off the current

situation. Their faces are lined with worry and they

jump at the smallest sounds.

If the bard makes a successful Perform check (DC 15),

one of the petty nobles later describes the performance

in glowing terms to Baroness Andrella, ruler of Resten-

ford (see Encounter 5). The bard also may attempt any

of the various bardic music effects he can produce to

comfort the patrons or gain their cooperation.

Nothing untoward happens during the evening or the

night. The villain is biding his time and waiting to see

whether  the  strangers  will  move  on  of  their  own

accord.

Encounter 4: The Wizard

(EL Variable)

When (or if ) any of the characters make a second

attempt to visit Barellus, the local wizard, use this

encounter.

A successful Diplomacy check (DC 10) made to gain

information about the wizard from the townsfolk any-

time prior to this encounter reveals that he is old and

cantankerous. Success at a higher level (DC 15) reveals

that he is impatient with those who waste his time, par-

ticularly garrulous townsfolk who cant seem to get to

the point. Those who approach him in a businesslike

manner have no problems talking with him. Likewise,

a Diplomacy check (DC 10) made to discover informa-

tion about his apprentice reveals that her name is

Serena, she is a half-elf, she adores roses, she is afraid of

spiders, and she is very interested in antiques.

The wizards tower stands on the outskirts of town. All

along the path leading up to it are signs reading No

Tresspassing. The door is secured with both a mechani-

cal lock (Open Lock DC 20) and an arcane lock (caster

level 10). The only windows are on the top (fourth)

floor of the tower.

If the characters knock, Serena greets them. She has

orders to turn away all visitors, which she usually does

very efficiently. However, a successful opposed check

with Bluff, Intimidate, or Diplomacy against her Sense

Motive check result convinces her to admit them.

Apply a +2 bonus to the check if the PC attempting this

brings her roses or an antique as a gift or promises her

information  about  a  valuable  antique.  Apply  a  2

penalty should a character try to use a spider (or the

threat of one) against her. (She shuts the door against

them and runs up to Barellus to warn him of the nasty

people who want to see him.)

If they convince her to let them see Barellus, she leads

them to his study on the top floor, where he is perusing

an ancient tome. She introduces them as strangers who

need his advice. In this case, his initial attitude is indif-

ferent. If they enter by any other means, his initial atti-

tude is hostile, and he attacks them as intruders with

his wand and spells before asking any questions.

4

Assuming the characters get to speak with Barellus,

he greets them gruffly. Read aloud the following:

Adventurers,  eh?  the  old  wizards  scowls.

Make it fast. You found a magic bauble in some

musty old dungeon and you want to know what

it does? Your friend got turned into a toad and

you want him changed back? You want a new

spell for your spellbooks? Well, spit it out! I

havent got all day!

If the characters do anything other than state their

business without preamble, Barellus orders them from

his presence and refuses to talk with them any further.

Should the characters be open and forthright with him,

however, he invites them to sit and talk. A successful

Charisma check (DC 15) at this point converts his atti-

tude to friendly, or to helpful (DC 30).

If the PCs get him to chat, Barellus is happy to tell

them what he knows about a hand of glory (all its powers

as listed in Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide).

If any character repeats the fragment of the ballad relat-

ing to a hand of glory (from Encounter 1), the old mans

eyes light up with recognition. I remember that song

. . . it was based on a tale that everyone thought was a

legend. But it wasnt. I once read a dusty old treatise on

how to make a necromantic item called a glorious hand.

It was a five-pointed candle made from the left hand of

a hanged murderer, and it could open any lock and

hold fast anyone other than the wielder who saw it

happen.

The old wizard knows no more than this, and he has

no real concept of what has been happening in town

recently.

Should the characters try to fight these two, they have

a tough battle on their hands. The treasure within the

tower consists primarily of old books relating to magic

and legends, for the wizard became a sage after his

retirement from adventuring. There are also a few

potions, scrolls, and 2,000 gp (secreted inside a fake

book).

Encounter 5: An Invitation

If the bard impressed the local nobility with the per-

formance the previous night (see Encounter 3), the PCs

have a chance to see the baroness. Upon returning to

the inn, the bard finds a special invitation awaiting him

or her. The local ruler, Baroness Andrella, heard such

good reports about his concert that she wants a special

performance at the manor tonightin just a few hours

time, in fact. If the bard accepts, the entire party is wel-

come at Andrellas manor. Go to Encounter 6 after the

PCs have a chance to react and ready themselves.

Encounter 6: The Show of Shows

(EL Variable)

If the bard has received and accepted an invitation to

perform at the manor house (see Encounter 5), or if the

PCs request permission to examine the city records,

they can visit the baroness. In the latter case, the

baroness requests a performance from the bard in

exchange for permissionif she can tell that the group

includes an entertainer. If not, the PCs can gain permis-

sion if they can convince her with a successful Diplo-

macy check (DC 20) that such access is vital to solving

the recent string of burglaries. (See Encounter 7 if the

PCs get permission to research the city records.)

If the bard puts on a show for Andrella, the guard cap-

tain warns the PCs upon their arrival that the baroness

does not take kindly to attempts to influence her with

magic of any sort. If they agree to a magic-free evening,

they are ushered into the baronesss presence. At least

six minor nobles and the baronesss wizard are also

present for the show. A Perform check result of 25 or

higher for the bards performance indicates that the

baroness is so pleased that she offers to grant the char-

acter a request. If the request is for permission to exam-

ine the city records, she grants it with the caveat that no

papers leave the manor house. If it is for a gift (such as a

magic item), she freely gives items worth up to 1,000

gp. The DM is free to evaluate any other requests using

these guidelines.

The baronesss wizard is watching the characters

throughout the show for attempts to use magic. Should

the characters attempt spells, bardic music effects, or

any other form of magic, the wizard automatically

detects the attempt unless the characters attempt to

mask it with Disguise Spell and/or ambient song. If he

detects the attempt, he first tries to cast hold person,

then informs the baroness of it. She coldly orders the

PCs from her presence and refuses all further requests

for audience.

If a fight breaks out here, the characters really dont

have a chance unless they try to escape. The foes on

hand include the court wizard (use the stats for Barel-

lus from Encounter 4), the guard captain (a standard

9th-level NPC human fighter from Chapter 2 of the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide), two sergeants (standard 7th-

level NPC human fighters), two clerics (standard 7th-

level NPC human clerics), and three dozen guards on

duty (standard 3rd-level NPC human fighters). More

guards can come as the alert spreads, up to a total of 50

within the first two minutes of combat. If the battle

lasts more than five minutes, the alert can draw in

another 50 guards from the outlying areas, and then

another 50 after that, plus one sergeant for every 25

guards present. Its really in the best interests of the

PCs to try to get out instead of face down a citys

worth of guards.

Encounter 7: Research

Should the PCs gain permission from the baroness to

examine the city records , they can enter the records

room of her manor house..

The steward (human Exp4) shows the characters to

the records room and stays with them while they

peruse the records, but he does not assist them in locat-

ing anything. They may take as long as they like in the

records room.

The Gather Information skill is no help here, but each

successful Search check uncovers some nugget of

useful information. The following details are available

through records research:

The first of the strange burglaries occurred only a

few  weeks  after  the  last  public  executionthe

hanging  of  a  notorious  highwayman  named

Reynard.

6

The  highwayman  was  hanged  at  the  gallows  on

the  north  side  of  town,  and  the  City  Guard  kept

his body on display for several weeks thereafter at

the  north  gate  as  a  deterrent  to  other  would-be

criminals.

The abandoned thieves lair is located in a portion

of  what  is  now  the  citys  sewers.  The  document

that reveals this information also recounts a pub-

lic  proclamation  that  all  the  passages  leading  to

this section were filled in when Andrellas father

broke up the old guild. (A successful Search check

[DC 25] at this point reveals that though the for-

mer baron announced that he had destroyed the

lair, he may not actually have done so. There is a

decided  lack  of  passage-filling  supplies  ordered

during that time , and all other expenditures look

normal  for  the  period  when  compared  to  the

months  just  before  and  just  after  the  proclama-

tion.)

Encounter 8: The Sewers

(EL Variable)

When the characters discover the location of the

secret hideout of the former thieves guild, they can

begin exploring in earnest.

To reach the section of sewer where the entrance to

the abandoned lair purportedly lies (see Encounter 8A

for lair details), the characters must enter the vast net-

work of sewer passages through a street-level access

point on the north side of town and traverse at least one

mile of dark, crumbling passageways. These passages

connect stormwater drains, catacombs, trash pits, and

other unsavory areas. A number of equally unsavory

creatures call them home.

As  with  wandering  monster  rolls  in  a  dungeon,

theres a base 10% chance per hour that characters can

encounter something in the city sewers. In addition,

theres a 10% chance every time they make noise or

visit a high-traffic area within the sewer network that

they can encounter a monster. The DM may use the

table for the desired encounter level from among

those presented on the next page. These tables are sim-

ilar to the Dungeon Encounters tables in the Adven-

tures chapter of the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide, but they

feature more creatures that would be at home in a

cramped, urban environment. Although even a 3rd-

level encounter may be nothing more than a nuisance

for characters of this partys level, it is rare to find any

creatures more dangerous than these living in a citys

sewers.

Encounter 8A: Abandoned Lair

Entrance (EL 8)

The PCs eventually reach the abandoned lair during

their explorations.

Creatures: Two otyughs (see creature entries in the

MONSTER MANUAL) have made their lair in a particularly

large and disgusting pile of refuse in the section of

sewer where the abandoned lair is located. Their eye-

stalks protrude just above the refuse; the rest of their

bodies are concealed by the muck.

d Otyughs (2): hp 32, 38, see MONSTER MANUAL pages

147148.

Once the characters have defeated the two otyughs, a

successful Search check (DC 15) in the refuse pile

reveals their treasure: a bag containing 500 gp, one tour-

maline (200 gp), one deep blue spinel (475 gp), one aqua-

marine (600 gp), a masterwork dagger, and a chain shirt.

Trap: A successful Search check (DC 20) for secret

doors reveals one in the opposite wall of this passage. The

secret door is trapped with a wide pit in front of it. There

is a hidden bypass switch 6 feet to the left of the door.

a Wide-Mouth Pit Trap: CR 6; mechanical; loca-

tion  trigger,  manual  reset;  hidden  switch  bypass

(Search DC 30); Reflex save (DC 25) avoids; 40 ft. deep

(4d6, fall); multiple targets (all targets within a 10-ft. by

10-ft. area); Search (DC 26); Disable Device (DC 25).

Market Price: 30,600 gp.

Encounter 8B: Abandoned Lair

(EL 4)

Beyond the door, a passage leads into the darkness. It

splits into two passageways about 100 feet from the

door, and on either side, three empty chambers open

from its twisting length. The corridors in the section

beyond this door have not been filled inin fact, they

are in remarkably good condition for an abandoned

lair. Though the passages are dark and dank, the walls

and floors seem clean. Both passages eventually con-

verge at a single chamber.

Creatures: Several dire rats (pets of the spymaster)

call this chamber home and attack any intruders.

d Dire Rats (12): hp 5 each, see MONSTER MANUAL

pages 5658.

Its clear that someone has been using this place lately.

All the stolen loot is here, though oddly enough, its

scattered about carelessly, and some of it has spoiled

through neglect or been chewed by the dire rats. In one

corner lies a skeleton dressed in a few remnants of dark

cloth. (This is the body of the necromancer, which the

dire rats have devoured. Sirius has taken his bracers of

armor +2 and his wand of inflict serious wounds.)

A successful Search check (DC 15) reveals some elven

clothing, a scrap of paper, and a disguise kit. Examina-

tion of the latter and a successful Disguise check (DC

15) reveals that someone, probably a male elf, has been

using this kit to disguise himself as a human.

The scrap of paper has a couple of symbols placed at

various places, though its torn. A successful Decipher

Script check (DC 20) allows the reader to figure out

that the symbols stand for several locations: a mill, a

smithy, a stable, an inn, a tavern, five residences (resi-

dence is the general notationno proper names are

mentioned), six warehouses, and a lighthouse. Marks

are made next to the inn, the tavern, the lighthouse,

two of the residences, and two warehouses. If the PCs

check into these marks by talking to people at each

location, they can discover that these places had an

incidence of theft within the last two weekswith the

exception of the lighthouse. (See The Culprit for the

encounter at the lighthouse.) Heres a quick list of

NPCs at each location and the main things they say:

Inn (Sea Maidens Dream): Innkeeper Surave (NG

male human War7/Exp7) says he lost his weekly stash.

It amounted to about 100 gp in assorted coinage.

Tavern (The Wallowing Sow): Tavernkeeper Yolana

(N female human War4/Exp7) tells the PCs she lost her

evenings take, which amounted to about 10 gp in

assorted coinage.

Lambent  Residence: Alean  Lambent  (LG  male

human Exp4) lets the PCs know that he and his wife

lost a family gemstonea red spinel. He also lost about

25 gp. Alean had hoped to have the gemstone set into a

piece of jewelry or something for his wife, who is cur-

rently away from home.

Fenard Residence: Nellie Fenard (LG female human

Ftr10), a widow, tells the PCs that she lost her savings,

which amounted to about 250 gp. Thankfully, she

scared  away  the  rogue  before  he  could  get  to  her

weapon and armor stash. (She might be willing to show

the PCs her nice weapons and armor or even sell them

if the DM wishes to introduce a few magic items into

the game to rid the PCs of some money. A successful

Diplomacy check [DC 20] can persuade the former

fighter to dig out her items. She doesnt let the PCs

know where she hides them, though.)

Selan Warehouses: The supervisor on duty, Magnus

Firehand (CG male human War7), tells the PCs that he

lost a black pearl and 200 gp one night, as well as some

supplies like flour, sugar, and a length of mauve silk

fabric worth 100 gp. The supplies were in a different

warehouse than the black pearl. Hell give the PCs the

fabric if they can come up with the black pearl; it

belongs to a customer of his boss, as does the silk, but

the silk is already reported as lost to that particular cus-

tomer. The pearl isnt. If asked, Magnus thinks only one

person is responsible for these thefts, due to the rela-

tively small loss he sustained that evening. He is rather

astonished that he didnt lose more, but he thinks the

supplies loaded down the thief to the point where he

had to leave or get caught.

Encounter 9: The Hanged Man

Should  the  PCs  follow  up  on  the  clue  about  the

hanged highwayman, they can discover some more

information, but only if they have their wits about

them.

The hanged highwaymans remains were displayed for

several weeks near the towns north gate, which over-

looks the graveyard. Ravella, the guard assigned to that

post at the time of the hanging, is out of town when the

PCs arrive in Restenford, but is available two days

thereafter. She is willing to talk with the party, but a

successful Sense Motive check (DC 15) reveals a wari-

ness about her, as if there were something about the sit-

uation she wishes to hide.

Ravella answers the PCs questions truthfully, explain-

ing that the corpse was cut from the gallows and hung

on the outside of the city wall above the north gate for

display. Her tower post allowed her full view of it at

night, when she was on duty. If the PCs ask whether

anyone could have approached the corpse while it was

displayed, she insists that no one came near it the

whole time it was hanging there, though her manner

becomes somewhat less relaxed than it was before. A

successful Intimidate check (DC 15) or suggestion to tell

the truth at this point causes her to confess that she

thought she saw someone messing around with the

body one night. She was sure that shed chased the mis-

creant off before any damage was done, but in the

morning she discovered to her horror that the corpses

left hand had been neatly severed at the wrist. Afraid of

getting in trouble for dereliction of duty, she buried the

body the next day, claiming that it was beginning to fall

apart. If further pressed, she shows the PCs the site of

the highwaymans unmarked grave in the graveyard.

(See Encounter 10.) She buried the body about two

weeks ago.

9

Encounter 10: A Double Grave

If the PCs wish to examine the highwaymans body,

they can find a further clue that could lead them to the

spymaster behind the plot.

Attempts to exhume the highwaymans body without

permission from the baroness or the guard captain result

in arrest if the PCs are caught. Since the graveyard is

within sight of both guard towers, which are manned

day and night, digging up a body by stealth is nearly

impossible. If the PCs approach the baroness with the

guard and her story, however, Andrella readily grants

them permission to exhume the highwaymans corpse.

Exhuming the corpse not only confirms Ravellas

story but also reveals that the grave has two occupants

rather than one! The other body is that of the local

lighthouse keeper, who has obviously been dead for

weeks. Ravella truthfully claims ignorance of how the

extra body came to be in the crude coffin, though she

does recall that the coffin seemed unusually heavy

when she and the guard assisting her with the burial

lowered it into the grave. A successful Search check

(DC 15) reveals that the coffin lid was pried up with a

metal instrument after being sealed, then subsequently

refastened.

Should the PCs inquire about the lighthouse keeper

in town, the locals claim to have seen him purchasing

supplies at Malkas competitor only the other day. They

mention that the lighthouse keeper usually heads over

to Malkas store for his supplies. If asked, Malka men-

tions that he thinks it odd that the lighthouse keeper

Bomarc hasnt stopped by to pick up his flour and other

longer-term supplies. Bomarc was due in last week, and

he picks up his order every 45 days.

THE CULPRIT

This section contains the climax of the adventure. It

occurs whenever the characters decide to visit the

lighthouse and confront the fake keeper, an elf spymas-

ter named Sirius.

The lighthouse is located on the edge of town, on a

rugged, rocky outcropping overlooking the coast. It is

four stories tall, with the upper story consisting of the

light apparatus. Each of the lower three stories consists

of a single, round room with a stairway leading up

through the center.

Sirius does not respond to knocks or calls, since he

knows full well that the lighthouse keeper never had

visitors. If alerted to the presence of strangers by any

noise, he hides behind the floor-length curtains cover-

ing the windows in the third-floor bedroom, drinking

his potions when intruders seem to be near.

Sirius and his partner made a number of modifica-

tions to the lighthouse. They installed traps with bypass

elements that only Sirius now knows about on each

floor  and  at  the  entrance.  The  money  for  these

improvements came from their employers.

1. Entrance (EL 7)

The door of the lighthouse is trapped with a dart trap.

a Fusillade of Greenblood Darts: CR 7; mechani-

cal;  location  trigger;  manual  reset;  hidden  switch

bypass (Search DC 25); Atk +18 ranged (1d4+1 plus

poison, dart); poison (greenblood oil, Fortitude save

[DC 13] resists, 1 Con/1d2 Con); multiple targets (1d8

darts per target in a 10-ft. by 10-ft. area); Search (DC 25);

Disable Device (DC 25). Market Price: 34,400 gp.

2. First Floor (EL 7)

The first floor room is a living room furnished with an

overstuffed couch and chairs, bookcases, and two small

tables. Stepping on the bottom step of the spiral stair-

case without flicking the hidden bypass switch on the

railing causes the door to close (if it is not closed

already), the stairway to collapse, and a trapdoor to seal

the ceiling hole where the stairway accessed the second

floor. It also triggers a gas trap.

a Burnt Othur Vapor Trap: CR 7; mechanical;

location trigger; repair reset; hidden switch bypass

(Search DC 35); gas; multiple targets (all targets in a

10-ft. by 10-ft. room); never-miss; onset delay (3

rounds); poison (burnt other fumes, Fortitude save

[DC 18] resists, 1 Con [permanent drain]/3d6 Con);

Search (DC 21); Disable Device (DC 21). Market Price:

21,700 gp.

The collapsed stairway requires time and materials to

repair. The ceiling is 10 feet high, and the wooden

trapdoor to the second floor is locked (Open Lock DC

25). If the characters get it open, they can grab onto

the end of the stairway above and climb up to the

second floor.

3. Second Floor (EL 6)

This floor is the kitchen and dining area. A wood stove

vents to the outside, and a small counter and cupboards

hold pots, pans, and nonperishable foods. A large table

with one chair serves as the dining area. At present, the

kitchen is littered with pans and jars holding various

CONCLUSION

If Sirius is losing the battle, he surrenders. Should the

PCs defeat Sirius without killing him, he admits that

the elven overlords of the Lendore Isles sent him here

to destabilize Restenford (one of the few remaining

human-ruled towns in the area), hoping the baroness

would waive the towns autonomy and call on the elves

for help. Naturally, he claims diplomatic immunity

after confessing his crimes. If the PCs kill him, there is

enough evidence in his belongings to reveal the source

of his funding. Hidden in the bedroom of the light-

house is an additional 800 gp, one red spinel (300 gp),

and one black pearl (850 gp). The PCs can also find the

supplies stolen from the warehouses, though the food

supplies were obviously used.

foul-smelling preparations. These are the poisons that

Sirius has been brewing (DMs choice as to types).

The trap on this floor is whirling poisoned blades.

They attack anyone who comes into the room unless

the hidden lock bypass near the stove is activated.

a Whirling Poisoned Blades: CR 6; mechanical;

timed trigger; automatic reset; hidden lock bypass

(Search [DC 25], Open Lock [DC 30]); Atk +10 melee

(1d4+4/1920 plus poison, dagger); poison (purple

worm  poison,  Fortitude  save  [DC  24]  resists,  1d6

Str/1d6 Str); multiple targets (one target in each of

three preselected 5-ft. squares); Search (DC 20); Disable

Device (DC 20). Market Price: 30,200 gp.

4. Third Floor (EL 8)

This floor serves as the bedroom. On one side is the

bed; on the other side is a large window covered with

drapes behind which an invisible Sirius hides. This

room is trapped with a set of poisoned spikes that fire at

anyone stepping on the floor if the hidden bypass

switch on the staircase is not flipped.

a Poisoned Wall Spikes: CR 5; mechanical; loca-

tion trigger; manual reset; Atk +16 melee (1d8+4 plus

poison, spike); multiple targets (closest target in each of

two adjacent 5-ft. squares); poison (Medium-size spider

venom, Fortitude save [DC 14] resists, 1d4 Str/1d6 Str);

Search (DC 17); Disable Device (DC 21). Market Price:

13,150 gp.

When the PCs enter, Sirius first uses the glorious

hand to hold as many of them as possible. Then, if the

characters begin searching the room, he attacks with

his wand, then finally his short sword. If they begin

climbing to the top of the tower, he waits until the last

mobile PC is left in the room before attacking that

one.

Song and Silence FAQ

3/6/03

The Pyro feat from Song and Silence seems to say that the

feat gives you +1 point of damage per die of damage you

deal  with  any  spell  that  has  the  fire  descriptor.  At  least

thats what my players think. Is this true? Can a fireball

cast by a 6th-level character with the Pyro feat deal 6d6+6

points of damage? Will Aganazars scorcher also deal the

extra point per die? There are so many; the list could go

on and on. Some other spells my players are asking about

are  burning  hands,  fire  shield,  wall  of  fire,  and  flame

arrow.

The  Pyro  feat  lets  you  deal  extra  damage  when  you  set

something  on  fire  (such  as  when  you  use  alchemists  fire).

See Catching On Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide.  Most  fire  spells  dont  set  anything  on  fire,  and  even

fewer set creatures on fire.

As  noted  in  the  DUNGEON  MASTERs  Guide,  no  spell  with

an instantaneous duration sets a creature on fire, so the Pyro

feat  wont  grant  you  any  extra  damage  from  Aganazars

scorcher, burning hands, or fireball.

The flames from the warm version of the fire shield spell

do not set creatures or objects on fire.

You can set objects alight with a flaming projectile using a

flame  arrow  spell,  but  not  creatures.  If  you  set  fire  to  an

object with a flaming projectile, the object takes 1d6 points of

fire damage per round, starting the round after it was hit, or

1d6+1 points of damage per round if you have the Pyro feat.

The fiery bolts from a flame arrow spell do not set creatures

or objects on fire.

Can  you  take  the  Dash  feat  more  than  once  and  stack

the speed increase?

You  cant  take  a  feat  more  than  once  unless  the  feat

specifically says you can. (Dash doesnt say you can.)

The Hamstring feat allows you to use a sneak attack to

lessen  a  creatures  speed.  Can  you  hamstring  a  creature

more  than  once  and  quarter  its  movement?  How  about

using it to strike a wing instead of a leg to halve its flying

speed?

Multiple  hamstring  effects  dont  stack,  except  where

specifically  noted  otherwise;  for  example,  you  have  to

hamstring a quadruped twice to lessen its speed by half. Note

that  once  you  lessen  a  quadrupeds  speed,  additional

hamstring effects dont stack.

You  cant  hamstring  a  wing  to  lessen  flying  speed.  The

Hamstring feat works only against a creatures land speed, as

noted in the feat description.

Why are creatures with more than four legs immune to

the  Hamstring  feat?  Why  couldnt  you  hamstring  a  six-

legged  creature  three  times  and  lessen  its  speed  by  half?

Also,  the  feat  description  says  the  movement  reduction

lasts 24 hours or until a successful Heal check. Whats the

DC for the Heal check?

While  I  suppose  you  could  hamstring  just  about  anything

by  successfully  hitting  half  its  legs,  the  process  gets  absurd

after awhile. For example, youd be much better off making

four  regular  sneak  attacks  against  a  monstrous  spider  than

you  would  be  if  you  tried  to  hamstring  it  four  times.  In

addition,  most  things  that  have  more  than  four  legs  dont

really  have  hamstrings.  In  any  case,  creatures  must  be

vulnerable  to  sneak  attacks  to  be  susceptible  to  hamstring

attacks. For example, you cannot hamstring a golem or other

construct because you cant sneak attack a construct.

It  takes  a  Heal  check  (DC  15)  to  remove  the  speed  loss

from a hamstring attack.

I  found  the  description  for  the  Quicker  Than  the  Eye

feat  confusing.  Do  you  get  an  actual  extra  partial  action

granted  to  you  if  any  foe  (even  1  out  of  20  goblins)  fails

the Spot check? Or is this feat meant to just allow you to

make one attack after bluffing in the same round?

Quicker Than the Eye doesnt give you any extra actions.

Creatures  that  fail  their  Spot  checks  just  dont  see  what

youre doing for the rest of the round.

Once  you  make  your  Bluff  check  (as  a  move-equivalent

action) you can do just about anything with the remainder of

your  round.  Because  you  have  already  made  a  move-

equivalent  action,  you  have  only  a  partial  action  left.  You

could use that partial action to attack, move, use a skill, cast a

spell,  or  any  one  of  a  number  of  other  things  (see  Partial

Actions in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook).

Note  that  what you  can  do  after  the  Bluff  check  does  not

depend at all on the outcome of your opponents Spot checks,

but  any  opponent  who  makes  a  successful  Spot  check

observes what you do with your partial action.

Suppose  Im  a  rogue  with  the  Expert  Tactician  feat

from  Sword  and  Fist  and  the  Quicker  Than  the  Eye  feat

from Song and Silence. If Im in melee with an opponent

and use a move-equivalent action to Bluff my foe and get

him  to  look  away,  can  I  do  the  extra  attack  from  the

Expert  Tactician  feat?  If  I  do  that,  can  I  then  use  my

remaining partial action to run away? What happens if I

use my partial action to use Bluff again? Can I then make

a second free attack?

An opponent who fails to detect your Bluff when you use

Quicker Than the Eye does not see the partial action you take

after  the  Bluff,  so  your  opponent  is  denied  his  Dexterity

bonus against your melee attacks. If you also have the Expert

Tactician feat, you can make an immediate free attack against

a foe who failed his Spot check against your Bluff. Once you

do  so,  that  opponent  is  observing  you  again,  and  that

opponent  will  observe  you  if  you  try  to  run  away  after  the

free  attack.  Because  the  attack  you  make  by  virtue  of  your

Expert  Tactician  feat  is  a  free  action,  you  could  attempt  to

use  Quicker  Than  the  Eye  again,  but  your  opponent  should

get a bonus on the Spot check. The second Bluff check also is

a  move-equivalent  action,  so  you  would  be  done  acting  for

the  round.  If  the  second  Bluff  check  succeeded,  however,

your opponent would once again not see you, and you could

make  another  free  attack  by  virtue  of  your  Expert  Tactician

feat.

The  virtuoso  prestige  class  from  Song  and  Silence  has

an ability called sustaining song. The description for this

ability  mentions  something  called  a  stabilization  check.

What is a stabilization check? Also, sustaining song lasts

for  5  minutes  or  until  the  virtuoso  stops  performing.

What does that mean?

The phrase stabilization check refers to the 10% chance

a dying character has to become stable each round (see Dying

Song and Silence FAQ

2

3/6/03

in  Chapter  8  of  the  Players  Handbook).  While  a  sustaining

song is in effect, a dying character does not check to become

stable  each  round  and  does  not  automatically  lose  any  hit

points for not becoming stable.

A  sustaining  song  lasts  for  a  maximum  of  5  minutes  or

until the virtuoso stops the sustaining song effect, whichever

comes first.

The  virtuoso  prestige  class  also  has  an  ability  called

language-

language-dependent  ability.  What

dependent ability?

A language-dependent effect uses intelligible language as a

medium.  If  the  subject  cannot  understand  what  the  ability

user says, the effect fails. Language dependent is a standard

descriptor for spells and other magical effects. It is described

under Descriptors in Chapter 10 of the Players Handbook.

When  a  virtuoso  at  1st  level  gets  the  bardic  music

ability, does she also get one additional use of this ability

per  level  like  the  bard?  If  the  virtuoso  also  has  bard

levels, can the character use her daily virtuoso allotment

of bardic music for bard music abilities? Can she use her

daily bard allotment of bardic music for bard levels, and

can  she  use  her  daily  virtuoso  allotment  of  bardic  music

for virtuoso music abilities?

Yes to all. Uses of bardic music from the virtuoso and bard

classes are completely interchangeable. Add up the daily uses

of  bardic  music  for  each  class.  The  character  can  expend

these on any bardic music ability her bard or virtuoso classes

make available to her.

The short description of the harmonize spell on page 88

of  Song  and  Silence  says  the  spell  pools  the  talents  of

multiple  bards  to  grant  one  of  them  extra  temporary

ranks  of  Perform.  When  you  read  the  full  description  of

the spell on page 92, however, it says the spell grants the

lead performer a circumstance bonus on Perform checks

equal  to  +1  per  three  bard  levels  of  the  backup

performers. Which is correct?

The spell description is correct.

The  healthful  slumber  spell  from  Song  and  Silence

doubles the subjects natural healing rate. The Heal skill

allows for long-term care that also doubles the recipients

natural healing rate. Does a character who receives both

long-term care and a  healthful slumber spell heal at four

times the normal rate?

You dont multiply multipliersyou combine them into a

single  multiplier  instead. Each  extra  multiple  adds  +1  to the

original  multiplier,  so  two  doublings  triple  the  original  (see

page 275 in the Players Handbook). In the case of healthful

slumber  plus  successful  long-term  care,  a  subject  regains  3

hit points per level per day of light activity, or 4.5 hit points

per level per day of complete bed rest.
