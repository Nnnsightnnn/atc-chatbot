truth  presupposes  error.  It  is  these  mingled  opposites  which  people  our  life,  which  make  it  pungent,  intoxicating.  We  only  exist  in  terms  of  this

conflict, in the zone where black and white clash.Louis Aragon (1897-1982).

Welcome to the Book of Exalted Deeds.

Introduction

There is an obvious parallel between this book and its prede-

cessor,  the  Book  of Vile  Darkness. Both  are  named  after  minor

artifacts  detailed  in  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide, artifacts  that

define the sharp polarity between the most abhorrent pits of

evil and the highest peaks of righteousness. While the Book of

Vile Darkness concerns itself with all things evil, dealing with

the most reprehensible subjects ever covered in the DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS game, this book tackles the opposite subject. The

two books share a similar outline, and there are several other

parallels in content as well,

but  their  essential

function  is  quite

different.  The

Book  of  Vile

Darkness gives

Dungeon  Mas-

ters  the  tools

they  need

to

bring  the  villains

and  monsters  of

their campaigns to new

lows  of  depravity  and  evil.

Armed  with  the  Book  of  Exalted

Deeds,  players  can  now  bring  their

characters,  the  heroes  of  the  cam-

paign, to great new heights of valor

and righteousness. In contrast to thor-

oughly  vile  villains,  heroes  are  called

upon to perform truly exalted deeds.

The Book of Exalted Deeds is for players who

arent satisfied by slapping a good alignment

label on their character and then acting no

different from the neutral characters in the

party. This book is all about how to make a

good  alignment  mean  something,  and  how

to live up to the ideals implied in that alignment.

This  is  not  a  book  about  what  good  characters

cant doits not a list of ways to avoid being evil.

Rather, its about what they can do, the power that

they  gain  as  a  direct  result  of  adhering  to  a

higher standard of righteousness than most

of the world can hope to achieve. Its about

being an agent of good, whether a character serves a good deity

or simply adheres to more abstract ideas of goodness. Its about

following  a  higher  call  than  the  lure  of  gold  and  experience

points, wrestling with tougher choices than which monster to

kill first or what magic item to buy with newfound loot, and

doing the kinds of heroic deeds that make a difference in the

game world.

Like  the  Book  of  Vile  Darkness, the  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds is

intended for mature players. Thats not because its filled with

lurid  depictions  of  depravity  and  torture.  The  material  isnt

meant to shock or offend (though some topics may). Rather,

this book deals with tough questions of ethics and morality in

a  serious  manner.  Its  intended  to  help  players  and  Dungeon

Masters wrestle with hard in-game issues: Is it okay to slaugh-

names  drawn

ter every drow I see and sell their goods on the open market?

How  do  I  wrest  information  from  enemy  prisoners  without

compromising  my  alignment?  Is  there  any  hope  for  the  orc

whelps in the stronghold, or should we slaughter them, too?

Many  players  would  just  as  soon  overlook  these  questions,

believing they detract from the fun of the game. Theres nothing

wrong with that. For groups that want to address these issues,

however,  the  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds opens  the  way.  At  the  same

time, it presents a whole host of new opportunities for player

characters  of  good  alignment  and  righteous  conviction:  new

feats,  spells,  prestige  classes,  magic  and  mundane  items,  and

rules to help address the situations they face. These goodies arent

just  for  the  cleric  and  paladin,  eithercharacters  who  some-

times  are  the  sole  voices  of  morality  in  an  adventuring  party.

While paladins and good clerics will certainly find much of

use, characters of all classes can benefit from the new mate-

rial in the Book of Exalted Deedsif they are willing and able

to walk the straight and narrow path of the exalted.

There is one other reason this book is intended

for  mature  audiences:  it  deals  with  certain

aspects  of  real-world  religion  that  might

make  some  people  uncomfortable.

In  the  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds,

youll  find  archons  with

from

Jewish, Christian, and

Gnostic  angelology,

paladins  with  stig-

mata,  and  monks

who  have  sworn

not  to  touch  dead

flesh or drink alco-

hol. Among the holy

relics  discussed  here

are  items  of  torture  and

execution  that  were  used  upon  saints  and  still

carry  the  touch  of  sanctified  blood.  To  many

people, these things are hardly in the same cate-

gory as the appalling abominations found in the

Book of Vile Darkness. To many of us with deeply

held  convictions  about  such  matters,  the

subject  is  touchy  at  best.  This  book

carries  a  warning  because  were

relying  on  you  to  deal  with  your

own reactions to this material in a mature manner: use what you

like,  adapt  what  doesnt  fit,  and  simply  ignore  what  you  dont

like.  Weve  tried  to  present  the  material  with  sensitivity  and

appropriate gravity, and we trust you to use it in the same way.

Authors  Note: I  didnt  expect  this  book  to  require  a  dis-

claimer like the one Monte put in front of the Book of Vile Dark-

ness. I  like  to  think  I  am  a  good  person,  and  I  strongly

encourage others to be good people as well. Nevertheless, I feel

the  need  to  point  out  that  this  book  attempts  to  define  the

morality of goodness in the context of the D&D world, not the

real world. While Ive tried to explore some shades of gray in

this  book,  the  D&D  universe  is  still  much  more  black-and-

white than the real world. I dont advocate anyone killing some-

one they think is evil, to give just one example.

hat is good?

HELPING OTHERS

Many  characters  are  happy  to  rattle  off  long

lists of sins they havent committed as evidence

that  they  are  good. The  utter  avoidance  of  evil,

however, doesnt make a character goodsolidly neutral, per-

haps, but not good.

Being good requires a certain quality of temperament, the

presence of virtues that spur a character, not just to avoid evil

or its appearance, but to actively promote good. As expressed

in the Players Handbook, Good implies altruism, respect for

life,  and  a  concern  for  the  dignity  of  sentient  beings.  Good

characters make personal sacrifices to help others.

Good is not nice, polite, well mannered, prudish, self-right-

eous, or nave, though good-aligned characters might be some

of those things. Good is the awesome holy energy that radiates

from the celestial planes and crushes evil. Good is selfless, just,

hopeful, benevolent, and righteous.

EXALTED DEEDS

These acts of goodness are concrete, positive means by which

the heroes of the world fight against the darkness of evil. They

are the meat and drink of the exalted hero, and should serve as

an inspiration for how to play a character of good alignment,

suggesting not only common actions but also motivations and

personality traits.

When a village elder comes to a good character and says,

Please help us, a dragon is threatening our village, the

good  characters  response  is  not,  What  can  you  pay?

Neutral  characters  might  be  that  mercenary,  and  evil

characters would certainly consider how to collect the

most benefit from the situation. For a good character,

however, helping others is a higher priority than per-

sonal gain.

A good character might ask a number of other ques-

tions before leaping up from her seat and charging to

the  villages  aid:  good  characters  arent  necessarily

stupid. A good character can be cautious, determin-

ing how powerful the dragon is and whether addi-

tional reinforcements are required, but she should

never  say,  Sorry,  Im  out  of  my  league.  Go  find

another hero. Its just good sense to learn as much

as possible about a foe before plunging into battle.

Even more, a good character need not be navely

trusting. Some might go to great lengths to verify

that the elders story is true and not some villains

attempt to lure them into a trap.

All her caution or suspicion still doesnt under-

mine a good characters responsibility to offer help to

those  in  need.  Altruism  is  the  first  word  in  the

Players Handbooks definition of good, and helping

others without reward or even thanks is part of a good charac-

ters daily work.

So  who  are  these  others  a  good  character  is  supposed  to

help? Again, the good is not necessarily stupid rule comes into

play. Obviously, a good character is not required by her align-

ment to help evil characters or those who are working at cross-

purposes  to  a  good  characters  own  goals.  However,  altruism

often  blends  into  mercy  in  situations  where  a  villain  asks  for

quarter and aid (see Mercy below). In any case, altruism is tem-

pered by respect for life and concern for the dignity of sentient

beings, and good characters balance their desire to help others

with their desire to promote goodness and life.

CHARITY

One specific aspect of helping others is charity: providing material

assistance to those in need, particularly those whose situation in

life robs them of pride and respect. Offering food to the hungry,

clothes to the naked, lodging to the homeless, care for orphans

and widows, and hope to the hopeless are among the simplest and

yet most profound of good deeds. Good characters offer this sort of

assistance to needy people without regard for their moral charac-

ter and with the utmost concern for their dignity.

The idea that creatures too weak to better themselves deserve

their low position is a hallmark of evil dogma. Good characters

reject this notion completely, recognizing that most poor and

needy people are the victims of circumstance, not of their own

weakness or failings.

HEALING

Healing wounds, removing disease, and neutralizing poison are

a  concrete  embodiment  of  a  good  characters  respect  for  life.

These  deeds  are  not  inherently  good,  since  they  can  be  per-

formed selfishly or in the interests of evil. Even so, healing magic

involves positive energy, which is closely linked to holy power.

Many  good  characters  devote  their  lives  to  healing  as  an

expression of their morality. Pelor is a god of healing, and his

clerics with the Healing domain make it their mission to share

Pelors beneficence with others through healing. Even paladins,

whose mission is primarily to smite evildoers, have the innate

ability to heal wounds and remove disease as a reflection of their

pure goodness. A character devoted to healing views the power

to heal as a gift of celestial powers and is generally careful never

to use that gift in a way that would cheapen or taint itby heal-

ing evil characters, for example. On the other hand, some view

healing  as  a  means  of  grace,  believing  that  every  cure  light

wounds cast  on  a  blackguard  cannot  help  but  lead  the  villain

closer to repentance and redemption.

PERSONAL SACRIFICE

A good character doesnt just help others or fight evil when its

convenient for him to do so. Even the most generous altruism,

when it comes without sacrifice or even serves ones own self-

interest, is neutral at best. A character committed to the cause of

good champions that cause in any circumstance, often at great

personal risk or cost.

Forfeiting any claim on a reward for ones deeds is a simple

form of sacrifice touched upon in the previous section. Volun-

tarily donating money, goods, or even magic items to a temple,

charitable  institution  (an  orphanage  or  aid  society),  or  other

organization  is  another  financial  sacrifice  often  practiced  by

good characters. Exceptionally virtuous characters might swear

sacred vows, forever sacrificing the enjoyment of some worldly

pleasurealcohol or stimulants, sex, or material possessions

or  course  of  action,  including  violence. True  heroes  of  right-

eousness, all too often, sacrifice their own lives to save the lives

of others.

WORSHIPING GOOD DEITIES

The deities of good are the highest exemplars of the principles

of virtue, righteousness, and purity. By offering them worship,

sacrifice, and service, good characters cultivate their own per-

sonal virtue, assist the cause of good in concrete ways (support-

ing  the  charitable  work  of  the  church  and  strengthening  the

clerics and paladins who serve as the deitys agents), and extend

the deitys reach in the world.

Not  all  good  characters  worship  good  deities.  Some  serve

neutral  deities  like  St.  Cuthbert,  Obad-Hai,  or  Olidammara,

while  others  put  the  claims  of  good  above  the  dogma  of  any

deity. Nevertheless, virtually all good characters are willing to

cooperate with the churches of good deities, recognizing them

as allies with a common cause.

Unlike  evil  deities,  good  deities  usually  have  temples  and

shrines in open, public placesoften at or near the center of

bustling cities. In fact, the worship of good deities is one of the

forces  that  often  helps  to  cement  humanoid  communities

together,  serving  to  unite  the  populace  in  a  common  activity

and a common set of ideals. This is particularly common among

nonhuman  races  of  good  alignment,  including  halflings,

EXALTED DEEDS AND VILE DARKNESS

Your gaming group will make the best use of this book if your

DM,  at  least,  also  has  a  copy  of  the  Book  of  Vile  Darkness.

Nothing in here requires you to have another book, but a party

of  exalted  player  characters  shines  brightest  when  pitted

against truly vile villains. Some of the spells, feats, items, and

other offerings in this book are specifically designed to coun-

teract similar bits of vileness. The spell ease pain was written

specifically with angry ache in mind, for example. However, they

all have broad enough application that you can use them even

without another book (since, in the case of ease pain, a number

of other spells and effects create pain).

The Book of Vile Darkness includes an appendix concerning

evil  player  characters.  If  you  are  part  of  a  campaign  with  evil

player characters (PCs), then the function of this book might

shift  somewhat.  In  that  case,  the  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds

becomes a source of opponents and enemiesgood creatures

to  fight  and  good  spells  for  those  good  nonplayer  characters

(NPCs) to cast against your characters. Thats a perfectly fine

use of this book.

On  the  other  hand,  if  all  the  new  tricksspells,  feats,

prestige  classesin  Book  of  Vile  Darkness tempted  you  to

explore  evil  characters,  then  have  a  look  at  the  material  in

Book of Exalted Deeds. Maybe youll be inspired to return to the

side of good!

dwarves,  and  elves,  where  good  alignment  is  the  norm  and  a

single deity often claims the allegiance of an entire community.

However,  it  is  common  for  even  human  cities  to  be  drawn

together  in  the  worship  of  Pelor,  who  commands  at  least  the

respect of neutral citizens as well as good. Of course, in evil cul-

tures, the worship of good deities can be both a crime and an act

of rebellion.

CASTING GOOD SPELLS

Good  spells  alleviate  suffering,  inspire  hope  or  joy,  use  the

casters energy or vitality to help or heal another, summon celes-

tials,  or  channel  holy  power.  Particularly  in  the  last  instance,

good spells might be just as destructiveat least to evil crea-

turesas a fireball. Not all good spells involve only sweetness

and light.

Good  spells  dont  have  any  redemptive  influence  on  those

who cast them, for better or worse. An evil wizard who dabbles

in  a  few  good  spells,  most  likely  to  help  him  achieve  selfish

ends, does not usually decide to abandon his evil ways because

hes been purified by the touch of the holy. On the other hand,

there are certain spells whose sanctified nature demands a con-

crete, physical sacrifice from the caster (see Sanctified Magic

in  Chapter  6).  No  character  can  draw  upon  such  holy  magic

without being changed for the better

as a result.

MERCY

For good characters who devote their lives to hunting and exter-

minating the forces of evil, evils most seductive lure may be the

abandonment of mercy. Mercy means giving quarter to enemies

who surrender and treating criminals and prisoners with com-

passion and even kindness. It is, in effect, the good doctrine of

respect  for  life  taken  to  its  logical  extremerespecting  and

honoring even the life of ones enemy. In a world full of enemies

who  show  no  respect  for  life  whatsoever,  it  can  be  extremely

tempting  to  treat  foes  as  they  have  treated  others,  to  exact

revenge for slain comrades and innocents, to offer no quarter

and become merciless.

A good character must not succumb to that trap. Good char-

acters  must  offer  mercy  and  accept  surrender  no  matter  how

many times villains might betray that kindness or escape from

captivity to continue their evil deeds. If a foe surrenders, a good

character is bound to accept the surrender, bind the prisoner,

and treat him as kindly as possible. (See Mercy, Prisoners, and

Redemption in Chapter 2 for more about the proper treatment

of prisoners.)

In general, its a good idea for the DM to make sure that the

players  arent  punished  unnecessarily  for  showing  mercy  to

opponents. If every prisoner schemes to betray the party and

later  escapes  from  prison,  the  players  quickly  come  to  realize

that showing mercy simply isnt worth it. Its fine for these frus-

A paladin must choose between destroying evil and

honoring love.

trations to arise once in a while, but if they happen every time,

the players will rightly give up in frustration.

FORGIVENESS

Closely tied to mercy, forgiveness is still a separate act. Mercy

means respecting the life of an enemy, treating him like a being

worthy of kindness. Forgiveness is an act of faith, a willingness

to  believe  that  even  the  vilest  evildoer  is  capable  of  change.

Good characters are not enjoined to forgive and forget every

time someone harms them. At the simplest level, forgiveness

means abdicating ones right to vengeance. On a deeper level, if

an evil character makes an effort to repent, turn away from evil,

and lead a better life, a good character is called upon to encour-

age the reformed villain, let the past be past, and not to hold the

characters evil deeds against her.

Forgiveness  is  essential  to  redemption.  If  those  she  has

harmed refuse to forgive her, a character seeking to turn away

from evil faces nothing but hatred and resentment from those

who  should  be  her  new  allies.  Isolated  from  both  her  former

allies  and  her  former  enemies,  she  nurses  resentment  and

quickly slides back into her evil ways. By extending forgiveness

to those who ask it, good characters actively spread good, both

by encouraging those who are trying to turn away from evil and

by  demonstrating  to  evildoers  that  the  path  of  redemption  is

possible.

BRINGING HOPE

If the most soullessly evil villains relish spreading despair and

devouring every last shred of hope, it naturally follows that the

cause of good involves rekindling hope in the face of despair.

This  might  be  the  most  nebulous  of  all  good  deeds,  hard  to

define or measure, but it also might be the heart and essence of

good. All the other good deeds discussed in this section, in addi-

tion to their often concrete and physical benefits to people in

need, have the additional intangible benefit of increasing hope.

A man whose body is wasting away from disease actually has

two illnesses: the physical disease that consumes his flesh and

the despair that gnaws at his soul. Healing him not only heals

his  body,  it  also  restores  his  lost  hope.  A  woman  who  throws

herself on a paladins mercy and turns from her evil ways strug-

gles along the difficult road to redemption. The paladins mercy

and forgiveness offer the most important assistance along that

road: hope, a vision of the reward that lies ahead.

Hope  in  its  truest  form  is  more  than  just  a  vague  wish  for

things to be better than they are; it is a taste of things as they

might  be.  When  an  exalted  bard  comes  to  a  city  that  groans

under the oppressive rule of a pit fiend, he may inspire hope by

singing  tales  of  liberation  or  by  demonstrating  force  of  arms

against the pit fiends diabolic minions. But the best hope avail-

able  to  the  oppressed  residents  of  the  city  is  when  the  bard

simply shows them kindness, thereby reminding them of what

it  was  like  to  live  under  a  more  benign  rule.  He  brings  them

together in community, whereas the devils have been turning

them against each other, sowing distrust alongside despair. By

experiencing a taste of kindness and freedom, however small,

the citizens are inspired with hope. That hope empowers them

to  resist  the  devils,  with  or  without  the  bards  force  of  arms.

REDEEMING EVIL

Perhaps the greatest act of good one could ever hope to accom-

plish is the redemption of an evil soul. Bringing an evil charac-

ter to see the error of her ways not only stops her from preying

on innocent victims, but helps her as well, winning her a place

in the blessed afterlife of the Upper Planes instead of an eternity

of torment and damnation in the Lower. While acts of charity

and healing might help a persons body, redeeming an evil char-

acter helps her soul.

Holding a sword to a captured villains throat and shouting,

Worship  Heironeous  or  die!  is  not  a  means  of  redemption.

Sword-point conversion might be a useful political tool, but it is

almost entirely without impact on the souls of the converts.

Worse,  it  stinks  of  evil,  robbing  the  victim  of  the  freedom  to

choose  and  echoing  the  use  of  torture  to  extract  the  desired

behavior.  True  redemption  is  a  much  more  difficult  and

involved  process,  but  truly  virtuous  characters  consider  the

reward worth the effort involved. The process of redemption is

described in Chapter 2: Variant Rules.

Of course, good characters recognize that some creatures are

utterly  beyond  redemption.  Most  creatures  described  in  the

Monster  Manual as  always  evil  are  either  completely  irre-

deemable  or  so  intimately  tied  to  evil  that  they  are  almost

entirely hopeless. Certainly demons and devils are best slain, or

at  least  banished,  and  only  a  nave  fool  would  try  to  convert

them. Evil dragons might not be entirely beyond salvation, but

there is truly only the barest glimmer of hope.

On  the  other  hand,  a  good  character  approaches  every

encounter with orcs, goblinoids, and even the thoroughly evil

drow  with  heart  and  mind  open  to  the  possibility,  however

remote, that his opponents might some day be transformed into

allies. Creatures that are usually evil can be redeemed. This is

not  to  say  that  a  good  characters  first  thought  in  an  ambush

should be, How can I redeem these poor orcs? However, if the

ambushing orcs end up surrendering, there is ample opportu-

nity to seek their redemption.

EXALTED VERSUS EPIC

The words epic and exalted are similar in meaning as well

as  reminiscent  of  each  other  in  sound.  In  the  context  of  the

D&D game, however, their meanings are completely unrelated

to  each  other.  Epic  characters  are  those  who  have  exceeded

20th  level,  entering  territory  beyond  that  explored  in  the

Players Handbook. Exalted characters are simply those, of any

pqqqqrs

level, who are devoted to the highest ideals of good (whether

lawful,  neutral,  or  chaotic  in  bent).  Exalted  characters  may

become epic, like any other character. Exalted deeds may often

have an epic scope, without necessarily involving characters of

epic level. The terms are distinct, and its important to remem-

ber that the material in this book is applicable to characters of

any level and their adventures.

THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW

The choice to follow the path of exalted deeds means picking

ones way among complicated moral issues and painful dilem-

mas. It means questioning some of the common assumptions

about  whats  acceptable  in  the  context  of  a  D&D  adventure.

While the previous section outlined positive actions good char-

acters  can  (and  should)  perform  to  improve  the  world  and

better the lot of those in it, this section discusses some of the dif-

ficult choices and decisions that characters trying to live up to

high  ideals  are  likely  to  face  when  those  ideals  make  contact

with reality.

ENDS AND MEANS

When  do  good  ends  justify  evil  means  to  achieve  them?  Is  it

morally  acceptable,  for  example,  to  torture  an  evil  captive  in

order to extract vital information that can prevent the deaths of

thousands  of  innocents?  Any  good  character  shudders  at  the

thought of committing torture, but the goal of preventing thou-

sands of deaths is undeniably a virtuous one, and a neutral char-

acter  might  easily  consider  the  use  of  torture  in  such  a

circumstance.  With  evil  acts  on  a  smaller

scale, even the most virtuous characters

can find themselves tempted to agree

that  a  very  good  end  justifies  a

mildly evil means. Is it acceptable to

tell a small lie in order to prevent a

minor catastrophe? A large catastro-

phe?  A  world-shattering  catastrophe?

In the D&D universe, the fundamen-

tal answer is no, an evil act is an evil act

no  matter  what  good  result  it  may

achieve.  A  paladin  who  knowingly

commits an evil act in pursuit of any

end  no  matter  how  good  still  jeopard-

izes  her  paladinhood.  Any  exalted

character  risks  losing  exalted  feats  or

other benefits of celestial favor if he com-

mits any act of evil for any reason. Whether

or  not  good  ends  can  justify  evil  means,  they  certainly

cannot make evil means any less evil.

Some good characters might view a situation where an evil

act is required to avert a catastrophic evil as a form of martyr-

dom:  I  can  save  a  thousand  innocent  lives  by  sacrificing  my

purity. For some, that is a sacrifice worth making, just as they

would  not  hesitate  to  sacrifice  their  lives  for  the  same  cause.

After all, it would simply be selfish to let innocents die so a char-

acter can hang on to her exalted feats.

Unfortunately, this view is ultimately misguided. This line of

thinking treats the purity of the good characters soul as a com-

modity (like her exalted feats) that she can just give up or sacri-

fice like any other possession. In fact, when an otherwise good

character  decides  to  commit  an  evil  act,  the  effects  are  larger

than the individual character. What the character sees as a per-

sonal  sacrifice  is  actually  a  shift  in  the  universal  balance  of

power between good and evil, in evils favor. The consequences

of that single evil act, no matter how small, extend far beyond

the single act and involve a loss to more than just the character

doing the deed. Thus, it is not a personal sacrifice, but a conces-

sion to evil, and thus unconscionable.

Good ends might sometimes demand evil means. The means

remain evil, however, and so characters who are serious about

their good alignment and exalted status cannot resort to them,

no matter how great the need.

Sometimes a situation might demand that a good character

cooperate with an evil one in order to accomplish a worthy and

righteous goal. The evil character might not even be pursuing

the same goal. For example, a brief civil war has put a new ruling

house in power in a drow city, and the new rulers start actively

raiding the surface world. A party of good adventurers travels

into the depths of the earth to stop the drow raids. At the same

time, a party of evil drow loyal to the deposed house seeks to

overthrow the new rulers and restore their house to its position

of power. The two groups have different but mutually compati-

ble goals, and it is possiblewithin certain limitsfor them to

cooperate with each other. However, the good characters must

not tolerate any evil acts committed by an evil ally during the

time of their alliance, and cant simply turn a blind eye to such

acts. They must ensure that helping the drow will put a stop to

the surface raids, which might entail a level of trust the drow

simply do not deserve. And of course they must not

turn on their erstwhile allies when victory is in

sight, betraying the trust the drow placed

in them. Such a situation is dangerous

both  physically  and  morally,  but

cooperating with evil creatures is

not necessarily evil in itself.

VIOLENCE

Violence  is  a  part  of  the  D&D

world, and not inherently evil in the

context of that world. The deities of

good equip their heroes not just to be

meek and humble servants, but to be

their  fists  and  swords,  their  champi-

ons in a brutal war against the forces of

evil. A paladin smiting a blackguard or a

blue  dragon  is  not  committing  an  evil  act:

the cause of good expects and often demands that violence

be brought to bear against its enemies.

That  said,  there  are  certain  limits  upon  the  use  of  violence

that good characters must observe. First, violence in the name

of good must have just cause, which in the D&D world means

primarily that it must be directed against evil. It is certainly pos-

sible for a good nation to declare war upon another good nation,

but fighting in such a conflict is not a good act. In fact, even

launching a war upon a nearby tribe of evil orcs is not necessar-

ily  good  if  the  attack  comes  without  provocationthe  mere

existence of evil orcs is not a just cause for war against them, if

the orcs have been causing no harm. A full-scale war would pro-

voke the orcs to evil deeds and bring unnecessary suffering to

both sides of the conflict. Similarly, revenge is not an acceptable

cause for violence, although violence is an appropriate means of

stopping  further  acts  of  evil  (as  opposed  to  paying  back  evil

already committed).

The second consideration is that violence should have good

intentions.  Launching  an  incursion  into  orc  territory  is  not  a

good act if the primary motivation is profit, whether that means

clearing the treasure out of the ruins the orcs inhabit or claim-

ing their land for its natural resources. Violence against evil is

acceptable when it is directed at stopping or preventing evil acts

from being done.

The  third  consideration  is  one  of  discrimination.  Violence

cannot be considered good when it is directed against noncom-

batants  (including  children  and  the  females  of  at  least  some

races and cultures). Placing a fireball so that its area includes orc

women and children as well as warriors and barbarians is evil,

since the noncombatant orcs are not a threat and are compara-

tively defenseless.

Finally, the means of violence must be as good as the inten-

tions behind it. The use of evil spells, obviously, is not good even

when  the  target  is  evil.  Likewise,  the  use  of  torture  or  other

practices  that  inflict  undue  suffering  upon  the  victims  goes

beyond the pale of what can be considered good.

Within  these  limits,  violence  in  the  name  of  good  is  an

acceptable practice in the D&D universe.

RELATIONSHIPS

Implicit in D&Ds definition of goodaltruism, respect for life,

and  making  sacrifices  for  the  sake  of  othersis  a  sense  that

good is about maintaining a certain quality of relationship with

others.  A  good  characters  relationships  with  other  characters

should be built on a mutual respect for one another, whether

that relationship involves the companionship of an adventuring

party or the intimacy of a marriage.

There is nothing inherently evil about human (or humanoid)

sexuality, and being a good character doesnt necessarily mean

remaining a virgin. Certain religions and cultures in the D&D

universe  encourage  or  at  least  condone  some  people  taking

vows of chastity, but these are similar to vows of poverty or absti-

nencerooted in the belief that giving up the enjoyment of a

good and natural thing can have positive spiritual benefits, not

derived from an attitude that sex is evil. However, a good char-

acter is bound to realize that sexuality is laden with traditions of

exploitation  and  abuse,  an  area  of  interpersonal  relationships

where power dynamics are often manifested in unfortunate

really,  evilways.  A  good  character  is  not  opposed  to  sex  in

principle,  but  will  not  condone  exploitative  or  coercive  rela-

tionships such as prostitution, the use of slaves for sex, or sexual

contact  with  children  or  others  without  the  power  to  enter

freely and willingly into a relationship of mutual respect.

Also  within  the  context  of  respectful  relationships,  good

characters exercise caution in the use of compulsion magic to

force others behavior. Spells such as dominate person, geas, and

suggestion allow a caster to control another person, robbing that

person of free will. This may not be an inherently evil act, but it

certainly  carries  a  tremendous  ethical  responsibility.  Forcing

anyone to commit an evil act, of course, is evil. Furthermore, a

creature under compulsion should be treated the same as a help-

less prisoner, since that creature no longer poses a threat, at least

for the duration of the spell. Once an enemy is dominated, for

example, he should not be killed, but shown mercy and treated

the  same  as  a  prisoner  who  had  willingly  surrendered.  (The

same holds true for charmed and compelled creatures.)

Perhaps the most important area of relationships for player

characters  involves  a  characters  interactions  with  the  other

members  of  the  party.  A  good  character  respects  the  other

characters, treats them fairly, and values their lives as highly as

his own. That said, he is within his rights to expect the same

treatment  from  them.  Neutral  characters  are  often  joined  to

adventuring parties through bonds of friendship and loyalty

to  the  other  characters,  and  a  good  character  respects  those

bonds and can trust a friend, even one who is not also good.

Evil characters, however, typically join adventuring parties for

purely selfish reasons. Paladins, of course, are prohibited from

associating with evil characters, but other exalted PCs should

also steer clear of evil companions, unless the evil character

is  attempting to reform herself and making progress toward

neutrality at least.

Good characters in parties that also include neutral charac-

ters carry a weighty burden of responsibility. They should serve

as examples of the good life, demonstrating the virtue and the

rewards of following the righteous path. They must steer their

neutral companions away from evil deeds, and ought to encour-

age them toward goodness, as gently or as bluntly as the indi-

vidual  case  requires.  Good  characters  can  be  guilty  by

association with neutral characters who commit evil deeds, and

simply turning a blind eye to the questionable acts of their com-

panions is not an acceptable option.

This important prohibition can cause a great deal of friction

within an adventuring party. Some players build their charac-

ters  on  the  idea  of  being  roguish,  unsavory,  perhaps  a  little

brutal. If the paladin in the party is constantly getting in the way

of that characters approach to things, everyones enjoyment of

the game is at risk. Many of these problems can be eliminated at

the outset by working to achieve a consensus among the players

regarding what kind of game you are going to play. That doesnt

mean that everyone needs to agree to play good characters and

stick to the straight and narrow, but players who want to play

neutral characters need to know up front what theyre getting

into, and the whole group needs to decide to what extent ethical

debate is going to be a part of every game session. If everyones

happy with the paladin and the rogue constantly being at cross-

purposes, and the group decides to make that a central part of

the roleplaying experience, thats fineas long as the players

treat each other with respect and the characters dont split the

party into two warring factions.

DIVIDED LOYALTIES

For better or for worse, a paladin is not just good: she is lawful

good, sworn not just to uphold the principles of good but also

bound  by  a  code  of  conduct,  and  subject  to  local  law  as  well.

Many paladins are also members of a specific deitys church, a

knightly order of some sort, or both. At the best of times, these

various loyaltiesher code of conduct, her churchs laws, her

orders demands, the laws of her nation, and the abstraction of

her alignmentare all in harmony, and her path is clear before

her. When circumstances are not so ideal, she finds herself torn

between  conflicting  demands:  her  superior  in  her  knightly

order commands her to kill a brutal murderer who has escaped

punishment in court on a legal technicality, for example. Her

personal code requires that she punish those that harm inno-

cents, and this killer certainly falls in that category. However,

her personal code also instructs her to respect legitimate author-

ity, which includes both her knightly superior and the local law

that has let the killer go free. The demands of her good align-

ment  suggest  she  should  punish  the  wrongdoer,  but  the

demands of her lawful alignment insist that she obey the judg-

ment of the court. It is entirely possible that either her superior

or  the  magistrate  in  the  case  is  corrupt  or  even  possessed.

Whom does she obey? How does she sort out the conflicting

demands of her loyalties?

Paladins are by no means alone in this situation. Any charac-

ter who tries consistently to do good eventually finds himself

in a situation where different loyalties are in conflict. Chaotic

good characters might care far less about a potentially corrupt

or at least ineffectual court system, but they might have other

personal standards or obligations that cause conflict in similar

or  different  situations.  In  the  end,  however,  many  such  con-

flicts boil down to a question of priorities, and for a character

who aspires to exalted deeds, good is the highest priority. In the

example above, the murderer must at least be captured, if not

killed, before he can kill again. If she has reason to suspect cor-

ruption,  either  in  the  court  or  in  her  own  order,  the  paladin

must attempt to uncover it, though it might mean being cast

out of her order, punished under local law, or both. Her palad-

inhood and her exalted status remain intact, since she acted in

the  cause  of  good  even  when  that  required  questioning  the

legitimacy of authority. Magistrates or knightly superiors who

serve the cause of evil while posing as agents of good are not

legitimate authority, and the paladin is right for exposing their

corruption.

What does a good character do when he is opposed by good?

Two good nations might go to war, two good adventuring par-

ties might be working toward opposite goals, or two good char-

acters  might  become  bitter  enemies.  As  discussed  under

Violence,  above,  violence  against  good  creatures  is  not  good.

When conflict arises, as it certainly will at times, good charac-

ters must use every diplomatic means available to avoid the out-

break of violence, whether between nations, smaller groups, or

individuals. In the D&D universe, if one sides goals are actually

evil, a relatively simple commune spell can make that abundantly

clear.  Diplomacy  might  not  always  work,  but  the  outbreak  of

violence is not just a failure of diplomacy, it is a failure of good

and a victory for evil.

CRIME AND PUNISHMENT

When  dealing  with  evildoers  who  are  citizens  of  the  realm

specifically, or members of the civilized humanoid races (dwarf,

elf, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, halfling, human) in general, it is

often preferable to bring evildoers to justice in the form of legit-

imate legal authority rather than meting out that justice oneself.

When fighting through a dungeon, characters neednt switch to

subdual tactics when they suddenly encounter evil dwarf min-

ions. But if those minions surrender, it is best to take the pris-

oners  back  to  town  to  stand  trial  for  their  crimes.  When  the

adventure takes place in a city and the opponents are citizens of

the city (rather than evil monsters from the sewers or deeper

underground), subduing opponents and turning them over to

the city watch is preferable to killing them and possibly being

forced to stand trial for murder.

The  principles  of  good  make  certain  demands  about  how

criminals  are  treated. The  death  penalty  for  serious  crimes  is

commonly practiced and widely accepted and does not qualify

as evil, even if many good characters, firm in their belief that

redemption is always possible, would rather see even the vilest

criminals  offered  the  opportunity  to  find  their  way  to  right-

eousness  during  their  imprisonment.  Torturing  prisoners,

either to extract information or simply as a means of punish-

ment, is unequivocally evil, however.

This leads good characters (especially lawful good characters)

into a dilemma: Is it wrong to turn a prisoner over to legitimate

authorities  knowing  that  the  prisoner  will  be  tortured  and

abused in captivity? Fortunately, the answer is straightforward,

if  sometimes  difficult  to  implement.  Yes,  delivering  a  person

over to be tortured, even if the person is thoroughly evil and the

torturers are a legitimate authority, is evil. How to avoid being

put in that position is a more difficult question, and one that

depends greatly on the circumstances.

BEING AHEAD OF YOUR TIME

Heroic characters often end up at odds with their culture and

society.  The  standards  expected  of  good  characters  in  D&D,

especially those who lay claim to exalted status, bear much more

similarity  to  modern  sensibilities  about  justice,  equality,  and

respect for life than to the actual medieval world that D&D is

loosely based on, and that is quite intentional. It is certainly pos-

sible that your campaign world might be a more enlightened

place than medieval Europea place where men and women

are considered equal, slavery is not practiced in any form, tor-

ture  and  capital  punishment  are  shunned,  and  the  various

human and humanoid races live together in harmony. In such a

case, an exalted character can live in relative peace with her cul-

ture, and focus her attention on slaying evil creatures in ruins

and dungeons or rival, evil nations.

On the other hand, your campaign world might more closely

reflect the realities of life in Earths Dark or Middle Ages. Per-

haps  women  are  not  viewed  as  mens  equals  or  even  sentient

beings in their own right, slavery is widespread, testimony from

serfs  is  only  acceptable  if  extracted  through  torture,  and

humans  of  a  certain  skin  tone  (let  alone  nonhumans)  are

viewed as demonic creatures. It is vitally important to remem-

ber one thing: these factors dont change anything else said in

this chapter (or in the Book of Vile Darkness) about what consti-

tutes a good or evil deed. Even if slavery, torture, or discrimina-

tion  are  condoned  by  society,  they  remain  evil.  That  simply

means  that  an  exalted  character  has  an  even  harder  road  to

follow. Not only must she worry about external evils like con-

jured demons and rampaging orc hordes, she must also contend

with the evil within her own society.

In  all  likelihood,  most  human  (and  halfling)  societies  fall

somewhere  between  the  two  extremes  described  above.  In

game terms, humans tend to be neutral, neither good nor evil.

Human societies might tolerate a variety of evil practices, even

if some humans find them distasteful. In such a circumstance,

an exalted character is still at odds with the norms of her society

and may occasionally find herself in conflict with it, but she can

devote her time and attention to dealing with evil acts, either

inside  or  outside  her  society,  rather  than  trying  to  reform  an

entire nation or culture.

In situations where a societys practices put good characters at

odds with it, a good characters alignment is the strongest indi-

cator of how she will deal with that conflict.

LAW, CHAOS, AND GOOD

Lawful good characters by no means have a monopoly on good-

ness. Though all paladins are lawful good, plenty of exalted char-

acters of all character classes are chaotic good or neutral good,

and they exemplify the ideals of good in the D&D universe no

less  than  the  paladin.  There  are  differences  between  the

goodness  of  a  lawful  good  character  and  that  of  his

chaotic good counterpart, just as there are marked dif-

ferences  between  the  archons  and  eladrins  that

embody  those  alignments  in  the  celestial  realms.

Lawful  Good characters  possess  a  sense  of  disci-

pline, honor, and community that other good charac-

ters do not necessarily share. Lawful good characters

are  members  of  monastic  or  knightly  orders,

church hierarchies, or organizations devoted

to  righteous  causes.  They  believe  that

morality  can  be  legislated,  and  promote

the establishment of just societies whose

laws and customs inculcate good behav-

ior in their citizens. Lawful good adventur-

ers  fight  evil  knowing  that  they  have  the

support  of  legal  systems  behind  them:  they

are  bringing  criminals  to  justice  as  well  as

opposing evil.

I

In  an  evil  culture  or  one  that

tolerates  evil,  lawful  good

characters are in a difficult

situation. On the one hand,

they abhor evil and cannot stand to

see  it  institutionalized.  On  the  other

hand, they believe in legitimate author-

ity  and  will  not  overthrow  a  kingdom

because of evil practices within it. Lawful

good characters usually try to work to

change flawed social structures from

within,  using  whatever  political

power  is  available  to  them  rather

than toppling those structures

by force.

The righteous crusader fights evil

and aids the oppressed.

Chaotic Good char-

acters  are  strong-willed

individualists who tolerate

no oppression, even in the

name of the common good.

They usually work alone or

in loose bands, rather than as part of some organization or hier-

archy. They have no confidence in the ability of laws and social

mores to train people in good behavior. Indeed, they have seen

all too often how people hide behind rules and laws as an excuse

for evil or at least irresponsible acts. While promoting a legal

system  that  places  few  restrictions  on  individual  freedom,

chaotic good individuals look to other forcesreligion, philos-

ophy, or community, for exampleto encourage good behavior

and punish evil. Chaotic good adventurers fight evil because its

evil, not because its illegal.

In societies where evil practices are tolerated, chaotic good

characters are the most likely rebels, and they have few hesita-

tions about overthrowing the existing order if it means elimi-

nating those evils.

12

Neutral  Good characters  occupy  an  indistinct  middle

ground. They espouse the ideals of good and none other. As a

rule, they dont care whether good is imposed through laws and

customs  or  encouraged  by  temples  and  philosophers;  they

simply  want  goodness  to  flourish.  Legislating  morality  some-

times  works,  and  is  good  as  far  as  it  goes.  When  lawful

good societies begin legislating every detail of their citi-

zens lives, however, passing laws on subjects that have

no  bearing  on  good  and  evil,  the  neutral  good  citizens

become  impatient.  They  support  law  when  it  promotes

good, but not law for its own sake. Similarly, they like the idea of

personal freedom, but theyre not sure everyone should have it:

too much freedom gives evildoers too much room to prosper.

Like  chaotic  good  adventurers,  neutral  good  ones  fight  evil

because its evil, but it certainly doesnt hurt to have the backing

of legal authority whenever possible.

Neutral  good  characters  in  societies  that  tolerate  evil  resist

evil to the extent they can, without actively working to over-

throw the government. They protest injustice, sometimes

engaging in civil disobedience since unjust laws are use-

less and not binding in their view.

PLAYING A HERO

The preceding discussions of good deeds

and careful balancing acts are most

useful  when  put  into  context

with  the  overall  personality  and

career  of  a  hero.  The  following

examples  detail  an  assortment  of

heroic archetypes that exemplify vari-

ous aspects of virtue, morality, and good.

They  can  be  used  to  provide  ideas  for

NPCs to serve as allies or companions of

the  player  characters,  as  plot  hooks  or

patrons, or as the focus of an adventure. In

addition, they can serve as inspiration for players to

use in shaping the background and personalities of

their  own  exalted  characters.  (However,  players

should remember that these characters have

gear  appropriate  for  their  level  assuming

that they are NPCs. Used as player characters,

theywith  the  exception  of  Veshannshould

have more gear.)

THE RIGHTEOUS CRUSADER

The righteous crusader is dedicated to fighting evil: slaying evil

monsters, rooting out corrupt officials, or changing deplorable

traditions and practices. He might be a paladin in plate armor

leading the charge on the fields of war, or an aristocrat draped

in finery speaking out against injustice in the halls of politics.

In  any  case,  he  is  proud,  confident  (often  bordering  on  arro-

gant), forceful, and pure.

As  an  adventurer,  the  righteous  crusader  is  a  quixotic

figurea knight on a quest to rid the world of evil. He smites

evil  monsters,  deposes  evil  tyrants,  banishes  evil  demons,

and hallows evil temples. He is a righter of wrongs, a cham-

pion of the downtrodden, and a heroic figure in every sense

of the word.

Sample Righteous Crusader

As a young man, Ulmo was caught picking the wrong pocket

and imprisoned until such time as he makes peace with the

law. After a jailhouse conversion to the faith of Heironeous,

he petitioned for release to take part in a crusade to reclaim a

holy land from evil forces. A friendly paladin agreed to watch

over Ulmo, instruct him in the faith, and keep him from stray-

ing too far, and together they joined a band of adventurers in

the crusade. Ulmo followed his gods dictates but never felt the

same deep calling of his comrades until, in a moment of des-

peration,  he  tried  to  mimic  the  righteousness  of  a  cleric  in

order to cast raise dead from a scroll. As the holy power flowed

from Heironeous through him to raise his friend, he felt his

soul lifted up from its doubts and he immediately dedicated

his life to following his gods will. Better suited to contempla-

tion  than  preaching,  he  abandoned  his  leather  armor  for  a

monks robe. He now spends his time meditating and striking

down  the  enemies  of  Heironeous  with  precision,  discipline,

and certainty.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): Ulmo may use a full attack action to

make one extra attack per round with an unarmed strike or a

special monk weapon at his highest base attack bonus, but this

attack  and  each  other  attack  made  in  that  round  take  a  1

penalty  apiece. This  penalty  applies  for  1  round,  so  it  affects

attacks  of  opportunity  Ulmo  might  make  before  his  next

action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham, Ulmo

can make the extra attack either with that weapon or unarmed.

If armed with two such weapons, he uses one for his regular

attack(s)  and  the  other  for  the  extra  attack.  In  any  case,  his

damage bonus on the attack with his off hand is not reduced.

Ki Strike (Su): Ulmos unarmed strike can deal damage to a

creature with damage reduction as if the blow were made with

a magic weapon.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If Ulmo can catch an opponent when she

is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can

strike a vital spot for an extra 5d6 points of damage. For com-

plete details on the sneak attack ability, see the description of

the slayer of Domiel in Chapter 5: Prestige Classes.

Evasion (Ex): If Ulmo is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, he

takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Halfling Traits (Ex): +2 morale bonus on saves against fear;

+1 bonus on attack rolls with thrown weapons and slings.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Ulmo cannot be flanked

except by a rogue of at least 14th level.

Opportunist  (Ex): Once  per  round,  Ulmo  can  make  an

attack  of  opportunity  against  an  opponent  who  has  just  been

struck  for  damage  in  melee  by  another  character. This  attack

counts as his attack of opportunity for that round.

Purity  of  Body  (Ex): Ulmo  has  immunity  to  all  diseases

except  for  magical  diseases  such  as  mummy  rot  and  lycan-

thropy.

Slow Fall (Ex): When within arms reach of a wall, Ulmo can

use it to slow his descent while falling. He takes damage as if the

fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still  Mind  (Ex): +2  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  spells

and effects from the enchantment school.

Trapfinding (Ex): Ulmo can use a Search check to locate a

trap when the task has a DC higher than 20.

Trap  Sense  (Ex): Against  attacks  by  traps,  Ulmo  gets  a  +3

bonus  on  Reflex  saves  and  a  +3  dodge  bonus  to  Armor  Class.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Ulmo can react to danger before his

senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dex-

terity bonus to Armor Class even when caught flat-footed.

Possessions: Small +1 kama, Small +1 shortbow, 50 masterwork

arrows, ring of protection +2, wand of greater invisibility (24 charges),

wand of mage armor (46 charges), boots of striding and springing,

cloak  of  resistance  +2,  gloves  of  dexterity  +4,  periapt  of  wisdom  +2.

THE FATED CHAMPION

Martyrdom is the inevitable doom of the fated champion. She

knows  that  her  passion  for  righteous  deeds  will  lead  to  her

death, and so all that she does is tinged with a melancholy fatal-

ism. At times, she might speak glowingly about the great reward

that  certainly  awaits  her  and  her  companions  in  the  celestial

realms, but at other times she focuses on the inevitability of her

doom. Her heroism is undiminished by her certainty that it will

cause her death, however, and she is capable of truly astonishing

acts of valor performed with no regard for her own safety.

The fated champion takes on only the most dangerous quests.

If a holy artifact or relic needs to be recovered from the prison

plane of Carceri, the fated champion attempts it. If need be, she

stays  behind  while  her  friends  carry  the  relic  through  a  gate

leading home, making sure they are not followed before the gate

closes even though it means she is trapped there forever.

Sample Fated Champion

The  youngest  child  of  a  noble  family,  Regina  was  raised  in  a

peaceful  abbey  dedicated  to  Pelor,  but  early  in  her  life  she

demonstrated far more interest in the martial path. The gentle

scholars  of  the  abbey  tried  at  first  to  restrain  her  violent  ten-

dencies, then sent her to live with an order of warriors devoted

to Raziel. There she found her true calling as a soldier in a holy

war against a demonic cult. While she derives great satisfaction

from the good works she performs, she has lost too many allies

and friends to believe that any other fate awaits her than death.

Her ultimate goal is to die a good deathnot gurgling on the

THE BENEVOLENT

HEALER

A benevolent healer

need not be a cleric.

The benevolent healer is a kindly soul

devoted  to  helping  othersoften  a

healer  in  the  literal  sense,  a  cleric

boasting a full complement of healing spells. Alternatively, she

might be a bard who uses her music to inspire and uplift, a druid

who  tends  the  plants  and  animals  in  a  peaceful  grove,  or  an

adventuring sorcerer who concentrates on protective spells to

enhance her companions abilities. She is generally not a front-

line  fighter,  and  often  refuses  to  participate  in  combat  at  all,

unless  it  is  to  heal  wounded  comrades  so  they  can  rejoin  the

fray. She has a humble attitude and a gentle demeanor.

The benevolent healer goes on adventures not to earn glory

or amass treasure, though money has great power to help and

heal. Rather, she is led to adventure out of her sense of concern

for  othersoften  her  adventuring  companions,  who  are  the

primary recipients of her healing talents. She might also take up

a quest to find a magical cure for a supernatural disease afflicting

a town, help to hunt down a lycanthrope that has been terroriz-

ing a village (seeking his cure, not his death), or join a quest to

find a relic to revitalize a blighted land.

Sample Benevolent Healer

As a young girl, Tasthania Silvershade lost her familyindeed,

her whole villageto a band of marauding orcs. She was play-

ing alone in the nearby woods when the orcs descended on the

village and obliterated it. When she returned to the village, she

discovered  a  unicorn  moving  slowly  among  the  smol-

dering ruins, looking for any survivors it might

be able to heal. The only survivor Tasthania

and  the  unicorn  found,  however,  was  a

young orc warrior. Tasthania wanted to kill

him,  but  the  unicorn  stayed  her  hand  and

healed  the  orcs  wounds.  Tasthania  fumed

while the orc fled. Years later, as Tasthania

reached  adulthood  and  began  her  walk

on the druids path, she was ambushed in

the  woods  by  another  orc  band.  The

leader  of  that  band,  however,  recog-

nized her and called off the attack,

for he was the same warrior that

she and the unicorn had healed

and  freed.  Sworn  now  to  the

ways of peace, Tasthania

counts a number of

orcs  among  her

friends,  and  she

views the redemption

of orcs as her particular

mission  of  healing  in

the  world.  She  also

continues  to  work

side  by  side  with

the  unicorn  to  heal

the  creatures  that  dwell  in

the wood.

THE HOLY TEACHER

The holy teacher is devoted to the practice of sharing his virtue

with others. He might be a teacher in the traditional sense: a

scholar  who  imparts  factual  knowledge  to  others,  perhaps

instructing them in the doctrines of a good religion or the pre-

cepts of a celestial order. Or he might be a cleric or other pious

individual  who  teaches  in  a  moral  sense,  exhorting  others  to

follow the righteous path. Or perhaps he leads by example, the

force of his personality drawing others along the path he him-

self walks.

The holy teacher is drawn to adventures that allow him the

opportunity  to  teacheven  if  the  only  pupils  are  his  own

adventuring companions. He might be drawn along as a guide

or advisor to a party on an important quest for the cause of good,

particularly if that quest deals with ancient lore that falls within

his specialty or involves dangerous moral temptation. He also

often adventures in order to broaden his own knowledge.

Sample Holy Teacher

At the age of six, Veshann saw a trumpet archon, and the sight

changed his life. He was so impressed with the celestials right-

eous majesty, so taken with its unearthly beauty, and so drawn to

the virtue it embodied that he became utterly fascinated with the

Seven Heavens, seeking to learn all he could about the origins of

this  awesome  creature.  Now  twenty-one,  Veshann  is  no  less

obsessed with the Heavens, and he is well on his way to access-

ing the mysteries of the Illuminated Heaven, the highest reaches

of  Celestia.  While  progressing  on  his  personal  path  toward

enlightenment, however, he tries to live his life as a model for

others  to  follow,  particularly  the  rag-tag  lot  of  adventurers  he

travels with. Veshann is neither brilliantly intelligent nor deeply

wise,  but  his  personality  makes  him  a  natural  exemplar  and

leader, and he shares his own experience of the life of virtue in

lieu of passing on any real knowledge or insight. He is happy to

leave  theology  to  scholars  and  piety  to  priests,  while  guiding

others toward righteousness and perfection by example.

ability is always active.

THE PEASANT HERO

The  peasant  hero  is  a  champion  of  the  common  folk  who

achieved  great  things  as  a  result  of  his  virtue.  He  might  be  a

simple  warrior  or  expert,  he  might  start  in  an  NPC  class  and

later multiclass, or he might start off in an adventuring class, but

in any event he never forgets his roots among the peasantry. He

remains humble, but he is defiant of authority and refuses to be

pushed around.

As  an  adventurer,  the  peasant  hero  protects  the  common

people  from  marauding  monsters,  cruel  tyrants,  bullying

nobles,  and  vicious  brigands.  He  frees  slaves  and  shelters

escaped slaves. He is a protector, a champion, and a hero-idol to

the people he serves.

Sample Peasant Hero

Solarian  Goblinslayer  is  a  tough,  sometimes  defensive  urban

hood who has seen too much of lifes darker side. After spend-

ing his youth hanging around with violent gangs, he was jolted

away from a life of crime by the murder of his mentor. When his

street-gang  friends  were  vanquished  by  a  rival  gang,  Solarian

fled the city, carrying an ugly scar on his neck and deep wounds

in his heart. He has a strong sense of justice, honor, and good-

ness, and no tolerance for bullies. After a series of adventures in

which he earned his Goblinslayer appellation, he discovered a

new  home  and  a  new  direction  for  his  life  in  the  temples  of

Pelor,  and  took  up  the  life  of  a  paladin.  He  is  anything  but  a

stereotypical  paladin,  preferring  his  old  rapier  and  studded

leather  armor  to  the  traditional  plate  armor  and  sword  of  the

knightly warrior.

Aura of Good (Ex): Solarians aura of good (see the detect good

spell) is equal to that of a 1st-level cleric.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell of the same name.

Evasion (Ex): If Solarian is exposed to any effect that nor-

mally  allows  him  to  attempt  a  Reflex  saving  throw  for  half

damage,  he  takes  no  damage  with  a  successful  saving  throw.

Smite Evil (Su): Solarian may attempt to smite evil with one

normal melee attack. He adds +3 to his attack roll and deals an

extra 1 point of damage. Smiting a creature that is not evil has

no effect but uses the ability for that day.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex): If  Solarian  can  catch  an

opponent when she is unable to defend herself

effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot

for  an  extra  2d6  points  of  damage.  For  complete

details on the sneak attack ability, see the descrip-

tion  of  the  slayer  of  Domiel  in  Chapter  5:

Prestige Classes.

Trapfinding  (Ex):  Solarian  can  use  a

Search check to locate a trap when the task

has a DC higher than 20.

Trap  Sense  (Ex): Against  attacks  by  traps,

Solarian gets a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and a +1

dodge bonus to Armor Class.

Possessions: +1  studded  leather,  +1  rapier,  4

daggers, masterwork thieves tools, com-

posite  short  bow  (+1  Str  bonus),  20

normal  arrows,  masterwork  buckler,  3

flasks  of  holy  water,  silver  holy  symbol.

THE REDEEMED VILLAIN

The redeemed villain, as the phrase suggests,

was once evil or at least a self-interested neutral. Some-

howthrough the direct action of an exalted character

working for her conversion, or as a result of circum-

stances  and  eventsshe  turned  from  her  old  ways

and adopted a good alignment. Perhaps she started

off  doing  good  deeds  for  selfish  reasons.  Even

done for the wrong reasons, good deeds improve

the  person  doing  them,  and  eventually  she

began doing them for their own sake, finally

becoming  among  the  most  virtuous  of

heroes. More than any other heroic type, the

redeemed villain is sympathetic to those who

still live in their evil ways, and willing to work

toward their redemption as well as her own con-

tinuing improvement. She might still carry a load of

guilt  for  her  past  misdeeds  and  actively  seek  for-

giveness,  or  she  might  quickly  grow  angry  with

anyone who would dare hold her past against her.

She is often more rough around the edges than char-

acters  who  were  good  all  their  lives,  but  is  no  less

dedicated to exalted deeds now.

On adventures, the redeemed villain shows the most interest

in  spreading  the  good  news  she  has  experienced,  offering

redemption  to  other  villains  but  fighting  fiercely  when  her

attempts are met with violence. Some are much like righteous

crusaders,  smiting  evil  monsters  wherever  they  are  found,

while others focus their attention primarily on humanoid vil-

lains,  foiling  their  vile  schemes  and  hoping  to  guide  them  to

change their ways.

Sample Redeemed Villain

Thaqualm  is  an  extraordinary  redeemed  villain:  a  mind  flayer

who has joined the cause of good. Living deep underground on

the outskirts of a mind flayer city, Thaqualm was a victim of a

small-scale slave rebellion: Her duergar thralls broke free of her

mental control and forced her into three years of wretched servi-

tude, her mental powers suppressed and her body at the verge of

starvation. Finally, she was liberatedby an adventuring party

from the surface who killed her duergar masters but spared the

pathetic illithid, showing her kindness unlike any-

thing she had ever experienced before. Eventually,

she joined the adventurers and traveled with them

for two years. She joined a monastic order, and has

now retired to a life of contemplation. She has

sworn a vow of nonviolence and works hard

to  redeem  any  evil  humanoids  she  may

encounter, hoping to set them on the same

course  that  has  proven  so  rewarding  for  her.

New feat described in Chapter 4 of this book.

Extract (Ex): If Thaqualm begins her turn with all four ten-

tacles attached and wins a grapple check, she auto-

matically  extracts  the  opponents  brain,  instantly

killing that creature. This power is useless against

constructs,  elementals,  oozes,  plants,  and  undead.

Extraction is not instantly fatal to foes with multiple heads, such

as ettins and hydras.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Thaqualm must hit

a Small, Medium, or Large creature with her tentacle attack. She

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity. If she wins the grapple check,

she  establishes  a  hold  and  attaches  the  tentacle  to  the  oppo-

17

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  1:49 PM  Page 18

nents head. Thaqualm can grab a Huge or larger creature, but

only  if  she  can  somehow  reach  the  foes  head.  If  Thaqualm

begins its turn with at least one tentacle attached, she can try to

attach its remaining tentacles with a single grapple check. The

opponent can escape with a single successful grapple check or

an  Escape  Artist  check,  but Thaqualm  gets  a  +2  circumstance

bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the beginning of

the opponents turn.

Ki Strike (Su): Thaqualms unarmed strike can deal damage to

a creature with damage reduction as if the blow were made with

a magic and lawful weapon.

Mind  Blast  (Sp):  This  attack  is  a  cone  60  feet  long.  Anyone

caught in this area must make a DC 16 Will save or be stunned

for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. This ability is

the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At willcharm monster (DC 16), detect thoughts

(DC 14), levitate, plane shift, suggestion (DC 15). Caster level 8th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Evasion (Ex): If Thaqualm is exposed to any effect that nor-

mally  allows  her  to  attempt  a  Reflex  saving  throw  for  half

damage,  she  takes  no  damage  with  a  successful  saving  throw.

Purity of Body (Ex): Thaqualm has immunity to all diseases

except for magical diseases such as mummy rot and lycanthropy.

Slow Fall (Ex): When within arms reach of a wall, Thaqualm

can use it to slow her descent while falling. She takes damage as

if the fall were 40 feet shorter than it actually is.

Still  Mind  (Ex):  +2  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  spells

and effects from the enchantment school.

Telepathy (Su): Thaqualm can communi-

cate  telepathically  with  any  crea-

ture  within  100  feet  that  has  a

language.

Wholeness of Body (Su): Thaqualm

can cure up to 16 hp of her own wounds

each day, and she can spread this healing

out over several uses.

Prestige Class Options: champion of Gwynharwyf, risen martyr,

skylord, sword of righteousness.

THE EXALTED BARD

While many bards are roguish scoundrels, the exalted bard is an

artiste  who  is  attuned  to  the  music  of  the  heavens  and  the

poetry  of  creation.  Often  closely  aligned  with  the  eladrins,

exalted bards are perfectly suited to subduing opponents with-

out killing them by using their powerful enchantments. They

also  command  the  power  of  human  emotion,  inspiring  hope

and courage in their allies. Exalted bards are perhaps the ulti-

mate diplomats, combining skill and natural Charisma to avert

conflict as often as not.

Exalted Feat Choices: Favored of the Companions or Knight of

Stars, Holy Radiance, Nimbus of Light, Nymphs Kiss, Sanctify

Martial Strike, Words of Creation.

Prestige Class Options: apostle of peace, exalted arcanist, risen

martyr, stalker of Kharash, troubadour of stars, wonderworker.

THE EXALTED CLERIC

By necessity, an exalted cleric serves a good deityHeironeous,

Ehlonna,  Pelor,  Kord,  Moradin,  Yondalla,  Garl  Glittergold,

Bahamut, or perhaps one of the deities described in this chapter.

Though good-aligned clerics might worship the lawful neutral

St. Cuthbert or the chaotic neutral Olidammara, good clerics of

neutral deities are not wholly devoted to good and thus gener-

ally not permitted to gain exalted feats.

Exalted clerics are the perfect servants of good deities, living

extensions of their deities will. Their understanding of good is

filtered through their deities dogma and priorities: a cleric of

Heironeous  is  primarily  interested  in  fighting  evil,  while  a

cleric of Pelor spends much effort in helping and healing the

common folk. Both are equally good, equally exalted,

and they might even be of the same alignment, but

their  priorities  differ.  Their  faith  is  the  lens

through which they view both the world and

Possessions: Bracers of armor +6, monks belt, ring

of protection +4.

EXALTED CHARACTERS

A chaotic good barbarian swinging a holy greataxe is a very dif-

ferent  character  than  a  chaotic  good  sorcerer  wielding  holy

arcane power. Members of different character classes follow the

exalted path in different ways. The following section describes

some of those ways, including exalted feat choices and prestige

class options for characters of each basic class.

Exalted  Feat  Choices: Consecrate  Spell Trigger,  Exalted Turn-

ing, Favored of the Companions, Holy Radiance, Holy Sub-

dual,  Knight  of  Stars,  Nimbus  of  Light,  Purify  Spell

Trigger, Sacred Vow, Sanctify Martial Strike, Servant

of the Heavens, Words of Creation.

Prestige Class Options: apostle of peace, celestial

mystic,  defender  of  Sealtiel,  emissary  of

Barachiel,  fist  of  Raziel,  prophet  of

Erathaol,  risen  martyr,  sentinel  of

Bharrai, wonderworker.

THE EXALTED BARBARIAN

THE EXALTED DRUID

Not at all the oxymoron some might think, an exalted barbarian

is chaotic good by necessity. He stands opposed to the evil in

decadent  urban  society,  the  tyranny  of  evil  rulers,  and  the

machinations of devils. An exalted barbarians rage is an earthly

manifestation of celestial wrath against the forces of evil. His

greatest challenge is ensuring that, in the heat of his rage, he

does not commit an evil action by mistake.

Exalted  Feat  Choices: Knight  of  Stars,  Quell  the  Profane,

Resounding  Blow,  Righteous  Wrath,  Sanctify  Martial  Strike.

If  exalted  bards  are  closely  associated  with  the  eladrins,  then

exalted druids are linked to the bestial-seeming guardinal celes-

tials.  Like  the  guardinals,  exalted  druids  are  both  devoted  to

good and intimately familiar with the natural world. They value

close  friendshipswhether  with  adventuring  allies,  animal

companions, or fey creaturesand particularly hate evil crea-

tures that despoil nature.

Exalted  Feat  Choices: Animal  Friend,  Exalted  Companion,

Exalted  Wild  Shape,  Favored  of  the  Companions,  Holy  Radi-

THE EXALTED FIGHTER

Not every soldier of righteousness is a paladin. Many fighters

march into battle in goods name. Without the divine power of

a paladin to support them, exalted fighters rely primarily on the

martial prowess reflected in their extensive selection of combat

feats,  and  only  secondarily  on  any  supernatural  exalted  feats

they  might  acquire.  Particularly  to  neutral  good  and  chaotic

good characters, the way of the fighter has distinct advantages

over the paladins difficult calling.

Exalted Feat Choices: Favored of the Companions, Fist of the

Heavens,  Holy  Subdual,  Knight  of  Stars,  Quell  the  Profane,

Resounding Blow, Sacred Vow, Sanctify Martial Strike, Servant

of the Heavens.

Prestige  Class  Options: anointed  knight,  defender  of  Sealtiel,

risen  martyr,  skylord,  sword  of  righteousness,  vassal  of

Bahamut.

THE EXALTED MONK

Disciplined ascetics who devote themselves to spiritual perfec-

tion,  good  monks  are  natural  candidates  for  the  extreme

demands of the exalted path. It is a small step from a monks

unarmed and unarmored fighting style to a vow of poverty that

rejects all accoutrements of battle. Likewise, many monks prac-

tice  ascetic  extremities  that  lead  naturally  into  other  lifelong

sacred vows. Good monks stand easily beside paladins among

the finest examples of exalted characters.

course, are called to be exemplars of the lawful good alignment,

and to the extent that they succeed, they are among the finest

examples of exalted player characters as well.

Exalted Feat Choices: Celestial Mount, Exalted Smite, Exalted

Turning,  Gift  of  Grace,  Hands  of  a  Healer,  Holy  Radiance,

Nimbus  of  Light,  Quell  the  Profane,  Ranged  Smite  Evil,

Prestige  Class  Options: anointed  knight,  defender  of  Sealtiel,

emissary of Barachiel, fist of Raziel, prophet of Erathaol, risen

martyr, sword of righteousness, vassal of Bahamut.

THE EXALTED RANGER

Depending on their alignment, exalted rangers may end up sim-

ilar in many ways to paladins, druids, or barbarians. Like druids,

they are at home in the natural world (more so than in the lofty

contemplation  of  the  celestial  planes),  and  are  very  down-to-

earth in the figurative sense as well. For an exalted ranger, good

is not an abstract cosmic principle, but very concretely mani-

fested  in  how  a  person  lives  and  treats  others  around  him,

whether sentient or not. Exalted rangers always choose favored

enemies that are evilthey may have neutral opponents (such

as  lizardfolk),  but  cannot  devote  their  extensive  training  to

fighting opponents who are not actually evil.

Blow, Sanctify Martial Strike.

Prestige Class Options: beloved of Valarian, defender of Sealtiel,

lion of Talisid, prophet of Erathaol, risen martyr, skylord, stalker

THE EXALTED ROGUE

Prestige Class Options: celestial mystic, defender of Sealtiel, ini-

tiate  of  Pistis  Sophia,  risen  martyr,  sword  of  righteousness.

Nimbus  of  Light,  Resounding  Blow,  Sacred  Vow,  Sanctify  Ki

Strike, Sanctify Martial Strike, Servant of the Heavens, Touch of

Golden Ice.

Exalted rogues, while they share the same class skills and abil-

ities  as  their  nongood  kin,  are  as  a  rule  not  roguish  in  the

descriptive  sense.  A  lawful  good  rogue  is  as  dependable  as  a

paladin, and a chaotic good rogue might sing with the eladrin

Court of Stars. Even lawful good rogues are not bound to an

abstract and impractical code of honor that would limit their

use  of  sneak  attacks  beyond  the  general  limitations  on  vio-

lence discussed earlier in this chapter. The use of sneak attacks

is no more evil than the use of a bull rush or trampling maneu-

ver:  when  engaged  in  a  life-or-death  struggle  against  the

exalted  paladin  probably  sounds  redundant.  All  paladins,  of

THE EXALTED PALADIN

CELESTIAL MONSTER CLASSES

The  Savage  Species sourcebook  contains  rules  for  treating

monsters  as  character  classesan  alternative  system  to  the

monster  advancement  system  presented  in  the  Monster

Manual.

Unlike  other  classes,  a  monster  class  has  a  maximum

number  of  levels  equal  to  the  creatures  starting  ECL.  For

example,  a  hound  archons  starting  ECL  is  11,  so  the  hound

archon monster class has 11 levels. As a monster attains a new

level in its class, it becomes gradually more powerful (just as a

member of any other class does) until it attains the maximum

level in its class and thereby gains all of the abilities of the crea-

ture described in the Monster Manual.

When using the rules in Savage Species to create a character

with one or more levels in a monster class, you can ignore level

adjustment. This is replaced by your characters monster class

level.

A  monster  character  may  not  multiclass  until  it  completes

the full progression in its monster class. This rule keeps char-

acters from gaining the benefits of a monsters type and then

quickly switching to a standard class.

Appendix  I  in  Savage  Species includes  various  good-aligned

monster classes such as centaurs, djinnis, and treants, as well

as the following celestial monster classes:

Astral deva

Avoral guardinal

Ghaele eladrin

forces  of  evil,  use  tactics  that  help  ensure  your  victory. That

said, a rogues ability to deal sneak attack damage with a sub-

dual weapon (a sap, or a normal weapon if the rogue has the

Subduing Strike feat) makes her very well suited to capturing

foes alive, showing the mercy that good demands.

Exalted  Feat  Choices: Favored  of  the  Companions,  Holy  Sub-

dual,  Knights  of  Stars,  Nymphs  Kiss,  Sacred  Strike,  Sanctify

Martial Strike, Servant of the Heavens.

Prestige  Class  Options: emissary  of  Barachiel,  risen  martyr,

slayer  of  Domiel,  stalker  of  Kharash,  sword  of  righteousness.

THE EXALTED SORCERER

Some exalted sorcerers proudly claim their descent from metal-

lic dragons, while others suggest that their powers come more

directly from the celestial realm. Like wizards, exalted sorcerers

bring arcane might to the fight against evil, much like paladins

wielding staffs instead of swords. They generally eschew necro-

mancy and avoid casting evil spells at all costs. Many exalted

sorcerers learn to channel celestial energies with spells ranging

from  the  1st-level  lantern  light to  the  9th-level  blinding  glory

(described  in  Chapter  6:  Magic),  and  some  few  (those  who

adopt the exalted arcanist prestige class) also learn to channel

limited divine power as if they were clerics.

Exalted  Feat  Choices: Celestial  Familiar,  Favored  of  the  Com-

panions, Holy Radiance, Knight of Stars, Nimbus of Light, Stig-

mata, Nymphs Kiss, Sacred Vow, Servant of the Heavens, Words

of Creation.

Prestige  Class  Options: celestial  mystic,  exalted  arcanist,

prophet  of  Erathaol,  risen  martyr,  sentinel  of  Bharrai,  trouba-

dour of stars, wonderworker.

THE EXALTED WIZARD

An exalted wizard appears as a awe-inspiring figure swathed in

white robes, glowing with celestial energy, and radiating right-

eous  fury.  Like  sorcerers,  many  exalted  wizards  claim  to  have

received  their  spells  not  from  celestial  ancestry,  but  from  the

libraries of the heavenly powers, so that they might use those

spells in battle against evil. Their spell preferences echo those of

exalted sorcerers.

panions, Holy Radiance, Knight of Stars, Nimbus of Light, Stig-

mata, Nymphs Kiss, Sacred Vow, Servant of the Heavens, Words

SIN AND ATONEMENT

The higher ones standards, the easier it is to fall short of them.

There are times in any campaign when players of good charac-

ters make bad choices or are forced into a choice between two

evils and end up committing the lesser. The dangers are great:

paladins  and  good  clerics  might  lose  class  abilities  or  spell

access, and other characters could lose access to exalted feats.

Depending on the severity of the transgression, good characters

might become neutral or even evil, either in one cataclysmic fall

or over the course of a long downward spiral.

The powers of good would be hypocritical if they demanded

that mortals offer forgiveness to one another while themselves

withholding it from mortals who displease them. Therein is the

blessing and assurance that all good creatures can cling to: there

is no sin  so  great that it cannot be forgiven. However, just as

when player characters extend forgiveness to villains, forgive-

ness is predicated upon repentance. A character who has com-

mitted an evil act cannot simply obtain an atonement spell and

carry  on  as  if  nothing  had  happened.  She  must  first  make

amends for her actions, at least trying to repair any damage she

caused and offering sincere apologies to those who might still

hold resentment against her. She must demonstrate a willing-

ness to try harder in the future to avoid such actions, a real com-

mitment to avoiding evil at all costs. In many cases, she must

also perform an act of penance: a good deed that most likely has

nothing to do with reparations to those she injured, but simply

demonstrates her renewed commitment to good.

With all these criteria met, the powers of good joyfully wel-

come straying sheep who return to the fold, and an atonement

spell subsequently cast can have its full effect: restoring a pal-

adins class, restoring a clerics or druids spell powers, or restor-

ing the benefits of exalted feats to any character.

EXALTED ADVENTURES

It is possible to take a party of exalted player characters and let

them  make  their  way  through  any  D&D  adventure. They  are

still  D&D  characters,  even  if  their  motivations  might  differ

from those of many other characters and the abilities they bring

to  bear  might  be  different  as  well.  However,  if  an  adventure

doesnt speak to their motivations, they might take it in a com-

pletely different direction than the DM intended. Likewise, a

campaign needs to address what matters to the characters, offer

them opportunities to shine (in terms of both using the powers

they have acquired and demonstrating their heroic righteous-

ness), and provide them with truly evil opponents to face. This

section, more than any other in this book, is designed with the

Dungeon Master in mind. Nothing here need be off-limits to

players  eyes,  but  DMs  in  particular  will  find  specific  advice

about  how  to  craft  adventures  and  campaigns  that  feature

exalted characters to best effect.

LET HEROES BE HEROES

There are two sides to this maxim. On the one hand, dont put

player characters into situations where the only way to succeed

is to be a scoundrel or a villain. On the other hand, let PCs do

things that matter, that make a difference in the world and in

the lives of its people.

It is okay to put a mature group of players into a situation

where they face a difficult choice between the right thing to

do (from a moral and ethical perspective) and the easy thing to

do.  It  is  also  okay  to  let  them  suffer  a  little  bit,  in  the  short

term,  for  making  the  right  choice  for  righteousness  over

reward.  Good  people  rarely  have  it  easy  in  life,  and  exalted

characters  may  actually  find  themselves  persecuted,  hated,

and reviled. You can force them to suffer setbacks in order to

remain on the straight and narrow path of righteousness, but

as a general rule, dont force them to suffer devastating failure.

This is a general rule, not a universal one: there may in fact be

times  when  a  glorious  martyrdom  for  the  entire  party  is  an

acceptable climax to an adventure or a campaign. If your play-

Good and evil battle to the death.

ers are ready to start a new

group  of  PCs,  younger  heroes

who will eventually rise to vanquish

the evil that claimed the lives of the saints

gone before, or if you envision a period of time

where every PC becomes a risen martyr in order

to bring the campaign to a close, then let the characters find

themselves facing a choice between certain death and ultimate

corruption. It is hard to imagine a more spectacular and rivet-

ing campaign event. If you are not planning such a dramatic

turn, however, stick to the general rule: let their choices be dif-

ficult but not deadly.

Equally  as  important,  let  their  choices  and  their  actions

matter. Dont send exalted characters on dungeon crawl after

dungeon  crawl  with  no  higher  purpose  than  garnering  as

much loot as possible, the better to fight evil monsters with.

Their confronta-

the

tion  with

forces  of  evil  should

not be random or haphaz-

ard, and they shouldnt quest

after  holy  relics  just  so  they  can

use  them  to  smite  the  monster

behind  the  next  door.  Characters

built  around  a  mission  to  combat  evil

dont  want  to  just  combat  it  whenever  they

happen to break down a door and find an evil

monster there. They want to foil nefarious plots, uncover dia-

bolical cults, and slay not just evil monsters, but evil villains.

They need to know that, when they purge a dungeon of every

evil creature within, they have made a difference in the world.

They  have  prevented  future  raids  on  the  nearby  village,

stopped the cultists from calling their archdevil master to the

world,  or  concretely  tipped  the  cosmic  balance  in  favor  of

good, at least for a time.

Along  the  same  lines,  appeal  to  the  PCs  motivationsa

fundamental  rule  of  adventure  design.  Dont  offer  a  sizable

21

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  3:22 PM  Page 22

financial reward to a group of PCs who have all sworn a vow of

poverty.  Better  still,  let  a  group  of  characters  who  might  be

strapped for cash show their true heroism by helping out when

theres no hope of reward. (Later, surprise them with treasure

that more than meets their financial needs. They shouldnt be

good  for  the  sake  of  the  reward,  but  virtue  can  have  rewards

besides virtue itself.) Cast most adventures, if not every one, in

terms of real conflict between good and evil, not just conflicts

between  people  and  monsters  with  lots  of  treasure  involved.

EXALTED HEROES NEED VILE FOES

Much  of  the  material  in  this  book  is  designed  specifically  to

address  similar  material  in  the  Book  of Vile  Darkness. There  are

orders dedicated to the Celestial Paragons to combat the fiendish

cults described there, beneficent spells designed to alleviate the

effects of vile spells, and so on. You dont need the Book of Vile

Darkness to make satisfying adventures for exalted PCs, but truly

vile villains help to create a sense of contrast that makes players

feel that much more heroic. Exalted characters shouldnt strug-

gle to foil the plans of a vaguely sinister bureaucrat who plots

to  raise  taxes  in  his  province.  Instead,  they  should  fight  the

undead hordes of Ystan the Graylord while seeking to

liberate the mentally enslaved soldiers that swell his

armys  ranks,  or  quest  to  destroy  the  demon-pos-

sessed  blue  dragon  Enesstrere,  who  is  gathering  a

demonic  army  to  conquer  all  the

tribes of the desert.

A thoroughly evil villain provides

a dramatic foil for the characters, a

yardstick  against  which  they  can

measure  their  own  virtue.  The

ideal  villain,  in  fact,  is  one

whose life is strangely paral-

lel to one or more of the PCs:

perhaps a character of similar

birth and circumstances, who

simply  made  wrong  choices

at key junctures in his life. If

one of the PCs is a peasant hero

who spent his youth mixed up with

violent gangs but managed to rise above his origins and become

a paladin, then an ideal villain would be one of his old buddies

who  has  become  a  criminal  overlord  in  the  heros  home  city.

Allow the player to see how the choices spelled out in his char-

acters background, as well as the choices he made while playing

the character, have made him the hero he is today, while differ-

ent choices might have led him to the other end of the sword of

justice.

GET TO THE ROOTS

Exalted characters tend to look at the big picture, or at least they

should be encouraged in that direction. If a tribe of once-peace-

ful lizardfolk has started conquering large stretches of human

territory,  exalted  characters  should  wonder  what  caused  the

change in behavior, rather than just slaughtering hordes of neu-

tral creatures. Perhaps a black dragon moved into their old ter-

ritory,  forcing  them  to  relocate,  and  characters  with  enough

patience and skill in Diplomacy can negotiate a peaceful settle-

ment.  On  the  other  hand,  perhaps  a  demonic  cult  has  been

actively recruiting among the lizardfolk, has converted or killed

their leader and seized control of the tribe. Even in this case, the

cause of good is better served by going straight to the top and

unseating the corrupted leader, rather than simply slaughtering

all the lizardfolk the characters can find.

A  campaign  that  features  exalted  characters  should  allow

those characters ample opportunity to address the root causes of

the problems they face, so that they can not only stop evil in its

tracks,  but  also  prevent  it  from  ever  regaining  the  same

foothold.  Rather  than  blindly  striking  wherever  the  many-

headed hydra of evil should happen to rear its next ugly head,

exalted characters should have a chance to root out its origin,

even  to  strike  at  its  heart,  perhaps  in  a  climactic,  campaign-

ending battle.

BRINGING GOOD OUT OF EVIL

Deities in the D&D universe are not omnipotent. They do not

have  control  over  everything  that  happens  on  the  Material

Plane,  even  events  directly  related  to  their  portfolio.  Mortals

have free willexemplified by the willful-

ness of most player charactersand often

choose to act in ways that are contrary to the bid-

ding  of  one  or  more  deities.  If  a  deity  wants

events to unfold a certain way, she must

react to the actions of mortals and try

to  shape  events  and  circum-

stances,  through  her  mortal

servants  and  through  direct

application  of  divine  power,  to

turn  those  actions  toward  her

own  ends.  A  good  Dungeon

Master,  rather  than  forcing

his  players  along  a  certain

course  of  actions  and

events, adapts the events of

the adventure in response to

their  actions  and  brings  the

adventure back around to them.

In  the  same  way,  the  deities  of

good, unable to force mortals to

be good, work to turn even the most evil actions mortals per-

form around to good ends.

As agents of good, many heroes find themselves in the situa-

tion of bringing good out of evil. This is grim work, and even the

most exalted characters loathe the idea that all they can do is

clean up the messes caused by evil. It is important work, how-

ever, for without it humans would quickly lose all faith in good-

ness. When designing adventures for exalted characters, it is not

enough that, after finding a village burned to the ground and its

inhabitants raised as zombies to serve the evil necromancer, the

PCs wipe out the zombie army and slay the necromancer. There

must also be some opportunity for them to bring good out of the

horrible tragedy of the village. Perhaps the players can hold up

the  example  of  the  village  to  quarreling  neighbor  nations,

inspiring them to put aside their differences and cooperate to

help the PCs defeat the zombie army and kill the necromancer.

Afterward, the two nations might sign a lasting peace accord in

the  ruins  of  the  village,  then  work  together  to  rebuild  it  in

memory of the dead.

his chapter includes variant rules covering a variety of

exalted topics, from channeling celestials to incorpo-

rating  voluntary  poverty  and  nonviolence  into  a  game

that often is all about killing monsters and taking their

stuff. These  rules  may  or  may  not  be  suitable  for  your

campaign, and your DM should give final approval on whether

you may use them.

CHANNELING

Certain fiends are known for their ability to seize control of a

creature or object, a phenomenon known as possession. Respect

for the life and dignity of sentient creatures bars good creatures

from  usurping  control  of  another  in  this  manner.  However,

some  celestials  are  content  to  exercise  their  power  through  a

mortal form if the mortal host invites them to do so. Similar in

many  ways  to  fiendish  possession,  celestial  channeling  is  an

important means by which the forces of good work in the world.

Celestial channeling works in a manner similar to the Pos-

sess  Mortal  divine  salient  ability  that  some  deities  have  (as

detailed in Deities and Demigods). In addition to deities, some

celestials have the spell-like ability to invest mortals with their

power in this fashion, and there are spells (channel celestial and

channel greater celestial, both described in Chapter 6) that allow

mortals  to  invite  any  celestial  into  their  bodies  in  this  way.

Unlike  fiendish  possession,  channeling  works  only  if  the

mortal  is  willing. The  celestial  does  not  assume  an  ethereal

form in preparation for possessing the mortal; it simply

merges its own form with the mortals as part of its spell-

like ability. As with possession, spells such as protection

from good block celestial channeling, even if the spells

target is willing to channel the celestial. Similarly, spells

such as dismissal or dispel good, as well as special abilities

that  drive  possessing  spirits  out  of  their  victims,  can

work  on  the  channeled  celestial  even  if  the  mortal

wants the celestial to remain.

A  mortal  channeling  a  celestial  becomes  a  mortal

manifestation of the celestials power. The celestial can

draw on all of the mortals memories, and the celestial

senses  what  the  mortal  senses.  The  mortal  and  the

celestial can communicate telepathically, but neither

has  complete  access  to  the  current  thoughts  of  the

other. While channeling a celestial, the mortals Intel-

ligence,  Wisdom,  and  Charisma  scores  become  5

points lower than the celestials (or remain the same

as the mortals scores if they are higher). An increase

in Wisdom affects the mortals Will saves, and all

three  increases  might  affect  bonus  spells  and

saving  throw  DCs  for  spells  and  special  abilities.

The mortal can use its own skills and the celes-

tials  skills.  If  the  mortal  and  the  celestial  have  the

same skill, use the skill of whichever has more ranks

in  the  skill.  Use  the  mortals  effective  ability

scores to determine skill modifiers.

23

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  3:23 PM  Page 24

The channeling mortal can use all of the celestials supernat-

ural  and  spell-like  abilities,  and  can  cast  spells  known  to  the

celestial if his requisite ability scores are high enough.

The  mortal  remains  in  complete  control  of  his  own  body

while  channeling  the  celestial,  so  celestials  never  allow  non-

good mortals to channel them. The mortal or the celestial can

end  the  channeling  at  any  time,  as  a  free  action.  When  this

occurs, the celestial appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to

the mortal.

EXALTED COHORTS

An exalted character with the Leadership feat may, at the DMs

discretion, acquire a celestial, a metallic dragon, a good-aligned

magical  beast,  or  some  other  creature  of  good  as  a  special

cohort. As detailed in the Dungeon Masters

Guide, use  the  monsters  level  adjust-

ment (when that is available) to

determine  its  effective  cohort

level. For example, a player char-

acter with a leadership score of 8

can  have  a  5th-level  cohort.  A

pixie  has  1  Hit  Die  and  a  level

adjustment of +4, meaning a pixie

is  effectively  a  5th-level  character.

Thus, a player character (PC) with a leadership score

of 8 can have a pixie as a cohort, assuming that he is

committed to the exalted path, that he is chaotic good

(like the pixie), and that the DM agrees.

Table 21: Example Special Cohorts lists a number of good-

aligned creatures that might be available as cohorts to exalted

characters, with their alignment and their level equivalent (Hit

Dice  +  level  adjustment).  See  the  Dungeon  Masters Guide for

more information.

portfolios  and  small  followings.  Nevertheless,  they  exemplify

some of the finest aspects of the good alignment, from joy and

pleasure  to  martyrdom  and  the  fiery  radiance  that  sears  evil.

While few people claim these deities as their sole patron, many

offer occasional prayers or small sacrifices to them.

AYAILLA

The  goddess  of  light,  Ayailla  is  called  the  Bright  Eagle  or  the

Brilliant Mistress. She is the steward of celestial radiance, and

she watches over the good creatures of the sky. She is depicted

either as a phoenix bathed in brilliant light or as a beautiful red-

skinned woman with large, feathered wings.

Ayailla  claims  many  nonhumans  among  her  worshipers,

including giant eagles, giant owls, pegasi, lammasus, cloud and

storm giants, and good dragons. Surprisingly, she is also revered

by some dwarves, including paladins, who quest to bring light

into  the  darkness  of  the  deep  regions,  both  literally  and

metaphorically. Her symbol is a phoenix, and the domains

she is associated with are Glory, Good, and Sun. She is neu-

tral good and her favored weapon is the spear.

Clerics of Ayailla are bearers of her celestial light.

Some  take  that  mission  literally,  such  as  the

dwarves  mentioned  above,  or  clerics  who  use

celestial  radiance  to  combat  plagues  of  undead.

Others  interpret  their  mission  more  metaphori-

cally, working to illuminate and educate people,

teaching  everything  from  basic  liter-

acy  to  abstract  philosophy.

Ayaillas  temples  are  most

commonly found in the

of

cloud-castles

good  giants  or  in

s u b t e r r a n e a n

dwarven  strong-

holds,  where  they

are beacons of light

in  the  darkness.

CHAAV

Olidammara  is  often  known  as  the

Laughing  Rogue,  but  Chaav  is  the

Smiling God, whose laughter comes

from  pure  and  simple  delight  in

the world and its inhabitants.

The god of joy is normally

pictured  as  a  boy  or  very

young  man  with  a  wide

smile  and  easy  manner.  He  is

usually found in the company

of his sister, Lastai.

An exalted wizard and his

loyal dragon cohort

Chaav teaches a dogma of enjoyment, pleasure, and delight.

He cares little for elaborate humor or wordplay, and has no tol-

erance  for  those  who  laugh  at  others  expense.  He  is  often

revered by sprites, good satyrs, and other good fey that share his

delight in simple pleasures. Chaavs symbol is a bunch of wild-

flowers, and his favored weapon is the quarterstaff. The domains

he is associated with are Chaos, Good, Joy, and Trickery. He is

chaotic good.

Chaavs  clerics  work  with  simple  farmers  and  artisans,  and

only rarely join adventuring bands. They labor to bring joy to all

people they encounter, not just the laughter from a funny joke,

but the joy, peace, and contentment with life that a pure heart

can bring. Chaav has some small shrines in small hamlets and

villages,  but  they  are  modest  affairs  even  by  the  standards  of

such small communities.

ESTANNA

Goddess of hearth and home, Estanna is called the Hearthten-

der or the Virgin. She is depicted as a young woman dressed in

commoners garb, often cooking.

Estannas faith teaches the simple virtues of home and family

life. She is revered in many good households, honored at the

lighting  of  the  hearthfire  even  by  people  who  are  otherwise

entirely devoted to a single deity or none at all. Her symbol is a

hearth  and  her  favored  weapon  is  the  dagger.  The  domains

Estanna is associated with are Community, Good, and Protec-

tion. She is neutral good.

Estanna has very few clerics, and needs no more than that.

People  worship  her  without  any  need  for  intermediaries,  and

she  has  no  overarching  agenda  that  requires  a  large  force  of

mortal agents doing her work on the Material Plane. A very few

clerics serve her exclusively, ministering to commoners in their

homes and offering services from curing to midwifery, rather

than any actual priestly function. There are no temples devoted

to Estanna, since she is properly worshiped only in the home.

LASTAI

The sister of Chaav, Lastai is the goddess of pleasure, love, and

passion.  She  is  powerfully  sensual  but  neither  seductive  nor

licentious.  She  is  depicted  as  a  beautiful,  voluptuous  woman.

7 From Monster Manual II.

Lastai teaches that sensual pleasures are meant to be enjoyed,

and is not shy about teaching the proper way to enjoy them. As

goddess of love as well as passion, she stresses the importance of

equality in all kinds of relationships, from business dealings to

sexual intimacy. She teaches the enjoyment of food without glut-

tony,  the  enjoyment  of  rest  without  sloth,  the  enjoyment  of

luxury without greed, and the enjoyment of sex without exploita-

tion. Her symbol is a peach, and her favored weapon is the grasp-

ing  pole  (described  in  Chapter  3:  Exalted  Equipment).  The

domains Lastai is associated with are Chaos, Good, and Pleasure.

She is chaotic good.

Lastais clerics are often called upon to perform wedding cer-

emonies and counsel lovers. They seek out pleasure for them-

selves,  but  that  pursuit  is  less  important  than  helping  others

find pleasure and love in their own lives. Her faith is sometimes

reviled by those who view it as prurient or immoral, but Lastais

clerics argue strongly that sexuality is a good gift meant to be

properly enjoyed, not repressed. Lastai has a few small temples,

mostly found in large cities, that constantly battle against their

undeserved  reputation  as  being  nothing  more  than  glorified

brothels.

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  3:23 PM  Page 26

PHIERAN

Phieran,  called  the  Tortured  God,  is  a  deity  of  suffering,

endurance, and perseverance. He is usually depicted as a strong

man whose body has been broken and twisted on the rack, leav-

ing him with a limp and covered with scars.

Phieran  gives  strength  in  suffering,  eases  pain,  and  exalts

martyrs. He is popular among the desperately poor, and he is

often called upon by those who must endure torture as well as

others  in  great  pain  (including  women  in  childbirth).  His

symbol  is  a  broken  chain  or  a  shattered  rack.  His  favored

weapon is an unarmed strike. The domains he is associated with

are Endurance, Good, Law, and Protection. He is lawful good.

Clerics of Phieran are martyrs in the best possible sense: com-

pletely giving, willing to aid virtually anyone in any situation,

and happy to take on anothers burdens. They are often found

ministering among the poor or in prisons. Phierans temples are

usually  humble  shrines  found  in  the  poor  quarters  of  large

cities.

VALARIAN

Called the Dusk Unicorn, Valarian is a god of the forests and its

creatures,  friendly  to  Ehlonna  and  Obad-Hai.  His  particular

domain  is  good-aligned  magical  beasts:  unicorns,  blink  dogs,

and  pegasi  in  particular.  Some  lammasus  and  androsphinxes

revere him as well. He is always portrayed as a unicorn stallion

with a silvery-gray coat that shimmers with moonlight.

Valarian  teaches  the  protection  of  natural  woodlands  and

proper respect and reverence for the good-aligned magical beasts

that dwell in them. He is a fierce enemy of evil magical beasts such

as manticores, worgs, and chimeras, and he particularly despises

lamias. His symbol is the silhouette of a unicorn rampant in front

of a full moon, and his favored weapon is a unicorn horn (crit  2).

The domains he is associated with are Animal, Fey, and Good. He

is neutral good.

EXORCISM

When evil spirits and fiends use their powers to possess and

corrupt mortals, the servants of good rely on exorcism to drive

them out. The most basic methods of exorcism are spells such

as banishment, dismissal, or dispel evil that can send a fiend back

to  the  Lower  Planes.  Similarly,  a  cleric  can  attempt  to  turn  a

ghost  or  other  undead  creature  that  is  possessing  a  living

victim, causing the creature to abandon the body and flee in its

ethereal form. Certain characters have the supernatural ability

to force possessing spirits out of a body or to censure evil out-

siders, which likewise causes them to abandon the body they

are possessing.

Aside from spells and abilities to expel possessing creatures,

certain  other  abilities  and  items  can  help  exorcists  perform

their grim tasks. A possessing fiend can hide its presence from

even  magical  detection  by  making  a  special  Hide  check  (as

described in the Book of Vile Darkness). The Spell Focus (Good)

feat  applies  to  spells  such  as  detect  evil when  a  character  uses

them to discern the presence of a possessing fiend. Incense of

consecration is  helpful  when  dealing  with  undead  possessors,

and a thurible of consecration amplifies its effect. The most useful

aids, however, are items and substances that fiends find abhor-

rent,  which  make  a  banishment spell  more  likely  to  succeed.

Certain  items,  such  as  angel  radiance,  can  also  increase  the

saving throw DC and spell penetration ability of a lesser spell,

such as dismissal or dispel evil. Items in this category are detailed

in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment.

HEROES OF THE HEAVENS

For some players, having a character who struggles to live up to

the  highest  celestial  ideals  is  not  sufficient:  what  they  really

want is to play a celestial. This is not a task for inexperienced

players, since even the weakest celestials are equivalent to char-

acters of moderate to high level (11th and up). For mature and

experienced players in a compatible party, however, playing a

celestial  can  be  an  entertaining  and  rewarding  experience.

There are four ways to make use of celestial player characters

in a game. One way is to incorporate a celestial into a party of

mortal  characters  of  a  level  similar  to  the  celestials  Effective

Character Level. Integrating a celestial into an existing party of

characters should happen in a dramatic manner. If the players

previous character died, the campaign could portray that death

as a heroic sacrifice that made the celestial characters presence

on the Material Plane possible, at least for a short time. If the

player is new to the group, the celestial could be called through

a planar ally or gate spell, and voluntarily decide to work with the

party for a longer period of time than usual. In any event, the

celestial character should always keep the mortal PCs focused

on lofty goals and exalted quests, never devolving into a simple

combat machine with some unusual powers.

A second option is for all the players to take on celestial char-

acters. In most cases, their adventures should take place on other

planes of existence than the Material Planethe powers of the

heavens generally rely on mortal agents to do their work on the

Material Plane, not adventuring parties of archons or eladrins. If

they  do  adventure  on  the  Material  Plane,  it  should  be  for  an

incredibly  significant  purpose,  such  as  preventing  an  entire

Material-Plane world from being sucked through a vortex into

the  Abyss.  A  world-threatening  cause  such  as  that  might  also

draw celestials of different kinds together in a united purpose,

since most of the time archons, guardinals, and eladrins keep to

their own.

Third, it is possible to run a campaign where each player has

one mortal character and one celestial character. The two char-

acters  are  bonded  in  some  way:  perhaps  the  celestial  is  the

mortal PCs guardian angel. At any given time, a player runs

only  one  of  the  two  characters.  Depending  on  the  campaign,

adventures may shift focus between the all-mortal party and the

all-celestial party, or different adventures may require different

characters in mixed groups. Ideally, the two groups of characters

should  be  pursuing  the  same  goalssome  epic  quest  that

requires action both on the Material Plane and on other planes

as  well.  As  the  mortal  heroes  complete  grand  quests  on  the

Material Plane, they make it possible for the celestial characters

to achieve some of their goals on the Outer Planes as well, for

example. It is possible to set up the campaign so that the mortal

characters are unaware of the part they are playing in a grand

celestial plan, while the players themselves have the satisfaction

of  knowing  the  importance  of  the  work  the  mortal  PCs  are

doingbecause they get to play the celestials who benefit from

it as well.

Whichever model your campaign uses, the game mechanics

for playing a celestial character work exactly the same way. Each

kind  of  celestial  has  a  base  Hit  Dice  and  a  level  adjustment.  A

celestial characters Effective Character Level (ECL) is the sum of

its  base  Hit  Dice,  its  level  adjustment,  and  its  total  character

levels. For example, a hound archon has 6 HD and a level adjust-

ment of +5. Before adding any character levels, a hound archon is

equivalent to an 11th-level character. A hound archon 9th-level

paladin adds her 9 character levels to her base Hit Dice and level

adjustment to reach an ECL of 20. See Table 21: Example Special

Cohorts above for the starting ECLs of celestial characters.

The fourth option for characters who want to play celestials

without taking on a huge array of special abilities is to play a

character with a standard race who has the half-celestial tem-

plate  applied.  Such  a  character  can  make  use  of  many  of  the

options  available  to  celestial  characters  without  being  so

entirely different from more normal D&D characters. A half-

celestials level adjustment depends on the base creatures Hit

Dice,  with  standard  race  characters  simply  using  the  base  +2

level adjustment for the template. Thus, a half-celestial/half-elf

who is a 1st-level paladin is a 3rd-level character.

Level adjustments for other creatures with the half-celestial

template are shown on Table 22: Half-Celestial Level Adjust-

ments.

HEROIC SACRIFICE

AND MARTYRDOM

The essence of heroism is expressed in situations where a char-

acter makes a heroic sacrifice, giving up his own life in order to

save his companions. Gandalf fighting the balrog in Moria so

his companions could escape in J.R.R. Tolkiens The Fellowship of

the Ring is a classic and vivid example from fantasy literature. In

addition  to  covering  his  friends  escape,  a  character  might

insert himself into an infernal machine that consumes his life

force in order to open a portal the rest of the party needs to get

through, throw himself into a negative energy vortex to prevent

an  apocalyptic  machine  from  destroying  the  world,  stay  in  a

blazing inferno in order to close the portal through which devils

are entering the world, or otherwise give his own life for the

greater good. It is hard to reward a dead character (except in the

Upper Planes where his soul goes to rest), but it is certainly pos-

sible to reward the player of such a character.

The  phenomenon  of  martyrdom  is  similar  to  that  kind  of

heroic sacrifice. In the strictest sense, a martyr is a person who

chooses to be killed rather than renounce her religious beliefs.

More generally, a martyr in the context of this book is a person

who chooses death rather than renouncing her purity and her

commitment to righteous deeds.

A character who dies in combat has not automatically made a

heroic sacrifice, nor is she necessarily a martyr. Both sacrifice

and martyrdom require a clear decision on the part of the char-

acter, a willing sacrifice in order to achieve a higher purpose.

Of course, in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, death is not

always the ultimate sacrifice. Like Gandalf, characters who die

heroically are quite capable of returning from death. If the char-

acter can be raised or resurrectedthe body is recoverable or

the other characters can cast true resurrectionthen little reward

is necessary. The DM might consider giving the character a spe-

cial experience award that helps offset (but does not eliminate)

the cost of the level loss for raise dead or resurrection. If the char-

acters have no means of raising the character from the dead, the

character  might  still  return  as  a  risen  martyr  (see  the  risen

martyr prestige class in Chapter 5), remaining on the Material

Plane in order to finish the quest he was on.

If there is no way for the dead character to return, the DM

could reward the player by allowing him to make a new char-

acter  at  a  higher  level  than  she  would  normally  allow.  The

Dungeon Masters Guide suggests that new characters replacing

old characters should begin at least 1 level lower than the aver-

age party level or the lowest-level character in the party. This

makes  creating  a  new  character  generally  a  less  attractive

option than a raise dead spell, thus encouraging party continu-

ity. However, to reward particularly dramatic heroism, the DM

could  allow  the  player  to  make  a  new  character  of  the  same

level as the dead one.

MERCY, PRISONERS,

AND REDEMPTION

When  an  evil  enemy  throws  down  his  weapon  and  pleads  for

mercy,  a  good  character  faces  a  host  of  new  issues,  sometimes

enough to make her wish the enemy had simply fought to the

death. Justice demands mercy, so killing an enemy who surren-

ders is out of the question for a character pursuing the exalted

path of good. Righteousness also encourages the virtue of pru-

dence, and a prudent character certainly recognizes that an evil

person requesting mercy is quite possibly hoping for an opportu-

nity to kill her when her back is turned. How does a good char-

acter extract important information from a prisoner? Is there any

hope of redeeming an evil enemy once he is captured? An exalted

character  wrestles  with  these  and  other  difficult  questions  in

such a situation.

Prisoners must be treated with a certain amount of respect.

Torturing prisoners is out of the question, of course, and gener-

ally  knocking  prisoners  unconscious  again  every  time  they

wake up amounts to cruelty. That said, a certain measure of cau-

tion is reasonable. A regenerating devil who can greater teleport

away with a moments thought can be a very difficult prisoner to

keep  as  long  as  it  is  conscious,  unless  the  party  has  access  to

dimensional shackles. Such a prisoner is best kept so far into non-

lethal damage that it takes a week to regenerate, at least until

better means to restrain it can be found.

Similarly,  enemy  spellcasters  can  be  a  threat  even  when

bound and gagged, and they must be treated with vigilance

not brutality. Items like shackles of silence (described in Chapter

6) are effective in preventing spellcasters from using verbal and

somatic components, but the more powerful (and much more

expensive)  antimagic  shackles are  required  to  ensure  the  caster

cant use even still, silent spells to escape or harm his captors.

Aside  from  the  moral  high  ground,  there  is  one  good  and

important reason to take prisoners rather than kill every enemy:

live  prisoners  give  better  information  than  dead  ones.  (Speak

with dead means that even dead men sometimes tell tales, but

living  creatures  can  give  more  extensive  answers  and  the

number of questions isnt limited.) While evil characters may

readily resort to torture to extract information from prisoners,

good characters simply cant, and even using the threat of tor-

ture (Answer the question or Ill hand you over to Brak here,

who doesnt have the same qualms I do) is morally question-

able.  Fortunately  for  good  characters,  there  are  other  ways  of

making  prisoners  talk.  Charm  and  compulsion  spells  such  as

suggestion and charm monster can do the job admirably. An Intim-

idate check can also cow a prisoner into disclosing the desired

information, even without the use of torture. (Torture simply

provides  a  circumstance  bonus  on  Intimidate  checks.)  This

intimidation need not include threats of physical harm, since

displays  of  holy  power  or  strong  moral  exhortation  can  serve

the same purpose. For that matter, a character with many ranks

in Diplomacy can turn a hostile character friendly on a more

lasting basis, extracting needed information in that manner. At

the DMs discretion, good treatment of a prisoner can grant a cir-

cumstance bonus on this Diplomacy check ranging from +2 (for

the  minimum  standards  of  treatment  that  a  good  character

would expect) to +6 or higher (for truly exceptional treatment).

Getting information from a prisoner is a short-term solution

that often proves useful. It is possible and ultimately desirable

(even though rarely practicable) not only to make an evil pris-

oner  friendly  in  his  attitude,  but  actually  to  change  his  align-

ment, turn him away from evil, and redeem his soul so he can be

set  free  to  commit  evil  no  more.  As  discussed  in  Chapter  1,

sword-point conversion is useless and hardly exalted; the process

of  actually  redeeming  an  evil  creature  is  long  and  involved.

First,  the  captors  must  treat  the  prisoner  with  truly  excep-

tional care and respectfar better than the prisoner knows he

would  treat  the  characters  if  the  situation  were  reversed.  Ini-

tially, an evil character might greet this treatment with scorn

and look for opportunities to escape. When he finds the good

characters gentle but firm, kind but smart in their defenses, he

gains a new degree of respect for them, gleaning at least a glim-

mer of an idea that one neednt be cruel to be strong.

Second, the captors must display a willingness to forgive the

evil  that  the  prisoner  has  done.  If  their  conversation  is  laced

with talk of punishing their captive, or gleeful anticipation of

the punishment he will receive when they turn him over to the

authorities,  he  sees  little  purpose  in  even  contemplating  a

change of heart, instead directing all his energies toward escap-

ing the grim fate they have planned for him. As discussed in

Chapter 1, the possibility of forgiveness is essential in demon-

strating that redemption is possible.

Third, a good character must spend at least an hour every day

with the prisoner, encouraging him to talk about the evil he has

done, and in turn describing the benefits and rewards of the life

of good. This task is best performed by a cleric who can speak

with  authority  not  only  about  mortal  forgiveness,  but  also

divine mercy. Often it is important for a villain to know that the

deities of good will welcome him as a worshiper.

Each day this conversation takes place, even if it begins rather

one-sided, the good character makes a Diplomacy check. The

evil character then makes a special Will save, adding his level as

a  bonus  on  the  saving  throw,  against  a  DC  equal  to  the  good

characters Diplomacy check result. The DM can give the same

circumstance  bonus  on  the  Diplomacy  check  as  for  checks

made to interrogate prisoners. Creatures whose alignments are

listed  as  always  a  specific  alignment,  and  characters  who

would lose class abilities if they changed alignment (including

evil  clerics  and  blackguards),  gain  a  +4  bonus  on  their  Will

saves. Outsiders with the Evil subtype are immune to redemp-

tion in this manner. Neutral (neither good nor evil) characters

take a 2 penalty on their Will saves. Creatures who have been

enthralled by an emissary of Barachiel (see Chapter 5) or who

have  been  subject  to  the  vision  of  heaven spell  (see  Chapter  6)

take penalties on their Will saves.

If an evil character fails seven saving throws in a row at any

point during the process of redemption, the evil component of

his alignment changes to neutral. If a neutral character (includ-

ing a formerly evil character who has already failed seven saves)

fails  seven  saving  throws  in  a  row,  his  alignment  changes  to

good. The change is permanent.

Redeemed villains have no special link to the good characters

who  facilitated  their  redemption. They  might  choose  to  con-

tinue associating with the PCs, or they might strike out on their

own, as the DM decides. However, they are always friendly to

the  characters,  and  feel  that  they  owe  a  debt  of  gratitude  to

them, which the PCs can collect sooner or later.

SAINTHOOD

Even an epic-level character is probably a long way from becom-

ing a deity, at least in most campaigns. However, there is a goal

to  which  the  purest  and  most  devoutly  good  characters  can

aspire  at  almost  any  level:  sainthood.  No  temple  or  religious

organization needs to give its formal approval for a character to

become  a  saint.  Rather,  sainthood  is  a  gift  bestowed  by  the

deities  of  good  and  the  mightiest  celestials  to  those  exalted

heroes who deserve it.

In order to qualify for sainthood, a character must meet the

following qualifications, as well as any additional requirements

set by the DM:

Must be of good alignment

Must have at least three exalted feats

Must never have lost the benefit of exalted feats or class abil-

ities because of committing an evil act, even if the character

properly atoned

Must  at  all  times  behave  in  a  way  the  DM  considers  to  be

exemplary of the exalted path described in this book

Must be at least 6th level

Must make an extraordinary sacrifice (not necessarily his or

her life) for the good of another

A character who meets these criteria and achieves this pinnacle

of sanctification can acquire the saint template, detailed in Chapter

8: Monsters, at the DMs discretion. Upon acquiring the template

(usually shortly after making the great sacrifice that confirmed her

exalted  status),  the  character  sacrifices  her  next  two  levels  of

advancement in order to catch up with the (artificially low) level

adjustment of the template. For example, a 7th-level paladin who

becomes a saint becomes the equivalent of a 9th-level character.

She must accumulate a total of 45,000 XP to gain another level,

becoming an 8th-level paladin and a 10th-level character.

A  saint  is  still  a  far  cry  from  godhood;  she  is  more  like  an

earthly celestial. However, saints have an advantage over ordi-

nary mortals where the good deities are concerned: the deities

always hear their prayers and pay attention. In game terms, this

translates to a handful of minor spell-like abilities. In the game

world, however, people tend to flock to saints in order to receive

their  blessings  and  bring  their  concerns  to  the  ears  of  the

deities. Saints often spend an hour in prayer every day, simply

lifting up the names of those who have approached them for

help and asked them to pray on the supplicants behalf.

TITHES AND OFFERINGS

Good characters give money from the treasure they acquire to

temples, orders, and charitable organizations. Some characters

are required to do so (see Voluntary Poverty, below), while others

just do it because it is the right thing to do. Characters should do

so without any thought that it might be to their own profit. It

benefits the people who are helped by that money, which usually

includes the poor, sick, orphaned, and otherwise needy.

However,  many  organizations  spout  maxims  intended  to

encourage giving by reminding potential donors that generos-

ity  often  results  in  unexpected  rewards,  and  there  is  truth  in

those maxims. Characters give without thought of reward, but

reward often comes anyway.

The DM should track individual or party donations to temples

and other organizations. Even ten percent of the treasure a typical

PC  acquires  on  a  single  adventure  is  a  spectacular  amount  of

money to a commoner or expert, and the DM should make sure

that nonplayer characters (NPCs) who receive or otherwise bene-

fit from the PCs donations treat them accordingly. Whenever the

characters come to the temple they give money to, needing a spell

cast or some other form of assistance, the DM can compare the

usual price of whatever the PCs need with the amount of money

they  have  donated  since  their  last  such  request.  If  they  have

donated more than the spell or service usually costs, the temple

clergy should be more than happy to provide it at no charge, or at

least  at  cost  (for  spells  that  have  expensive  components,  for

example). However, this generally works only if the characters are

regular  donorspast  donations  are  great,  but  the  assurance  of

future donations are what make temple budgets possible.

VOLUNTARY POVERTY

In  many  cultures  and  belief  systems,  the  height  of  purity  is

embodied  in  an  ascetic  lifestyle  that  involves  forswearing  all

material possessions. Such a life is hard for most D&D charac-

ters even to imagine, since their possessionsparticularly their

magic itemsare such an important part of their capabilities. A

character who swears a vow of poverty and takes the appropriate

feats, Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty, cannot own magic items,

but he gains certain spiritual benefits that can help outweigh

the lack of those items. These benefits depend on his character

level. The level at which the character swears the vow (and takes

the appropriate feats) is irrelevant; if he gives up his possessions

at 10th level he gains all the benefits of a 10th-level ascetic char-

acter, with the exception of bonus exalted feats.

AC  Bonus  (Su): A  1st-level  ascetic  receives  a  +4  exalted

bonus to his Armor Class. The bonus increases to +5 at 3rd level,

and thereafter increases by +1 for each 3 character levels. This

bonus  does  not  apply  to  touch  attacks  and  does  not  hinder

incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however,

do  not  ignore  this  bonus. This  does  not  stack  with  an  armor

bonus.

Bonus Exalted Feats: At 1st level, an ascetic gets a bonus

exalted  feat,  and  another  bonus  feat  at  2nd  level  and  every  2

levels thereafter. Unlike the other benefits of a vow of poverty,

a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when

he takes the Vow of Poverty feat; he only gains those bonus feats

that apply for the levels he gains after swearing his vow. Thus,

the  bonus  feat  gained  at  1st  level  is  available  only  to  humans

who take both Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty at 1st level.

Endure Elements (Ex): A 3rd-level ascetic is immune to the

effects of being in a hot or cold environment. He can exist com-

fortably in conditions between 50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit

without  having  to  make  Fortitude  saves  (as  described  in  the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Exalted  Strike  (Su): At  4th  level,  an  ascetic  gains  a  +1

enhancement bonus on all his attack and damage rolls. In effect,

any weapon the character wields becomes a +1 magic weapon,

and can overcome the damage reduction of a creature as though

it were a magic weapon. This enhancement bonus rises to +2 at

10th level, to +3 at 14th level, to +4 at 17th level, and to +5 at

20th level. At 10th level, any weapon damage the character deals

is also considered to be good-aligned, so that it can bypass the

damage reduction of some evil outsiders.

Sustenance (Ex): A 5th-level ascetic doesnt need to eat or

drink.

Deflection (Su): A 6th-level ascetic receives a +1 deflection

bonus to his Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 12th

level, and to +3 at 18th level.

Resistance  (Ex): At  7th  level,  an  ascetic  gains  a  +1

resistance  bonus  on  all  saving  throws.  This  bonus

increases to +2 at 13th level, and to +3 at 17th level.

Ability  Score  Enhancement  (Ex): At  7th

level, an ascetic gains a +2 enhancement bonus

to one  ability score. At 11th level, he gains an

extra  +2  bonus  to  that  score,  and  a  +2

bonus to another ability score. At 15th

level,  he  gains  an  extra  +2  bonus  to

those two scores, and a +2 bonus to a

third  ability  score.  At  19th  level,  he

gains an extra +2 bonus to those three

scores, and a +2 bonus to a fourth ability

score.

Natural Armor (Ex): At 8th

level, an ascetic gains a +1 natu-

ral armor bonus, or his existing

natural  armor  bonus  increases

by +1. It increases an extra +1 at

16th level.

Mind Shielding (Ex): Also at 8th

level,  an  ascetic  character  becomes

immune  to  detect  thoughts,  discern

lies, and  any  attempt  to  discern

his alignment.

Damage Reduction (Su): An ascetic gains damage reduction

5/magic at 10th level. At 15th level, this improves to 5/evil, and

at 19th level to 10/evil.

Greater  Sustenance  (Ex): Once  he  attains  12th  level,  an

ascetic character doesnt need to breathe.

Energy  Resistance  (Ex): At  13th  level,  an  ascetic  gains

resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. At

20th level, this increases to resistance 15.

Freedom of Movement (Ex): At 14th level, an ascetic can act

as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell.

Regeneration (Ex): At 17th level, an ascetic heals 1 point of

damage per level every hour rather than every day. (This ability

cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a

rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes.

True Seeing (Su): At 18th level, an ascetic gains a continu-

sous true seeing ability, as the spell.

OTHER RAMIFICATIONS OF POVERTY

A  character  who  has  forsaken  material  possessions  may  find

himself at a marked disadvantage when it comes to certain nec-

essary expenses, such as expensive material components. One

option is for ascetic characters to beg components from other

party members, who are probably gaining as much benefit from

having  the  spell  cast  as  the  caster  is.  Alternatively,  an  ascetic

spellcaster can sacrifice experience points in place of expensive

components, with 1 XP equivalent to 5 gp value of components.

Having  a  character  in  the  party  who  has  taken  a  vow  of

poverty should not necessarily mean that the other party mem-

bers get bigger shares of treasure! An ascetic character must be

Forsaking material

possessions, the ascetic

gains spiritual strength.

as extreme in works of charity as she is in self-denial. The major-

ity  of  her  share  of  party  treasure  (or  the  profits  from  the  sale

thereof ) should be donated to the needy, either directly (equip-

ping rescued captives with gear taken from their fallen captors)

or indirectly (making a large donation to a temple noted for its

work among the poor). While taking upon herself the burden of

poverty voluntarily, an ascetic recognizes that many people do

not  have  the  freedom  to  choose  poverty,  but  instead  have  it

forced  upon  them,  and  seeks  to  better  those  unfortunates  as

much as possible.

WAGING PEACE

If the Vow of Poverty feat stretches the basic assumptions of the

D&D  game,  the  Vow  of  Nonviolence  and  Vow  of  Peace  feats

shatter them. Characters who dont kill? It is almost unheard of,

and doesnt just cause problems with what happens to charac-

ters as they advance (as poverty does) but raises the question of

how they advance at all. The experience system in D&D relies

almost entirely on defeating monsters in combat. If characters

dont enter combat, they normally dont gain XP. At least, thats

the assumption in most D&D campaigns.

However, the experience system can stretch to accommodate

even completely pacifist characters with the Vow of Peace feat.

First, the XP system as presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide

rewards characters not for killing monsters, but for overcoming

challenges. Characters with the Vow of Peace feat have means at

their disposal to overcome challenges without killing anything.

Their calming aura can stop would-be attackers in their tracks,

and  nonlethal  damage  and  charm  and  compulsion  spells  are

excellent alternatives to damage-causing evocations.

Second, the Dungeon Masters Guide presents options for grant-

ing XP to characters who overcome challenges that have nothing

to do with slavering monsters or deadly traps. If the DM is willing

to construct encounters or entire adventures where a pacifist char-

acters skills at negotiation and other means of dealing with seri-

ous  noncombat  situations  are  tested,  she  can  award  XP  for

noncombat encounters, as described in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

A free-form XP system is another way to handle games that de-

emphasize combat. Characters receive a number of XP per char-

acter level per encounter (75 XP per level works well), per game

session (depending on the length of your sessions, 200400 XP

per level is a reasonable range), or per adventure (again depending

on the length of the adventure, 5001,000 XP per level, bearing in

mind that 1,000 XP per level equates to gaining a level).

Even characters who have sworn a vow of peace can and should

receive XP for combat encounters that involve the destruction of

constructs and undead. These unliving creatures are not covered

by a vow of peace, and destroying them can be an appropriate goal

for the most exalted character. Likewise, the DM should give full

normal  XP  for  combat  encounters  where  pacifist  characters

subdue  or  otherwise  incapacitate  opponents.  Other  types  of

encounters  the  DM  might  consider  granting  XP  awards  for

include the following:

Redeeming  an  evil  character.  This  is  worth  an  additional

award (assuming an initial award for subduing the character)

equal  to  the  award  for  defeating  the  character  in  combat.

Negotiating  to  avoid  combat  or  avert  a  larger  confrontation.

This is worth an award at least equal to the award that would

have been gained for plunging into combat and defeating the

opponents.

Destroying an irredeemably evil magic item or artifact. Use

the caster level of the item (20th level for an artifact) as a CR

for the encounter to determine XP.

Sacrificing ones life to save others or suffering martyrdom. If

the character returns from the dead, he should receive an XP

award  equal  to  at  least  100  XP  per  character  level,  which

might help counterbalance a lost level.

Using  these  guidelines  as  a  starting  point,  the  DM  can  con-

struct adventures and encounters that allow all the characters in

a partypacifist or notto shine and continue to advance levels.

The DM should never set out to punish a character for taking

the Vow of Peace feat. For the DM to pronounce one session, A

gnat got through the strainer in your drinking water this morn-

ing, you swallowed it, and now you need an atonement, is simply

capricious and unnecessarily antagonistic to the player. The DM

and the players should all work together to ensure that a char-

acter with Vow of Peace contributes something to the game so

that everyone can enjoy it more. It is okay to put a pacifist char-

acter in a situation where refusing to fight is a difficult (but still

viable) option, but not to take away the choice entirely.

WORDS OF CREATION

The Words of Creation are fragments of a lost language thought

to be the precursor of the Celestial tongue. Very few celestials

remember some of these words, and even fewer mortals have

access to one or two of them as well. So great is their power that

no  mortal  mind  can  comprehend  more  than  three  or  four

words, and no evil tongue can speak them or bear their sound. A

character must take the Words of Creation feat to be able to use

these words in any way.

It is possible, though difficult, to communicate entirely using

the Words of Creation. It has no words for evil concepts such as

misery, despair, hate, and betrayal, while the subtlety of its termi-

nology for beauty, kindness, and mercy is astonishing. It has no

written form, and if transliterated into writing it loses all power

and meaning.

Besides communication, there are four essential ways to use

the Words of Creation.

CELESTIAL CHOIR

The Words of Creation can be woven into song, forming music

that surpasses any earthly melody and echoes the grandeur of

the music of the heavens. A bard who has the Words of Creation

feat can use these powerful words to enhance his bardic music

ability as detailed below. When a bard uses the Words of Cre-

ation in this manner, it is extremely draining, and the bard takes

1d4  points  of  nonlethal  damage  for  each  rank  in  Perform

required to produce the bardic music effect he is enhancing. For

example,  if  Devis  uses  the  Words  of  Creation  to  double  an

inspire courage effect (minimum 3 ranks in Perform), he takes

3d4 points of nonlethal damage. If he uses the words to enhance

an  inspire  heroics  effect  (minimum  18  ranks  in  Perform),  he

takes 18d4 points of nonlethal damage.

The Words  of  Creation  doubles  the  effect  of  several  bardic

music abilities:

Inspire Courage: Double the morale bonus on saving throws

against charm and fear and the morale bonus on attack and

weapon damage rolls (+2 at 1st level, +4 at 8th level, +6 at 14th

level, +8 at 20th level).

Inspire Competence: +4 competence bonus on skill checks.

Inspire  Greatness:  Gain  4  bonus  Hit  Dice  (d10s),  the  com-

mensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the targets

Constitution modifier to these bonus Hit Dice), +4 compe-

tence bonus on attacks, and +2 competence bonus on Forti-

tude saves.

Inspire Heroics: +8 morale bonus on saving throws, +8 dodge

bonus to AC.

For bardic music abilities that require a Perform check (coun-

tersong,  fascinate),  the  Words  of  Creation  grant  the  bard  a  +4

sacred bonus on the check. The Words of Creation also increase

the saving throw DC for the suggestion and dominate abilities by +2.

The  Words  of  Creation  increase  the  bards  effective  caster

level for the song of freedom by +2.

CREATION

In  accordance  with  their  original  purpose,  the Words  of  Cre-

ation can greatly enhance any process of  creation.  If  they  are

spoken as part of the casting of a Conjuration (Creation) spell,

the duration of the spell is doubled (as if the Extend Spell feat

had been applied to it, but without increasing the spells level).

Spells with an instantaneous duration are not affected. If they

are spoken while using any Craft skill, they grant the crafter a +4

sacred bonus on the Craft check. These uses of the Words of Cre-

ation do not deal nonlethal damage to the speaker.

EXALTED POWER

The  Words  of  Creation  help  energize  good  magic  items  and

spells. If used in conjunction with a good spell that has a verbal

component, the Words of Creation increase the spells effective

caster level by +1. If used when creating a good magic item, the

Words of Creation increase the items caster level by +1 without

increasing the cost. Both caster level increases are considered

sacred bonuses.

Using the Words of Creation to enhance a good spell deals 1d4

points of nonlethal damage to the caster per 2 spell levels (none

for a 0- or 1st-level spell, up to 4d4 for a 9th-level spell). Using

them to enhance a magic item deals no nonlethal damage, since

their use is measured out over a long period of time.

TRUE NAME

Each creature has a unique true name among the Words of Cre-

ation.  No  mortal  is  familiar  with  the  countless  true  names  of

every creature in the world, no matter how extensively she has

studied the Words of Creation. Nevertheless, a character famil-

iar with the Words of Creation can research a specific creatures

true name if she has access to legend lore and either contact other

plane or  commune. Researching  a  true  name  is  similar  to

researching a new spell. It requires one week per 2 HD of the

creature and an expenditure of 1,000 gp per week. The character

must cast (or have cast on her behalf ) legend lore once each week,

but  the  material  component  cost  is  included  in  the  research

cost. At the end of the research time, the character must cast

commune or contact other plane, paying the XP cost for commune if

applicable. Then she makes a Knowledge check, using the spe-

cialty appropriate to the target creatures type (arcana for a con-

struct or dragon, religion for an undead, and so on). The DC for

this check is 10 + the creatures Hit Dice. If the check succeeds,

the character has discovered the creatures true name. If it fails,

the character must go through the research process again if she

wants to keep trying.

Once a character has discovered a creatures true name, she can

exercise her power over that creature in a number of different ways.

She can impose a 4 penalty on the creatures saving throws to

resist a specific compulsion spell or effect.

She can reduce the creatures spell resistance by 4 or reduce

the amount of its damage reduction by 5. This reduction lasts

for 1 minute.

She can cast teleport or greater teleport on the creature without

including herself as a target of the spell.

She can gain a +6 bonus on her opposed Charisma check to

compel service from the creature after she summons it with a

planar binding spell.

Each  of  these  actions  requires  a  full-round  action,  which

includes speaking the creatures true name and a binding incan-

tation in the Words of Creation. Uttering the incantation deals

5d4 points of nonlethal damage to the speaker. The character

and the creature do not have to be in the same area or even the

same planeit is possible, for example, to reduce a creatures

spell resistance before using planar binding to summon it to the

Material Plane. The one exception is the teleportation function,

which requires the character to touch the creature after speak-

ing its true name and the incantation.

he  equipment  found  in  this  chapter  represents  the

tools of the exalted character. Some itemssanctified

weapons  and  nonlethal  weaponsare  readily  available

to anyone who can pay the price. Others, such as relics

and special ingredients, are much harder to come by, and

in  the  case  of  those  special  ingredients  that  come  from  the

bodies of good-aligned creatures, are often illegal to buy or sell.

The DM must decide whether such items are ever available for

sale in his campaign.

SANCTIFIED WEAPONS

Certain  weapons,  whether  through  association  with  a  holy

person or site or some other infusion of holy power, are con-

sidered  sanctified.  When  a  character  with  the  Sanctified

Weapon feat casts align weapon, the affected weapon is sancti-

fied. A weapon wielded by a character with the Sanctified Mar-

tial Strike feat is also considered sanctified.

Sanctified weapons are not inherently magical, though they

are inherently good and radiate a faint aura of good. A sancti-

fied  weapon  deals  1  extra  point  of  holy  damage  against  evil

creatures, or 1d4 points of damage against evil outsiders and

evil  undead.  In  addition,  creatures  with  the  corrupted  tem-

plate (described in the Book of Vile Darkness) cannot recover hit

point damage dealt by a sanctified weapon by means of normal

healing, including fast healing.

VARIANT RULE:

BETTER SANCTIFIED WEAPONS

In  a  campaign  devoted  to  combating  the  depraved

depths  of  evil,  it  might  be  appropriate  to  increase  the

power of sanctified weapons. Several options for better

sanctified weapons are presented below. Your Dungeon

Master might choose one of these options to apply to

all  sanctified  weapons  or  allow  a  character  with  the

Sanctified  Weapon  feat  to  choose  one  extra  rider

effect  for  the  blessing  when  casting  align  weapon.

Certain creatures might have particular vulnerabil-

ities  to  sanctified  weapons.  For  example,  lycan-

thropes (all of them or just certain varieties) might

be as vulnerable to sanctified weapons as they are

to  silver  weapons.  A  variety  of  plantlike  fiend

might  be  vulnerable  to  a  sanctified  sickle  or

scythe, so that any hit dealt by such a weapon is

automatically a critical hit.

A sanctified weapon might, through supernatu-

ral holy power, allow the wielder to score criti-

cal hits against undead creatures. The weapons

threat  range  and  critical  multiplier  are

unchanged, and (even if the weapon is the sub-

ject of a bless weapon spell) the wielder must still

roll to confirm a threat. This variant rule does not

allow  a  character  to  sneak  attack  an  undead

creature or to score critical hits against other types of crea-

tures that are normally immune to them.

NONLETHAL WEAPONS

Part of the ethos of good is respect for life, a respect that often

leads  good  characters  to  avoid  killing  other  characters,  even

monsters, that might instead be redeemed. Some cultures and

races  have  developed  weapons  designed  to  deal  nonlethal

damage  or  simply  immobilize  an  opponent.  Such  weapons

include the bolas, net, sap, and tanglefoot bag described in the

Players  Handbook,  as  well  as  more  exotic  weapons  such  as  the

grasping pole (also called the mancatcher or sasumata, and sim-

ilar to the pincer staff of the kuo-toa) and the entangling pole

(also called the sodegarami or sleeve tangler).

Entangling Pole: The entangling pole is a highly specialized

weapon, used to catch and entangle an opponent without caus-

ing great harm. It is normally used to hook and catch the cloth-

ing of an opponent. When you use an entangling pole in this

way, you make a grapple attack without provoking an attack of

opportunity. You make a melee touch attack with the weapon to

grab the targets clothing. This attack does not work against a

character in heavy armor, or against most monsters that do not

wear  clothing  (though  it  does  work  against  a  monster  with

shaggy  fur).  If  the  touch  attack  is  successful,  you  make  an

opposed grapple check, using the size modifier for the entan-

gling pole (+4 for a two-handed weapon) instead of your own

size.  If  you  win  the  opposed  check,  you  have  a  hold  on  the

target, but you do not deal any damage. If you lose, you fail to

start the grapple.

To maintain the grapple, you do not need to move into your

opponents space. The entangling pole holds your opponent 10

feet away from you. While you maintain the grapple, you do not

have the option to damage or pin your opponent. Your oppo-

nent  can  try  to  escape  or  wriggle  free,  attack  with  a  light

weapon, or cast a spell with no somatic components and a cast-

ing time of 1 standard action.

An entangling pole can also be used as a normal weapon, deal-

ing  the  damage  shown  on  Table  31  but  not  entangling  the

opponent.

An entangling pole has reach. You can strike opponents 10

feet  away  with  it,  but  you  cant  use  it  against  an  adjacent  foe.

Grasping Pole: The grasping pole is a pole arm designed to

capture  opponents  with  a  minimum  of  harm.  A  wielder  who

hits  a  Small  or  Medium  opponent  with  a  grasping  pole  can

immediately initiate a grapple (as a free action) without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity. (See Grapple in Chapter 8: Combat

of the Players Handbook for more information.) In addition to

the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a grasp-

ing pole can attempt to pull his target to the ground (the equiv-

alent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary).

A grasping pole has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet

away with it, but you cant use it against an adjacent foe.

Lasso: A lasso is an entangling weapon that deals no damage,

but it entangles only parts of an opponents body. When you use

a  lasso  to  entangle  your  opponents  arms,  you  make  a  ranged

touch attack against your target. A lassos maximum range is 30

feet. If you hit, the target is partially entangled, taking a 2 on

attack  rolls  and  a  4  penalty  on  effective  Dexterity. The  crea-

tures speed is not reduced, and it can still charge or run, but if

you  control  the  trailing  rope  by  succeeding  at  an  opposed

Strength check while holding it, the lassoed creature can only

move within the limits that the rope allows. If the lassoed crea-

ture attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a DC 15 Con-

centration check or be unable to cast the spell.

The lassoed creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist

check  as  a  full-round  action.  The  lasso  has  2  hp  and  can  be

broken with a DC 23 Strength checkalso a full-round action.

Alternatively, you can use a lasso to make trip attacks. If you

are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso

to avoid being tripped.

Truncheon: A truncheon is essentially a heavier version of

the  sapa  one-handed  martial  weapon  that  deals  nonlethal

damage. As with a sap, a rogue wielding a truncheon can deal

extra nonlethal damage with a sneak attack, but only if she is

proficient in its use.

RAVAGES AND AFFLICTIONS

Poison and disease are generally the tools of evil monsters and

characters, implements of corruption and destruction. If snakes

and  vermin  are  associated  with  evil,  as  they  are  in  many  cul-

tures, it is usually because of their venom that they are viewed in

such  a  negative  light  despite  their  neutral  alignment.  Using

poison that deals ability damage is an evil act because it causes

undue suffering in the process of incapacitating or killing an

opponent.  Of  the  poisons  described  in  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide, only one is acceptable for good characters to use: oil of

taggit,  which  deals  no  damage  but  causes  unconsciousness.

Ironically,  the  poison  favored  by  the  evil  drow,  which  causes

unconsciousness as its initial damage, is also not inherently evil

to use.

Besides  the  curative  abilities  of  clerics  and  paladins,  the

powers of good have their own answer to poison and disease:

ravages and afflictions, magical traumas that turn the moral cor-

ruption of evil creatures into physical corruption that wracks

their bodies. Ravages and afflictions

affect  only  evil  creatures,  and  are

particularly  debilitating  to  evil

outsidersdespite  the  immunity

to  poison  that  is  common  among

such creatures.

Like poison,

ravages weaken

and destroy

evildoers.

Ravages  function  in  a  manner  similar

to  poisons,  dealing  ability  damage  or  even

ability drain when the target is exposed to them

through  inhalation,

injury, or ingestion,

and  additional

damage  or

other  effects

1 minute after the

initial  exposure.  Afflictions

work more like diseases, dealing

their  ability  damage  after  a  cer-

tain incubation period and on an

ongoing  basis  until  the

victim is cured.

In  contrast  to  most

diseases  and  poi-

sons,  all  ravages

and  afflictions  are

supernatural.

Ravages  can  be  crafted  or  purchased,  just  like  poisons.

Afflictions  can  be  brought  upon  an  evil  creature  through  the

use of the affliction spell (see Chapter 6: Magic), and particularly

holy sites or relics might afflict evil creatures that enter or touch

them. Spells that negate poison and disease function against rav-

ages and afflictions, but they require the caster to make a caster

level  check  against  the  save  DC  of  the  ravage  or  affliction  in

order to successfully negate it.

Ravages  and  afflictions  deal  damage  only  to  evil  creatures.

Any evil creature takes damage

equal to that listed on either

Table  32  or Table  33,  plus  its  Charisma  bonus.  An  evil  ele-

mental or evil undead takes an extra 1 point of damage, and an

evil  outsider  or  an  evil  cleric  of  an  evil  deity  takes  an  extra

2points of damage. If more than one kind of damage is listed,

the  creatures  Charisma  modifier  and  additional  damage  are

added to each kind of damage.

RAVAGE AND AFFLICTION DESCRIPTIONS

Celestial Lightsblood: This rare substance is as ethereal as

pure alcohol, though it is not intoxicating. A pure silvery color,

it first slows and then sickens creatures it affects.

Consuming Passion: Consuming passion causes a creature

to  become  covetous  and  paranoid  as  the  affliction  runs  its

course.

Depraved Decadence: This affliction causes raven-

ous hunger and causes the victim to grow pro-

gressively weaker from hunger.

Eternal  Torpor: Creatures  afflicted

with  eternal  torpor  are  constantly

drowsy and cannot charge or run.

Golden  Ice: This  crystalline  sub-

stance  is  cold  to  the  touch,  though  it

doesnt  melt  except  at  infernally  high

temperatures.  Evil  creatures  subjected

to it feel its cold spreading throughout

their bodies.

Haunting  Conscience: This  afflic-

tion causes a creature to dwell on its evil

deeds,  becoming  guilt-wracked  and

violently angry.

Jade  Water: Jade  is  a  potent

substance, noted for its effects on

certain  kinds  of  evil  supernatural  creatures.

Jade water is simply holy water with a sus-

pension  of  jade  crystals  that  takes  on

unusual potency as a ravage.

Pride  In  Vain: Creatures  afflicted

with  pride  in  vain  obsess  about  their  status  and  appearance,

eventually withdrawing to the point of staring incessantly into

a mirror.

Purified  Couatl  Venom: The  venom  of  a  couatl,  when

milked from the creature and purified, becomes a potent ravage

that severely weakens the victim.

Raging Desire: This affliction causes insatiable sexual desire

while preventing any possible fulfillment of that desire.

Unicorn Blood: Drawn from a willing living unicorn, uni-

corn  blood  retains  its  potency  as  a  ravage  only  as  long  as  the

unicorn that donated the blood remains alive.

RELICS

Sometimes confused with magic items or even artifacts, relics

are  unique  items  that  carry  the  indelible  mark  of  good  upon

them. A relic might be a bone or bone fragment from a martyr

or other holy person, or some object that touched a saint in a

special wayher burial shroud, perhaps, or the instrument of

her  execution.  Holy  power  like  that  of  a  saint,  a  martyr,  or  a

celestial leaves a lingering aura of good that is not magic in the

traditional sense, but nevertheless can have miraculous effects,

usually curative in nature.

All relics radiate an aura of good. An evil outsider or undead

creature that touches a relic is burned as if by holy water, taking

2d4 points of damage. Relics are always considered sanctified, so

if they are used as weapons they deal 1 extra point of damage

against evil creatures or 1d4 points of damage against evil out-

siders and evil undead (see Sanctified Weapons, above).

Like artifacts, relics cannot be manufactured, bought, or sold.

However, each relic has a market price equivalent, for the DMs

use  in  assigning  treasure  only.  These  prices  are  calculated  as

though the relics were magic items. Likewise, relics have a caster

level equivalent for purposes of spell effects and determining the

strength  of  its  aura  of  good,  but  relics  never  radiate  magic,

cannot be identified with the identify or analyze dweomer spells,

and cannot be suppressed or dispelled with dispel magic or anti-

magic field.

Bleeding Statue: This life-sized statue depicts a saint and is

located in a site where the saint lived for an extended period,

performed an important deed, or died. On certain occasions

(no more than once a month, often only once a year, on the

anniversary  of  a  special  event),  blood  drips  from  the  statue,

emerging from locations that reflect wounds the saint suffered

in life. A taste of the blood acts as a greater restoration spell, and

the statue typically produces enough for 1d4+1 doses on each

occasion. The  statue  constantly  provides  a  hallow effect  that

encompasses the area where it is located, such as a temple and

its grounds, with an attached death ward effect that protects all

good creatures in the area.

Caster Level Equivalent: 13th; Market Price Equivalent: 55,000 gp.

Executioners Axe: An instrument of execution used to end

the earthly life of a holy person, an executioners axe relic holds

good and evil in tension within itself. The blade of this greataxe

is stained red with the saints blood. The axe acts as a holy vorpal

greataxe, though it has no enhancement bonus. However, a good

creature  wielding  the  axe  takes  a  2  penalty  on  attacks  and

weapon  damage  rolls,  while  evil  creatures  take  the  normal

penalty for wielding a holy weapon.

Caster Level Equivalent: 18th; Market Price Equivalent: 98,320 gp

and invoking the name of the tortured saint, a character gains

the benefit of a guidance spell.

Caster  Level  Equivalent: 1st;  Market  Price  Equivalent: 180  gp.

Sacred Vessel: This elaborate golden cup is consecrated for

use in a temple of good. Water placed within it becomes holy

water. If an evil creature drinks anything from the vessel, the

creature  must  make  a  DC  18  Fortitude  save  or  contract  the

depraved  decadence  affliction  (see  Ravages  and  Afflictions,

above).

Caster  Level  Equivalent: 1st;  Market  Price  Equivalent: 2,000  gp.

Saints Burial Shroud: The shroud laid over a saint after

his execution, this fine linen cloth still bears the image of his

body  faintly  limned  on  its  surface.  A  good  character  who

touches the shroud is instantly healed of all diseases, while an

evil creature that touches it must make a DC 14 Fortitude save

or  contract  the  eternal  torpor  affliction  (see  Ravages  and

Afflictions, above).

carrying it a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws.

though it has no enhancement bonus.

Weeping  Image:  This  sacred  icon  depicts  a  saint  and  is

located in a site where the saint lived for an extended period,

performed an important deed, or died. On certain occasions (no

more than once a month, often only once a year, on the anniver-

sary of a special event), tears form in the eyes of the image, drip-

ping slowly down the image and onto the floor below. The tears

are holy water, and the image typically produces enough to fill

a flask each time the tears manifest. While the image is weeping

(over a period of perhaps 8 hours), any character who touches it

receives the benefit of a heal spell.

Caster Level Equivalent: 11th; Market Price Equivalent: 65,000 gp.

OPTIONAL

MATERIAL COMPONENTS

Some good spell components are optional (and not specified as

a  component  in  any  spell  description).  These  components

sometimes increase the potency of a good spell, and the compo-

nent is consumed whether it helps or not. You can use only one

optional component in the casting of a good spell, so using two

couatl feathers, or a couatl feather and a lammasu claw, wont

improve your chances.

As  with  any  spell  component,  you  must  be  touching  an

optional  good  spell  component  and  have  it  displayed  promi-

nently for it to function. These optional components can only

be applied to spells with the good descriptor.

Spell components that are derived from the body of a good

creature must generally be freely given, not taken from a dead

creature. Killing a good creature in order to harvest its parts or

organs  is  an  evil  act,  and  often  inflicts  a  curse  or  affliction

upon  the  perpetrator,  at  the  DMs  discretion.  Though  these

items must be freely given, they can still be sold, and thus have

suggested market prices indicated. Most of the time, however,

they are given as gifts and not sold.

:

Ambrosia  (Distilled  Joy): A  mysterious  substance  made

from distilled joy, ambrosia is celestial food, the heavenly suste-

nance  of  Celestia.  Created  by  means  of  the  distilled  joy spell,

ambrosia can be used as a special spell component, in addition

to the other uses mentioned in the spell description.

As an optional component, ambrosia automatically increases

the  effective  caster  level  of  a  single  good  spell  by  +2.  This

increase doesnt stack with previous applications of distilled joy

or any other bonuses to effective caster level.

Angel  Radiance: Captured  in  glass  by  a  special  process

known only to angels themselves, the radiance of an angel is a

potent component. Used as a component for a banishment or dis-

missal spell, or a dispel evil spell used to drive a fiend back to its

home plane, a phial of angel radiance increases the saving throw

DC by +1. It also grants the caster a +1 bonus on her caster level

check to overcome the targets spell resistance. Angel radiance

sheds light as a torch.

Blink Dog Tooth: A spell to which this component is applied

has a 50% chance to confer the ghost touch ability and negate

miss  chances  due  to  blur,  displacement,  entropy,  or  phasing

abilities.

Celestial  Blood: If  a  spell  to  which  this  component  is

applied deals damage, there is a 30% chance that the spell deals

an extra +2d6 points of damage to an evil target. The celestial

who gave the blood must still be alive for this to function.

Couatl Feather: A spell to which this component is applied

has a 35% chance to have its effective caster level increased

by +2.

Couatl Scale: A spell to which this component is applied has

a 30% chance to have its saving throw DC increased by +1.

Lammasu Claw: A spell to which this component is applied

has a 25% chance to have any damage the spell deals increased

by +10%.

Lillend Scale: If a spell to which this component is applied

requires a Will save, theres a 40% chance that the saving throw

DC  is  increased  by  +1. When  the  scale  is  used  by  a  bard,  the

chance increases to 60%.

Pegasus  Feather: If  this  component  is  used  when  casting

detect good or detect evil, the caster learns the number of evil auras

and the power of the most potent aura in the first round of con-

centration instead of the second, and the power and location of

each aura in the second round instead of the third.

Phoenix  Feather: A  spell  to  which  this  component  is

applied has a 10% chance to remain prepared even after being

cast. Casters who do not prepare spells gain no advantage from

this component.

Unicorn Blood: The blood of a living unicorn is a powerful

alchemical substance. It can be formed into a ravage (see Rav-

ages and Afflictions, above) that saps the strength of evil crea-

tures. Also, if a spell to which this component is applied requires

a Fortitude save, theres a 40% chance that the saving throw DC

is  increased  by  +1.  In  either  case,  unicorn  blood  retains  its

potency only as long as the unicorn that gave it remains alive.

Unicorn Horn (Sliver): Removing a unicorns entire horn

kills it, but a unicorn may on rare occasions give a sliver of its

horn  to  a  favored  ally.  If  a  spell  to  which  this  component  is

applied requires a touch attack (melee or ranged), theres a 40%

chance that the caster receives a +1 sacred bonus on the attack

roll.

Unicorn  Tail  Hair: A  spell  to  which  this  component  is

applied has a 20% chance to have its duration doubled.

SPECIAL MATERIALS

The following materials and substances are found on the Upper

Planes and have proven useful in the eternal battle against the

forces of evil.

Aurorum: This luminous steel gleams with varying hues of

pink and indigo. An aurorum weapon, shield, or suit of armor

that has been sundered can be reformed by bringing together its

fragments (a full-round action). The broken pieces bond quickly

and  seamlessly,  restoring  the  item  to  its  previous  state.  The

market price modifier for an aurorum weapon, shield, or suit of

armor is +4,000 gp.

Aurorum has the same hit points per inch of thickness and

hardness as regular steel.

Frystalline: This mineral grows in the icy mountain caves of

Eronia,  the  second  layer  of  the  Blessed  Fields  of  Elysium.  Its

resilient, pale-gold crystals contain divine energy that emanates

from  a  god  that  sleeps  beneath  the  mountains.  Any  weapon

made of frystalline is treated as good-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. The market price modifier for

such a weapon is +2,000 gp.

Frystalline has 15 hp per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

Moonblood: Celestials  use  this  silvery  substance  as

warpaint, painting their faces and other exposed areas of their

bodies  with  elaborately  entwined  holy  runes  before  entering

battle. Proper application of moonblood warpaint takes 1 hour

and  requires  a  DC  22  Craft  (painting)  check;  a  failed  check

means  no  benefits  are  gained  and  the  moonblood  is  wasted.

When  the  moonblood  runes  are  properly  applied,  the

warpaint grants a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class. The warpaint

lasts for 1 day, then is absorbed harmlessly into the skin. An evil

creature that touches moonblood takes 1d6 points of damage.

One application of moonblood costs 1,500 gp.

Serren: Serren  trees  grow  on  Arvandor,  the  uppermost  of

Arboreas three layers. The trees serve as vessels for nature spir-

its, and any branch that falls from a serren tree can be fashioned

into a bow, arrow, or crossbow bolt imbued with a portion of the

trees spirit. Serren bows, arrows, and bolts have the ghost touch

special  quality,  although  this  property  is  not  magical.  The

market  price  modifier  for  a  serren  weapon  (one  bow  or  50

arrows or bolts) is +4,000 gp.

Serren has the same hit points per inch of thickness and hard-

ness as regular wood.

Solarian Truesteel: Mined on the fourth layer of the Seven

Mounting Heavens of Celestia, this fine iron needs no alloy and

shines with a silvery gleam. When forged into a weapon, it gives

the wielder a +1 bonus on the confirmation roll for a critical hit.

The market price modifier for such a weapon is +1,000 gp.

Solarian truesteel has 25 hp per inch of thickness and hard-

ness 11.

Storm Tears: This milky rain falls on the Upper Planes and

usually heralds the death of a powerful champion of good or the

birth of a stillborn child. These milky tears can be collected. A

single vial of storm tears duplicates the effects of a hearts ease

spell  (see  Chapter  6:  Magic  for  details).  Storm  tears  are  non-

magical in nature, and each vial has a market price of 750 gp.

Ysgardian Heartwire: This incredibly fine, flexible metal is

found  only  in  the  deep  mines  of  Nidavellir  in  the  Heroic

Domains of Ysgard. It is not suitable for making an entire suit of

armor, but small sections of heartwire mail can be incorporated

into chain shirts, chainmail, or heavy armor to reinforce vital

areas.  This  reinforcement  has  the  effect  of  increasing  the

wearers AC by +2 solely for purposes of the roll to confirm a

critical  hit. The  heartwire  is  so  fine  and  light  that  it  does  not

increase the armors weight. The market price modifier for such

a suit of armor is +1,500 gp.

his  chapter  features  new  feats  that  enhance  exalted

characters or campaigns. They provide new capabilities

and improve existing ones.

EXALTED FEATS

This book introduces a new type of feat: the exalted feat. Only

intelligent characters of good alignment and the highest moral

standards can acquire exalted feats, and only as a gift from pow-

erful agents of gooddeities, celestials, or similar creatures.

These feats are thus supernatural in nature (rather than being

extraordinary abilities, as most feats are).

A  character  must  have  the  DMs  permission  to  take  an

exalted feat. In many cases, a ritual must be performed; often

this simply amounts to a character swearing a sacred vow, for

example, in the presence of a celestial being. A character who

willingly  and  willfully  commits  an  evil  act  loses  all  benefits

from  all  his  exalted  feats.  She  regains  these  benefits  if  she

atones for her violations (see Sin and Atonement in Chapter 1).

Aura of Good: A character with at least one exalted feat radiates

an aura of good with a power equal to her character level (see the

detect good spell), as if she were a paladin or a cleric of a good deity.

ANCESTRAL RELIC [GENERAL]

You own an ancestral heirloom and can invest it with increas-

ing power.

Prerequisites: Any good alignment, character level 3rd.

Benefit: Choose an item you own. The item must be

of masterwork quality, and it must be an item that once

belonged to a member of your family. Alternatively, the

item  may  have  belonged  to  another  person  to  whom

you are somehow connected, such as another member

of your religious order.

At any time, you may retreat to a consecrated or hal-

lowed  location  and  spend  time  in  prayer  in  order  to

awaken the spirits in your ancestral relic. This requires

a  sacrifice  of  valuable  items  worth  the  difference

For example, a 4th-level paladin has a master-

work bastard sword she inherited from her grand-

father. She makes sacrifices worth 2,000 gp and

spends two days in prayer and fasting in the temple

of Heironeous. When she emerges, her devotion has

awakened  the  magic  inherent  in  the  blade,

making it a +1 bastard sword. When she reaches

ANIMAL FRIEND [EXALTED]

Animals respond favorably to the aura of goodness that exudes

from you.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, wild empathy class feature.

Benefit: You receive a +4 exalted bonus on wild empathy

checks  to  sway  the  attitudes  of  animals  and  good-aligned

magical beasts (including, but not limited to, blink dogs, uni-

corns, pegasi, and animals with the celestial template). In the

case of good magical beasts, this bonus simply eliminates the

penalty you normally take when trying to deal with magical

beasts rather than animals.

CELESTIAL FAMILIAR [EXALTED]

As  long  as  you  are  able  to  acquire  a  new  familiar,  you  may

receive a celestial as a familiar.

Prerequisites: Able  to  acquire  a  new  familiar,  minimum

level requirement (see below).

Benefit: When choosing a familiar, the following creatures

are also available to you. You must choose a familiar whose align-

ment is the same as yours.

The  celestial  familiar  is  magically  linked  to  its  master  like  a

normal familiar. The familiar uses the basic statistics for a crea-

ture of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual or this volume,

except as noted below.

Hit Dice: For effects related to Hit Dice, use the masters level

or the familiars normal total, whichever is higher.

Hit Points: One-half the masters total or the familiars normal

total, whichever is higher.

Attacks: Use the masters base attack bonus or the familiars,

whichever is better.

Saving Throws: Use the masters base save bonuses if they are

better than the familiars.

Familiar Special Abilities: Use the information in the Familiars

sidebar  on  pages  5253  of  the  Players  Handbook to  determine

additional abilities as you would for a normal familiar. With the

exception  of  celestial  animals,  celestial  familiars  do  not  grant

their  masters  any  of  the  benefits  that  appear  in  that  sidebar.

Prerequisites: Paladin level 4th.

Benefit: Your special mount gains the celestial creature tem-

plate. It gains the ability to smite evil once per day, darkvision

out to 60 feet, resistances (acid, cold, and electricity) based on its

total Hit Dice, and damage reduction and spell resistance that

increase as its Hit Dice increase. See the celestial creature tem-

plate in the Monster Manual for details.

CONSECRATE SPELL [METAMAGIC]

You can imbue your spells with the raw energy of good, by the

grace of a celestial power.

Prerequisites: Any good alignment.

Benefit: A  spell  you  modify  with  this  feat  gains  the  good

descriptor.  Furthermore,  if  the  spell  deals  damage,  half  that

damage (rounded down) results from divine power and cant be

reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. For

example, if a consecrated lightning bolt cast by a 7th-level wizard

deals 24 points of damage, 12 points of that is electricity damage

and the other 12 points is not. Thus, a nongood creature immune

to electricity still takes 12 points of damage if it fails its Reflex save.

A consecrated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than

the spells actual level.

CONSECRATE SPELL-LIKE ABILITY

[GENERAL]

You can channel holy power into your spell-like abilities.

Prerequisites: Any good alignment.

Benefit: This feat adds the good descriptor to a spell-like abil-

ity. Furthermore, if the ability deals damage, half that damage

(rounded down) results from divine power and cant be reduced

by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. For example,

if a consecrated lightning bolt from an avoral deals 31 points of

damage, 16 points of that is electricity damage and the other 15

points is not. Thus, a nongood creature immune to electricity

still takes 15 points of damage if it fails its Reflex save.

Each  of  your  spell-like  abilities  can  be  consecrated  three

times per day, though this feat does not allow you to exceed your

normal  usage  limit  for  any  ability.  Thus,  if  a  tulani  eladrin

chooses to consecrate its chain lightning ability, it can use a con-

secrated chain lightning up to three times that day. Thereafter, it

could use its chain lightning ability again normally (since it can

use chain lightning at will), or it could consecrate another of its

spell-like abilities, such as meteor swarm.

CONSECRATE SPELL TRIGGER [EXALTED]

You can channel holy power through a spell trigger item, such

as a wand or staff.

Prerequisites: Craft Wand or Craft Staff, ability to turn undead.

Benefit: When you use a spell trigger item, such as a wand or

staff, you can use one of your turning attempts for the day to

trigger  the  item.  You  still  expend  a  charge  from  the  wand  or

staff. The spell cast by the item is modified as though it had the

Consecrate Spell feat applied to it.

EXALTED COMPANION [EXALTED]

Benefit: When  choosing  an  animal  companion,  you  may

choose a magical beast as shown on the table below. You must

choose a companion whose alignment is the same as yours, so

only a ranger can have a blink dog, pegasus, or unicorn as a com-

panion.  Even  though  your  companion  is  a  magical  beast,  you

can  cast  spells  on  it  as  though  it  were  an  animal. The  exalted

companion has all the normal abilities of a typical creature of its

kind,  as  well  as  the  characteristics  of  an  animal  companion

determined by the druid or rangers level.

EXALTED SMITE [EXALTED]

Your smite ability is empowered with holy energy.

Prerequisites: Smite evil class ability.

Benefit: When you use your smite evil ability, your weapon is

considered good-aligned for purposes of bypassing damage reduc-

tion.

EXALTED SPELL RESISTANCE [EXALTED]

You are particularly resistant to evil spells.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, spell resistance.

Benefit: Against evil spells (spells with the evil designator)

and spell-like abilities used by evil outsiders, your spell resist-

ance increases by +4.

EXALTED TURNING [EXALTED]

You  turn  undead  with  such  power  that  affected  undead  take

damage.

Prerequisites: Ability to turn undead.

Benefit: Any undead creature that you turn takes 3d6 points

of damage in addition to the normal turning effect.

EXALTED WILD SHAPE [EXALTED, WILD]

You can use your wild shape ability to take the form of a good-

aligned magical beast.

Prerequisites: Wild  shape  class  ability,  wild  shaping  class

level 8th.

Instead  of  an  animal  companion,  you  have  a  magical  beast  of

good alignment.

Benefit: You can use your wild shape ability to turn yourself

into  a  blink  dog,  giant  eagle,  giant  owl,  pegasus,  or  unicorn.

42

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  5:09 PM  Page 43

You  can  also  turn  into  a  celestial  version  of  any  animal  you

could normally transform into. (At the DMs discretion, other

magical beast forms might be available to you. In general, only

creatures of CR 3 or lower are possible.) You gain the extraor-

dinary and supernatural abilities of the creature. This ability

counts  as  a  use  of  your  wild  shape  ability  and  functions  the

same way.

FAVORED OF THE COMPANIONS [EXALTED]

You swear allegiance to Talisid or one of the Five Companions,

the paragons of the guardinals, and in exchange gain power to

act on their behalf.

Benefit: Once per day, while performing an act of good, you

may call upon your guardinal patron to gain a +1 luck bonus on

any one roll or check.

Special: Once you take this feat, you may not take it again,

nor can you take either the Servant of the Heavens feat or the

Knight of Stars feat. Your allegiance is only yours to give once.

FIST OF THE HEAVENS [EXALTED]

Your stunning attack is empowered by celestial might.

Prerequisites: Wis  15,  Sanctify  Ki Strike,  Stunning  Fist.

Benefit: The  saving  throw  DC  of  your  Stunning  Fist

increases by 2 when you use it against an evil creature. If the

stunning attack succeeds, the creature is staggered for 1 round

following the round it is stunned.

Special: A fighter may select Fist of the Heavens as one of his

fighter bonus feats.

GIFT OF FAITH [EXALTED]

You  have  an  unusual  capacity  to  trust  in  divine  providence

working all things for the good.

Prerequisites: Wis 13.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist any

fear effect, despair effect (such as the crushing despair spell), or

similar  mind-affecting  condition,  but  not  charms  or  compul-

sions (such as the charm person and dominate person spells).

GIFT OF GRACE [EXALTED]

You  can  improve  the  saving  throws  of  your  allies  by  sharing

some of your divine grace.

Prerequisites: Divine grace class ability.

Benefit: You can give up some of your saving throw bonus

granted  by  divine  grace  and  share  it  with  one  or  more  other

characters.  You  can  sacrifice  any  amount  of  your  own  divine

grace, up to your full Charisma bonus. You can divide that bonus

among allies that you touch, to a maximum of one ally per char-

acter level you possess. For example, if you are a 5th-level pal-

adin with a +3 Charisma bonus, you can give three characters

each  a  +1  bonus  on  their  saving  throws,  one  character  a  +3

bonus, two characters a +1 bonus (keeping a +1 bonus for your-

self ), or any similar division of your +3 bonus.

This shared divine grace lasts for one day or until you revoke

it (as a free action).

HANDS OF A HEALER [EXALTED]

You  can  heal  more  damage  than  normal  by  laying  on  hands.

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  5:09 PM  Page 44

Prerequisites: Cha 13, lay on hands class ability.

Benefit: When  determining  how  many  hit  points  you  can

cure, treat your Charisma score as if it were 2 points higher. For

example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma could cure up

to 28 points of damage per day with this feat.

HOLY KI STRIKE [EXALTED]

Your unarmed attacks deal extra damage to evil creatures.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, Improved Unarmed Strike, Ki strike

(holy), Sanctify Ki Strike.

Benefit: Your unarmed strike deals 2d6 points of extra holy

damage  to  evil  creatures.  In  addition,  it  is  considered  holy,

which means that it can bypass the damage reduction of some

evil outsiders. This does not stack with the extra damage from

the Sanctify Ki Strike feat.

HOLY RADIANCE [EXALTED]

You can increase the intensity of the light surrounding you to

damage undead creatures.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, Nimbus of Light.

Benefit: At will, as a free action, you can empower the radi-

ance surrounding you into a blazing glow that sheds bright light

in a 10-foot radius (and shadowy illumination out to 20 feet).

Undead  within  10  feet  of  you  take  1d4  points  of  damage  per

round they remain within your halo.

HOLY SUBDUAL [EXALTED]

You can turn bonus damage into nonlethal damage.

Prerequisites: Subduing Strike.

Benefit: When  you  use  your  weapon  to  deal  nonlethal

damage,  you  can  also  transform  bonus  damage  from  a  holy

weapon,  your  smite  evil  class  ability,  or  your  smite  granted

power into nonlethal damage.

Special: A  fighter  may  select  Holy  Subdual  as  one  of  his

fighter bonus feats.

INTUITIVE ATTACK [EXALTED]

You fight by faith more than brute strength.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: With  a  simple  weapon  of  your  size  or  a  natural

weapon,  you  may  use  your  Wisdom  modifier  instead  of  your

Strength modifier on attack rolls.

Special: A fighter may select Intuitive Attack as one of his

fighter bonus feats.

KNIGHT OF STARS [EXALTED]

You swear allegiance to the Court of Stars, the paragons of the

eladrin, and in exchange gain power to act on their behalf.

Benefit: Once per day, while performing an act of good, you

may call upon your eladrin patron to gain a +1 luck bonus on

any one roll or check.

Special: Once you take this feat, you may not take it again, nor

can  you  take  either  the  Servant  of  the  Heavens  feat  or  the

Favored of the Companions feat. Your allegiance is only yours to

give once.

Benefit: Choose one of your favored enemies. You can sense the

presence of creatures of this type within 60 feet, as well as pinpoint

their exact location (distance and direction) relative to you. Normal

barriers  and  obstructions  do  not  block  this  supernatural  ability,

allowing  you  to  sense  the  presence  and  location  of  creatures

behind doors or walls, for example. This feat does not allow you to

see an invisible or hidden creature (although you can still discern

its location).

In addition to sensing the presence of your favored enemy,

you deal +1d6 points of damage on weapon attack rolls made

against evil representatives of the favored enemy creature type.

Special: You can choose this feat multiple times. Its effects do

not stack. Each time you select this feat, it applies to a different

favored enemy.

NIMBUS OF LIGHT [EXALTED]

You are cloaked in a radiant light that marks you as a servant of

the purest ideals. All who look upon you know without a doubt

that you are a champion of good and are favored by the powers

of the Upper Planes. The nimbus may take the form of a cloud

surrounding your entire body, or it may appear as beams of light

around your head.

Benefit: Good  creatures  automatically  recognize  the  radi-

ance surrounding you as a sign of your purity and devotion to

the  powers  of  good. You  gain  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on  all

Diplomacy  and  Sense  Motive  checks  made  when  interacting

with good creatures.

Your radiance sheds light as a common lamp: bright light to a

radius  of  5  feet  and  shadowy  illumination  to  10  feet.  You  can

extinguish this radiance at will and reactivate it again as a free

action.

NONLETHAL SUBSTITUTION [METAMAGIC]

You can modify a spell that uses energy to deal damage to deal

nonlethal damage instead.

Prerequisites:  Any  other  metamagic  feat,  Knowledge

(arcana) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  Choose  one  type  of  energy:  acid,  cold,  electricity,

fire, or sonic. You can modify a spell with the chosen designator

to deal nonlethal damage instead of energy damage. The altered

spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage

dealt. For example, a nonlethal fireball spell works in the usual

way  except  it  deals  nonlethal  damage  instead  of  fire  damage.

A nonlethal spell uses a spell slot of the spells normal level,

modified by any other metamagic feats.

NYMPHS KISS [EXALTED]

By maintaining an intimate relationship with a good-aligned fey

(such as a nymph or dryad), you gain some of the characteristics

of fey.

Benefit: Fey creatures regard you as though you were fey. You

gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-related checks,

and a +1 bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like

abilities.  Starting  with  the  level  when  you  take  this  feat,  you

gain 1 extra skill point per level.

NEMESIS [EXALTED]

PURIFY SPELL [METAMAGIC]

You are the holy bane of creatures of a particular type.

Prerequisites: Favored enemy class ability.

You can charge your damaging spells with celestial energy that

leaves good creatures unharmed.

Prerequisites: Any good alignment.

Benefit: A  spell  you  modify  with  this  feat  gains  the  good

descriptor. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, neutral crea-

tures take half damage, or one-quarter with a successful saving

throw (if allowed), while good creatures take no damage at all.

Evil  outsiders  affected  by  the  spell  take  extra  damage:  The

spells damage is increased by one die type (each 1d6 becomes

1d8, each 1d8 becomes 2d6, and so on, using the same progres-

sion  as  weapons  increasing  in  size).  For  example,  a  purified

lightning bolt cast by a 7th-level wizard deals 7d6 points of elec-

tricity  damage  to  evil  creatures,  half  damage  to  neutral  crea-

tures, and no damage at all to good creatures caught in its path.

Evil  outsiders  (except  ones  immune  to  electricity)  take  7d8

points of damage.

A purified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

PURIFY SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

You can charge your damaging spell-like abilities with celestial

energy that leaves good creatures unharmed.

Prerequisites: Any good alignment.

Benefit: This feat adds the good descriptor to a spell-like abil-

ity. Furthermore, if the ability deals damage, neutral creatures

take half damage, or one-quarter with a successful saving throw

(if allowed), while good creatures take no damage at all. Evil out-

siders  affected  by  the  ability  take  extra  damage:  The  abilitys

damage  is  increased  by  one  die  type  (each  1d6  becomes  1d8,

each 1d8 becomes 2d6, and so on, using the same progression as

weapons increasing in size). For example purified lightning bolt

cast by an avoral deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to evil

creatures, half damage to neutral creatures, and no damage at all

to good creatures caught in its path. Evil outsiders (except ones

immune to electricity) take 8d8 points of damage.

Each of your spell-like abilities can be purified three times per

day, though this feat does not allow you to exceed your normal

usage  limit  for  any  ability. Thus,  if  a  tulani  eladrin  chooses  to

purify its chain lightning ability, it can use a purified chain lightning

up to three times that day. Thereafter, it could use its chain light-

ning ability again normally (since it can use chain lightning at will),

or it could purify another of its spell-like abilities, such as meteor

swarm.

PURIFY SPELL TRIGGER [EXALTED]

You can channel holy power through a spell trigger item, such

as a wand or staff.

Prerequisites: Craft  Wand  or  Craft  Staff,  ability  to  turn

undead.

Benefit: When you use a spell trigger item, such as a wand or

staff, you can use one of your turning attempts for the day to

trigger  the  item.  You  still  expend  a  charge  from  the  wand  or

staff. The spell cast by the item is modified as though it had the

Purify Spell feat applied to it.

QUELL THE PROFANE [EXALTED]

Your mightiest attacks weaken evil foes.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Power Attack, Resounding Blow, base

attack bonus +8.

Benefit: Whenever you deal a critical hit to an evil creature

using a melee weapon with which you are proficient, your oppo-

nent must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your char-

acter level + your Cha modifier) or take 1d4+1 points of tempo-

rary Strength damage. A monks unarmed strike is considered a

melee weapon for purposes of this feat.

RANGED SMITE EVIL [EXALTED]

Your  smite  ability  can  be  channeled  through  your  ranged

weapon.

Prerequisites: Smite evil class ability.

Benefit: Your smite evil ability can be channeled through

a  missile that you fire. This counts as one use of your smite

evil ability.

RESOUNDING BLOW [GENERAL]

Your mightiest attacks cause your foes to tremble before you.

Prerequisites: Str  13,  Power  Attack,  Intimidate  7  ranks.

Benefit: Whenever  you  deal  a  critical  hit  using  a  melee

weapon with which you are proficient, your opponent must suc-

ceed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha

modifier) or cower for 1 round. A monks unarmed strike is con-

sidered a melee weapon for purposes of this feat.

Special: A fighter may select Resounding Blow as one of her

fighter bonus feats.

RIGHTEOUS WRATH [EXALTED]

Your rage is empowered with divine fury.

Prerequisites: Rage class ability.

Benefit: When  you  first  deal  damage  with  a  melee  attack

against an evil foe during your rage, that creature must make a suc-

cessful Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your raging class level +

your Cha modifier) or be shaken. If you fail to affect a creature the

first time you hit it, you cannot affect it in that encounter. The

shaken effect remains until you withdraw or are killed or incapac-

itated.

While raging, you maintain clarity of mind unusual among

barbarians. You are perfectly able to deal nonlethal damage, stop

your  attacks  to  show  mercy,  and  distinguish  friend  from  foe

even in the heat of your rage.

SACRED STRIKE [EXALTED]

Your  sneak  attack  is  enhanced  by  your  unshakable  faith  in  a

good-aligned deity.

Prerequisites: Sneak attack class ability.

Benefit: When you use your sneak attack ability against an

evil creature, roll d8s for your sneak attack dice (instead of d6s)

and  your  sneak  attack  damage  is  considered  good-aligned  for

purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

SACRED VOW [EXALTED]

You have willingly given yourself to the service of a good deity

or cause, denying yourself an ordinary life to better serve your

highest ideals.

Benefit: You  gain  a  +2  perfection  bonus  on  Diplomacy

checks.

Special: This feat serves as the prerequisite for several other

feats, including the Vow of Abstinence, Vow of Chastity, Vow of

Nonviolence, Vow of Obedience, Vow of Peace, Vow of Poverty,

and Vow of Purity.

SANCTIFY KI STRIKE [EXALTED]

Sacred power suffuses your unarmed strikes.

Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, Ki strike (lawful),

Special: The +2 increase also applies to the Difficulty Class for

a possessing fiend to Hide from your good spells such as detect evil

or magic circle against evil (as detailed in the Book of Vile Darkness).

Cha 15.

Benefit: Your unarmed strikes deal 1 extra point of damage

to evil creatures, or 1d4 points to evil outsiders and evil undead.

In addition, they are considered good-aligned for purposes of

overcoming damage reduction.

SANCTIFY MARTIAL STRIKE [EXALTED]

Sacred power suffuses your attacks with a certain kind of weapon.

Prerequisites: Cha  15,  Weapon  Focus  with  the  specified

weapon.

Benefit: Whenever you wield a specific kind of weapon, it

deals 1 extra point of damage to evil creatures, or 1d4 points to

evil outsiders and evil undead. In addition, that weapon is con-

sidered  good-aligned  for  purposes  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Special: You can take this feat more than once, selecting a dif-

ferent weapon each time.

SANCTIFY NATURAL ATTACK [EXALTED]

You can focus holy power into your natural attacks.

Prerequisites: One  or  more  natural  weapon  attacks,  base

attack bonus +5.

Benefit: Each  time  you  deal  damage  with  a  natural  attack,

you deal 1 extra point of damage to evil creatures, or 1d4 points

to  evil  outsiders  and  evil  undead.  In  addition,  your  natural

attacks are considered good-aligned for purposes of overcoming

damage reduction.

SANCTIFY WEAPON [EXALTED]

You can focus holy power into your weapon.

Prerequisites: Able to cast align weapon.

Benefit: When  you  cast  align  weapon,  the  affected  weapon

also becomes sanctified. A sanctified weapon deals 1 extra point

of holy damage to evil creatures or 1d4 points of damage to evil

outsiders and evil undead. In addition, creatures with the cor-

rupted template (described in the Book of Vile Darkness) cannot

recover hit point damage dealt by a sanctified weapon by means

of normal healing, including fast healing.

SERVANT OF THE HEAVENS [EXALTED]

You swear allegiance to one of the Tome Archons who rule the

Seven  Heavens,  and  in  exchange  gain  power  to  act  on  their

behalf.

Benefit: Once per day, while performing an act of good, you

may call upon your archon patron to gain a +1 luck bonus on

any one roll or check.

Special: Once you take this feat, you may not take it again,

nor can you take either the Knight of Stars feat or the Favored of

the Companions feat. Your allegiance is only yours to give once.

SPELL FOCUS (GOOD) [GENERAL]

Your  spells  with  the  good  descriptor  are  more  potent  than

normal due to your relationship with the powers of good.

Prerequisites: Any good alignment.

Benefit: Add +2 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws

STIGMATA [EXALTED]

You bear the marks of wounds on your body, as sort of a living

martyrdom.

Prerequisite: Nimbus of Light.

Benefit: You can heal the wounds and ailments of others using

your  own  life  energy.  When  you  activate  this  ability,  as  a  free

action, you immediately take at least 2 points of temporary Con-

stitution damage. You can take as many points of Constitution

damage as you wish, as long as you remain alive and conscious.

Once you have activated your stigmata, you can touch your

allies to heal them of 1 point of damage per level they possess

for every 2 points of Constitution damage you take. In addition,

any  character  you  touch  who  is  suffering  from  a  disease  can

immediately make a new saving throw against that disease with

a sacred bonus equal to the number of points of Constitution

damage  you  took.  If  the  character  succeeds  on  that  saving

throw, she is freed from the disease.

You can use this touch on one ally per point of Constitution

damage  you  take.  As  with  delivering  a  touch  spell,  you  can

touch up to six allies as a full-round action. A single person can

only  benefit  once  from  each  activation  of  your  stigmata,  but

each activation lasts for 1 hour.

For example, if you sacrifice 4 points of Constitution, you

can grant four allies a number of hit points of healing equal to

twice their level. Each ally who was suffering from a disease

would  make  a  new  saving  throw  with  a  +4  sacred  bonus.  If

only two of your allies were wounded at the time you activated

the stigmata, you could save the other two uses for up to 1

hour,  in  case  other  characters  become  wounded  within  that

time. Even if the characters you originally healed were injured

again, however, they could not benefit from the same activa-

tion of your stigmata.

When you use this ability, the wounds on your body bleed in

proportion to the Constitution damage you take. The bleeding

persists  for  1  hour,  and  the  Constitution  damage  cannot  be

restored by any means until the bleeding has stopped. Once the

bleeding has stopped, you can freely activate the stigmata again,

whether  or  not  you  have  recovered  your  lost  Constitution,  as

long as you have enough Constitution left to use the ability and

survive.

SUBDUING STRIKE [GENERAL]

You are adept at striking to deal nonlethal damage even with

normal weapons.

Benefit: You  can  use  any  melee  weapon  to  deal  nonlethal

damage with no penalty on your attack roll. If you are a rogue,

you can deal nonlethal damage with your sneak attack even if

you are using a normal melee weapon. This feat does not allow

you to deal nonlethal damage with ranged weapons.

Normal: If  you  use  a  melee  weapon  designed  to  deal  lethal

damage to deal nonlethal damage instead, you take a 4 penalty on

your attack roll. Rogues normally can only use saps or unarmed

strikes to deal nonlethal damage with their sneak attacks.

Special: A fighter may select Subduing Strike as one of his

against your spells with the good descriptor.

fighter bonus feats.

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/25/03  5:10 PM  Page 47

TOUCH OF GOLDEN ICE [EXALTED]

Your touch is poisonous to evil creatures.

Prerequisites: Con 13.

Benefit: Any evil creature you touch with your bare hand, fist,

or  natural  weapon  is  ravaged  by  golden  ice  (see  Ravages  and

Afflictions in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment for effects).

VOW OF ABSTINENCE [EXALTED]

You  have  taken  a  sacred  vow  to  abstain  from  alcoholic  bever-

ages, drugs, stimulants such as caffeine, and intoxication.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Fortitude

saving throws against poisons and drugs (as long as you are

subjected to a drug unwillingly).

Special: To fulfill your vow, you must not consume

intoxicating, stimulating, depressant, or hallucinogenic

substances,  including  alcohol,  caffeine,

and  other  drugs.  If  you  intentionally

break your vow, you immediately and

irrevocably  lose  the  benefit  of  this

feat. You may not take another feat

to replace it. If you break your vow as

a result of magical compulsion, or oth-

erwise unintentionally (a drug slipped

into your drink, for example), you lose

the benefit of this feat until you perform a

suitable penance and receive an atonement

spell.

VOW OF CHASTITY [EXALTED]

You have taken a sacred vow to refrain from

marriage and sexual intercourse.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You  gain  a  +4  perfection  bonus  on

Will saving throws against charm and phantasm

spells and effects.

Special: To  fulfill  your  vow,  you  must  abstain

from any sexual contact with any other creature. If

you intentionally break your vow, you immedi-

ately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this

feat.  You  may  not  take  another  feat  to

replace  it.  If  you  break  your  vow  as  a

result  of  magical  compulsion,  you  lose

the benefit of this feat until you perform

a  suitable  penance  and  receive  an  atone-

ment spell.

VOW OF NONVIOLENCE

[EXALTED]

You have taken a sacred vow to avoid violence

against humanoids.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: The saving throw DC for spells you cast or other spe-

cial abilities you use against humanoid or monstrous humanoid

targets  is  increased  by  +4  if  the  spell  does  not  deal  damage

(including  ability  damage  but  not  nonlethal  damage),  bestow

negative levels, or cause death. Spells affected by this feat include

most Abjuration, Enchantment, and Illusion spells (though not

phantasmal killer, for example), those few Divination spells that

:

have targets and require saving throws (including detect thoughts

and  discern  lies),  and  even  Necromancy  spells  such  as  waves  of

fatigue and  ray  of  exhaustion. It  does  not  affect  most  Evocation,

Conjuration, and Transmutation spells.

The bonus granted by this feat does not stack with the bonus

granted by the Spell Focus feat. It affects only saving throw DCs,

not caster level checks or other elements of a spell.

The benefit of this feat extends to special abilities other than

spells that allow a saving throw, but only if the ability does not

deal  damage  and  is  not  dependent  on  dealing  damage.  For

example, a character with the Stunning Fist feat can increase the

saving throw DC to avoid being stunned by +4 if she deals

nonlethal  damage,  rather  than  regular  damage,  with

her  stunning  attack.  A  couatls  venom  would  not

become more virulent because of this feat, however,

because it deals ability damage and requires

the  couatl  to  deal  hit  point  damage  in

order to deliver it.

Special: To  fulfill  your  vow,  you  must

not cause harm or suffering to humanoid

or  monstrous  humanoid  foes.  You  may

not deal real damage or ability damage to

such  foes  through  spells  or  weapons,

though  you  may  deal  nonlethal  damage.

You  may  not  target  them  with  death

effects,  disintegrate, pain  effects,  or

other spells that have the immediate

potential to cause death, suffering,

or great harm.

Your purity is so great that any

ally of yours who slays a helpless

or defenseless foe within 120 feet

of  you  feels  great  remorse.  Your

ally takes a 1 morale penalty on his

attack rolls for 1 hour per your charac-

ter level. For each helpless foe slain, the

attack penalty increases by 1, to a maxi-

mum  equal  to  your  character  level.  The

duration of the increased penalty starts from

the latest slaying.

You may ask your allies to give you an

oath  that  a  helpless  foe  will  not  be

slain. If the oath is sworn, an ally who

later  breaks  the  oath  takes  the

penalty for doing so as if you

were  present.  If  you  leave  a

helpless  foe  to  be  killed  by

your  allies,  you  have  broken

your  vow.  You  may  ask  a  de-

feated  creature  to  give  you  an

oath  of  surrender  or  noninterference

in exchange for its life. If the creature breaks this oath

to you, you can allow your allies to deal with the creature as they

see fit without breaking their oaths or your vow of nonviolence.

If  you  intentionally  break  your  vow,  you  immediately  and

irrevocably  lose  the  benefit  of  this  feat.  You  may  not  take

another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of

magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you

perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.

VOW OF OBEDIENCE [EXALTED]

VOW OF POVERTY [EXALTED]

You have taken a sacred vow to live according to the dictates of

another, generally your superior in a religious order or similar

organization.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You  gain  a  +4  perfection  bonus  on  Will  saving

throws against compulsion spells and effects.

Special: To fulfill your vow, you must unquestioningly obey

your superior and live according to the rules of your organiza-

tion. If you intentionally break your vow, you immediately and

irrevocably  lose  the  benefit  of  this  feat.  You  may  not  take

another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of

magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you

perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.

VOW OF PEACE [EXALTED]

You have taken a sacred vow to abstain from harming any living

creature.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow, Vow of Nonviolence.

Benefit: This  sacred  vow  grants  significant  supernatural

benefits, but its cost is high.

First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a

radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a suc-

cessful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your

Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Crea-

tures  who  leave  the  aura  and  reenter  it  receive  new  saving

throws.  A  creature  that  makes  a  successful  saving  throw  and

remains  in  the  aura  is  unaffected  until  it  leaves  the  aura  and

reenters. The aura is a mind-affecting, supernatural compulsion.

Second, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus to your AC, a +2

deflection bonus to your AC, and a +2 exalted bonus to your AC.

This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not

hinder  incorporeal  touch  attacks.  Brilliant  energy  weapons,

however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus.

If  you  also  have  the  Vow  of  Poverty  feat,  the  natural  armor,

deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat

all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured

weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Forti-

tude  save  (DC  10  +  one-half  your  character  level  +  your  Con

modifier)  or  shatter  against  your  skin,  leaving  you  unharmed.

Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks.

Special: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm to any

living creature (constructs and undead are not included in this

prohibition). You may not deal real damage or ability damage to

such creatures through spells or weapons, though you may deal

nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects,

disintegrate, or other spells that have the immediate potential to

cause death or great harm. You also may not use nondamaging

spells to incapacitate or weaken living foes so that your allies can

kill themif you incapacitate a foe, you must take him prisoner.

If  you  intentionally  break  your  vow,  you  immediately  and

irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another

feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical com-

pulsion or otherwise unwittingly, you lose the benefit of this feat

until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement

spell. (Characters who have taken a Vow of Peace are known to

drink water through a strainer in order to avoid accidentally swal-

lowing, and thereby causing harm to, a small insect.)

You have taken a sacred vow to forswear material possessions.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You gain bonuses to your Armor Class, ability scores,

and saving throws, as well as bonus exalted feats, all depending on

your character level. See Voluntary Poverty in Chapter 2 for details.

Special: To  fulfill  your  vow,  you  must  not  own  or  use  any

material  possessions,  with  the  following  exceptions: You  may

carry and use ordinary (neither magic nor masterwork) simple

weapons,  usually  just  a  quarterstaff  that  serves  as  a  walking

stick.  You  may  wear  simple  clothes  (usually  just  a  homespun

robe, possibly also including a hat and sandals) with no magical

properties. You may carry enough food to sustain you for one

day in a simple (nonmagic) sack or bag. You may carry and use a

spell component pouch. You may not use any magic item of any

sort,  though  you  can  benefit  from  magic  items  used  on  your

behalfyou  can  drink  a  potion  of  cure  serious  wounds a  friend

gives you, receive a spell cast from a wand, scroll, or staff, or ride

on your companions ebony fly. You may not, however, borrow a

cloak of resistance or any other magic item from a companion for

even a single round, nor may you yourself cast a spell from a

scroll, wand, or staff.

If you break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose

the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it.

VOW OF PURITY [EXALTED]

You have taken a sacred vow to avoid contact with dead flesh.

Prerequisites: Sacred Vow.

Benefit: You gain a +4 perfection bonus on Fortitude saving

throws to resist disease and death effects.

Special: To fulfill your vow, you must avoid all contact with

dead  creatures,  including  meat  cooked  for  food.  You  may  not

touch  fallen  foes. You  may  fight  undead  foes,  but  must  purify

yourself as soon as possible afterward. You may touch dead char-

acters in order to restore them to life (by way of a raise dead or

similar spell that requires you to touch the corpse), but for no

other purpose.

If you fight undead creatures or accidentally touch dead flesh,

you must purify yourself in a special ritual that requires 1 hour

and a flask of holy water.

If  you  intentionally  break  your  vow,  you  immediately  and

irrevocably  lose  the  benefit  of  this  feat.  You  may  not  take

another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of

magical compulsion, you lose the benefit of this feat until you

perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.

WORDS OF CREATION [EXALTED]

You have learned a few of the words that were spoken to create

the world.

Prerequisites: Int 15, Cha 15, base Will save bonus +5.

Benefit: You  can  use  the  Words  of  Creation  to  enhance

bardic  music,  to  help  cast  good  spells  and  create  good  magic

items, and to enhance the process of creation (see Words of Cre-

ation in Chapter 2).

Normal: A nonevil creature that tries to utter the Words of

Creation without learning them properly is affected as by a fee-

blemind spell, while an evil character is struck dead. Fortunately,

it is impossible to make someone speak the Words of Creation

against  his  will,  because  their  pronunciation  is  so  exacting.

here  are  prestige  classes,  and  then  there  are  prestige

classes. Members of the prestige classes detailed in this

chapter may well be among the most prestigious charac-

ters in any campaign world. Devotees of holy orders dedi-

cated to and sponsored by the celestial paragons who rule

the upper planes, they are heroes whose devotion to the cause of

righteousness knows no bounds. They are exalted in every sense

of the word: noble and virtuous, elevated and prestigious.

The  prestige  classes  in  this  chapter  have  steep  entrance

requirements.  Only  characters  of  good  alignment  who  have

earned  one  or  more  exalted  feats  may  gain  entry.  All  of  the

prestige classes share the high moral standards of the paladin

(though not all require characters to be lawful goodneutral

good  and  chaotic  good  characters  are  no  less  virtuous),  and

characters risk losing access to their class abilities if they fall

short  of  their  high  calling. The  costs  carry  benefits,  though.

The  stringent  demands  provide  commensurately  great

rewards.

The  following  text  applies  to  every  prestige  class  in  this

chapter:

A character who ceases to be of good alignment or who will-

fully  commits  an  evil  act  loses  all  special  abilities  and  spells

acquired in this prestige class, and may not gain new levels in

that class. She may regain her abilities if she atones for her vio-

lations (see Sin and Atonement in Chapter 1).

ANOINTED KNIGHT

The anointed knight is a holy soldier who has taken great

pains  to  learn  the  intricacies  of  alchemy  in  order  to

become  a  more  capable  combatant.  Armed  with  an

ancestral  weapon,  she  searches  for  obscure  lore,  con-

sults  with  alchemists  and  sages,  and  communes  with

the  powers  of  good.  Her  unquenchable  thirst  for

knowledge  is  matched  only  by  her  extraordinary

combat prowess.

An  anointed  knight  crafts  and  draws  power  from

magically created oils. By anointing herself with these

oils, she unlocks new supernatural powers within her

being. She also coats her ancestral weapon with spe-

cial  oils  that  bestow  additional  qualities  upon  the

weapon.

Anointed knights are typically paladins or fight-

ers with one or more wizard or cleric levels. Occa-

sionally,  an  anointed  knight  emerges  from  the

ranks of single-class wizards, sorcerers, clerics, or

bards.

Regardless  of  their  backgrounds,  anointed

knights  often  form  bonds  of  friendship  with

knowledgeable  arcane  spellcasters  who  might

benefit  from  their  combat  puissance.  Anointed

knights  also  ally  themselves  with  angels,  eladrins,

and other forces of good. They believe in crusades

against evil and enjoy taking the fight to evildoers

wherever they may reside. They oppose the warriors of darkness

(as described in the Book of Vile Darkness), and the

one trait they share with their evil counterparts

is  a  lack  of  subtlety.  An  anointed  knight

would  much  rather  go  head-to-head  with

her  enemies  than  work  behind  the

scenes or try to organize any form

of passive resistance.

APOSTLE OF PEACE

In a world where conflict usually means violence, where good

and evil meet regularly on the field of battle, where might too

often  makes  right  and  power  is  measured  in  gold  peaces,  the

apostle of peace is a lone voice crying in the wilderness, calling

for a change of heart. Having completely forsworn violence in

any form, the apostle of peace is an advocate for nonviolent res-

olution of conflict. He is a powerful font of divine magic, but his

spells are all aimed toward healing, calming hostility, and aiding

his allies.

Members  of  all  classes  can  qualify  to  become  apostles  of

peace,  though  barbarians,  fighters,  and  rogues  have  difficulty

meeting  the  skill  prerequisites  and  are  usually  too  oriented

toward  martial  exploits  to  be  interested.  Clerics,  bards,  and

druids  often  develop  pacifistic  philosophies  and  gravitate

toward this class, but any character can experience a conversion

of sorts and become an apostle of peace.

Apostles of peace are usually solitary wanderers or even her-

mits. Many nonplayer character (NPC) apostles are far removed

from the violent struggles of the adventuring life, but may serve

as  resources  of  knowledge,  spells,  or  spiritual  guidance  for

adventuring  PCs.  Apostle  of  peace  PCs  are  unusual  but  not

impossible;  see  Waging  Peace  in  Chapter  2  for  advice  about

using such characters in the game.

Hit Die: d4.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  apostle  of  peace

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Apostles of peace gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the

use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect

them (such as a ring of protection or bracers of armor). An apostle of

peace  who  wears  any  armor  is  unable  to  cast  apostle  of

peace spells or use any of his supernatural

class abilities while doing so and for 24

hours thereafter.

Spells: An  apostle  of  peace  has  the  ability  to

cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle

of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom

score of at least 10 + the spells level, so an apos-

tle  with  a Wisdom  of  10  or  lower  cannot  cast

these  spells.  Apostle  of  peace  bonus  spells  are

based  on  Wisdom,  and  saving

throws against these spells have a

DC  of  10  +  spell  level  +  the

apostle  of  peaces  Wisdom

modifier. When the apostle of

peace gets 0 spells per day of a

given  spell  level  (for  instance,

2nd-level  spells  for  a  2nd-level

apostle),  he  gains

only  the  bonus

spells he would

be  entitled  to

based  on  his

Wisdom score for

that spell level. The

apostle  of  peaces  spell  list  appears  below.  An

apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a

cleric does.

To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace,

add the characters apostle levels to one-half of his caster

levels in other spellcasting classes.

Spontaneous  Casting: An  apostle  of

peace can channel stored spell energy

into healing spells that the apostle did

not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can

lose  any  prepared  apostle  spell  in

order  to  cast  any  cure spell  of  the

same spell level or lower (a cure spell

is any spell with cure in its name).

using  his  character  level  as  his  caster  level,  to  dispel  certain

mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch

can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target,

such as fear or rage.

Censure Fiends (Su): A 4rd-level apostle of peace can cen-

sure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy

power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils,

and  other  outsiders  with  the  evil  subtype  recoil.  Make  a

Charisma check for the apostle and consult

Table 89 in the Players Handbook,

using the apostles character

level  to  determine  the  most

powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6

+    the  apostle  of  peaces  level  +  his  Charisma

modifier  for  censuring  damage.  Using  both

the apostles character level and his class level

in this manner means that he is more likely to

affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to

censure more than one of them.

A censured fiend is stunned by the apos-

tles holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apos-

tle  of  peace  attacks  a  censured  fiend,  the

stunning  ends  immediately  and  the  fiend

can act normally on its next turn.

If the apostle of peaces character level is

at  least  twice  the  fiends  Hit  Dice,  he  ban-

ishes  the  affected  fiend  back  to  its  home

plane.  An  apostle  of  peace  can  make  a  number  of

censuring  attempts  per  day  equal  to  3  +  his

Charisma  modi-

fier.  These  at-

tempts are separate from any attempts to

turn undead.

Apostle of Peace Spell List

Apostles  of  peace  choose  their  spells  from

the following list:

0 Level: create water, cure minor wounds, detect

magic, detect poison, guidance, light, mending,

purify  food  and  drink,  read  magic,  resist-

ance, virtue.

1st  Level:  bless,  bless  water,  command,  com-

prehend  languages,  cure  light  wounds,

detect evil, detect undead, endure ele-

ments,  entropic  shield,  eyes  of  the

avoral*,  invisibility  to  undead,

obscuring  mist,  protection  from

evil, ray of hope*, remove fear, sanctuary, shield of faith, vision

of heaven*.

An apostle of peace

Turn  Undead  (Su): An  apostle  of  peace  can  turn

undead  as  a  good  cleric  of  his  apostle  of  peace  level

would. If he is also a cleric (or paladin), he adds his apostle levels

to his effective cleric levels to determine his turning capability.

Pacifying Touch (Su): At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains

the  ability  to  pacify  hostile  or  angry  creatures  by  touch. The

effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect

only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch

the  target.  A  touched  creature  receives  no  saving  throw  and

spell  resistance  does  not  apply. The  pacifying  touch  does  not

suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The

apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic,

2nd  Level:  aid,  augury,  bears  endurance,  calm  emotions,  conse-

crate, cure moderate wounds, delay poison, eagles splendor, ease pain*,

enthrall,  glorious  apparel*,  lesser  restoration,  make  whole,  owls

wisdom, remove paralysis, resist energy, shield other, silence, status, yoke

of mercy*, zone of truth.

3rd  Level:  blessed  sight*,  create  food  and  water,  cure  serious

wounds,  dispel  magic,  helping  hand,  invisibility  purge,  magic  circle

against evil, magic vestment, meld into stone, prayer, protection from

energy, refreshment*, remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, remove

disease,  remove  nausea*,  water  breathing,  water  walk,  wind  wall.

A beloved

of Valarian

BELOVED OF

VALARIAN

The  beloved  of  Valarian  (also

called  Valarians  beloved)  are

women who have foresworn

the love of mortals to dedicate

themselves  entirely  to

the unicorn deity Valarian,

thus fostering a close bond

with unicorns. They normally

come  from  the  ranks  of

exalted  rangers  or  druids,

although  there  have

been paladins and even fight-

ers who have chosen this path.

Most of Valarians beloved are humans,

elves, and half-elves, but halflings, gnomes, and dwarves are not

prohibited.

A beloved of Valarian is a solitary being, shunning civilization.

She retreats to the woods where she maintains few contacts with

the outside world. Because she champions the cause of good, she

calls upon their animal allies to help repel invaders should evil

invade  her  forest  refuge.  Her  relationship  with  the  unicorn  is

nothing less than a partnership forged in light. She has a closer

emotional bond to her mount than she does with her own family

members. Just as she relies on the unicorn, the unicorn relies on

her to help keep its mysteries safe.

All  of Valarians  beloved  must  be  chaste  and  must  dedicate

herself  wholly  both  to  good  and  her  unicorn  companion.

Should a beloved of Valarian ever willingly couple with a

mortal, the unicorn leaves her company without hard

feelings or regret. Because of

the  solitary  existence

these  women  must

endure,  it  is  rare  (but

not unheard of ) for Valar-

ians beloved to join ranks with

others. They  prefer  the  com-

panionship  of  paladins  but

associate with any good char-

acters during times of trouble.

Under  no  circumstances  will

one  of  Valarians  beloved  agree  to

join with an evil character, and she

barely  tolerates  neutral  characters.

The  beloved  of  Valarian  and  their

unicorn companions may leave

their forest sanctuaries should

they  be  needed  to  fight  evil.

aid an animal, she does not meet her unicorn companion and

cannot advance in this class.

Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Knowledge  (nature)  (Int),  Ride

All of the following are class features of the beloved of Valarian

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A beloved of Valarian is

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and

small shields.

Spells: A beloved of Valarian has the ability to cast a small

number of divine spells. To cast a beloved of Valarian spell, the

beloved  must  have  a Wisdom  score  of  at  least  10  +  the  spells

level,  so  a  beloved  of  Valarian  with  a  Wisdom  of  10  or  lower

cannot  cast  these  spells.  Beloved  of  Valarian  bonus  spells  are

based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a

DC of 10 + spell level + the beloveds Wisdom modifier. When

the beloved of Valarian gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for

instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level beloved of Valarian), she

gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her

Wisdom score for that spell level.

The beloved of Valarians spell list appears below. A beloved of

Valarian prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a

beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Call Unicorn (Su): A beloved of Valarian can call a unicorn

to her side. See the Monster Manual for the unicorns statistics.

The  unicorn  appears  instantly  and  serves  the  character  for

life, provided she remains chaste and of good alignment. The

unicorn  may  be  dismissed  at  any  time,  although  a  character

cannot  call  another  until  she  gains  a  level  in  the  beloved  of

Valarian  class.  If  the  unicorn  should  die  before  its  rider,  the

character may call another unicorn companion when she gains

a new level in this class.

A  beloved  of  Valarian  can  have  no  more  than  one  unicorn

companion at any given time.

A beloved of Valarian can assign her unicorn companion to

undertake  different  types  of  tasks.  Particularly  useful  as  a

mount, the unicorn typically will not undergo a quest or other-

wise take on complex burdens without the supervision of the

beloved of Valarian.

Telepathic Bond (Su): A beloved of Valarian can communi-

cate  telepathically  with  her  unicorn  companion.  This  bond

remains in effect unless the character is separated from her uni-

corn by a number of miles equal to 100 + the beloveds character

level.

At 6th level, a Valarians beloved can communicate telepathi-

cally with any animal native to her unicorn companions home

forest.

54

Timelessness  (Su): Unicorns  age  very  slowly,  living  for

thousands of years. As long as she remains faithful to Valarian

and has a unicorn companion serving her, a beloved of Valarian

ages just as slowly, the aging process essentially halted.

Ethereal Jaunt (Sp): At 2nd level, once per day, a beloved of

Valarian and her equipment may become ethereal, as the ethereal

jaunt spell cast by a sorcerer of the beloveds character level. If

the beloved of Valarian is astride her unicorn companion, it is

also affected by this ability. However, if the beloved of Valarian

dismounts or the two otherwise become separated before the

ethereal jaunt expires, the unicorn companion instantly returns

to the Material Plane.

Forest Dweller (Ex): Time spent in the forest alters a beloved

of Valarians physiology at 3rd level. She gains a +2 racial bonus

on Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): Starting  at  4th  level,  a  beloved  of

Valarian can react to danger before her senses would normally

allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even

when caught flat-footed.

If the beloved of Valarian already has uncanny dodge from a

different  class  (rogue,  for  example),  she  gains  improved

uncanny  dodge  instead;  she  cannot  be  flanked  except  by  a

rogue who has at least four more rogue levels than she has in

this prestige class.

As long as the beloved of Valarian is riding her unicorn com-

panion, it gains the benefit of this ability as well.

Call Celestial Charger (Su): At 6th level, a beloved of Valarian

can call a celestial unicornalso known as a celestial charger

to her side. See the Unicorn entry in the Monster Manual for the

celestial chargers statistics. If the beloved of Valarian already has

a  unicorn  companion,  Valarian  transforms  it  into  a  celestial

charger instead of sending his beloved a new companion.

Natures  Understanding  (Ex): At  7th  level,  a  beloved  of

Valarian  gains  a  +2  insight  bonus  on  Handle  Animal,  Knowl-

edge (nature), and Survival checks.

Holy Smite (Sp): Starting at 8th level, once per day, a beloved

of Valarian can cast holy smite as a cleric of her class level. She

may choose to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage

with the holy smite.

Wood  Repulsion  (Su): Weapons  partially  or  wholly  fash-

ioned from wood have a harder time striking a beloved of Valar-

ian, as though deflected by some invisible barrier. Attacks made

with such weapons take a 2 penalty. As long as the beloved of

Valarian is riding her unicorn companion, it gains the benefit of

this ability as well.

Mass  Baleful  Polymorph  (Sp): At  10th  level,  once  per  day,  a

beloved of Valarian can cast a special version of the baleful poly-

morph spell that affects all evil creatures within 30 feet of her (as

a  10th-level  druid).  Affected  creatures  are  transformed  into

harmless Diminutive mammals (rabbits, squirrels, or the like) or

Fine vermin (nonthreatening spiders, centipedes, or the like).

All  affected  creatures  are  transformed  into  the  same  type  of

creature.  See  the  baleful  polymorph spell  description  in  the

Players Handbook for details.

BELOVED OF VALARIAN SPELL LIST

Valarians  beloved  choose  their  spells  from  the  following  list:

1st level: calm animals, charm animal, cure light wounds, delay

poison, detect poison, detect snares and pits, entangle, eyes of the avoral*,

book.

CELESTIAL MYSTIC

The mysteries of the seventh mounting

heaven, the celestial layer of Chronias,

are unplumbed even by the archons

who  inhabit  Celestias  lower

layers.  Tales  say  that  those  who

enter  have  their  inherent  good-

ness  magnified  until  their  es-

sence  joins  with  Celestia  itself.

From their homes and studies on

the Material Plane, celestial mystics

strive  to  attain  this  ultimate  unity

with  the  perfect  good.  By  contemplat-

ing the mystery of the Illuminated Heaven,

they believe that they become more pure,

more  good,  and  more  perfect.  As  they

The  path  of  the  celestial  mystic  is

esoteric and mysterious, and appeals

most  commonly  to  wizards  and

other characters with an academic inter-

est in the planes, particularly the upper planes,

their  denizens,  and  the  fabric  of  reality  itself.

Clerics, sorcerers, and monks are often drawn to

the class as well. Barbarians, druids, fighters, rangers,

A celestial mystic

and rogues rarely have the interest or discipline to follow the

demanding contemplative path of the celestial mystic.

Celestial mystics are often loners, poring over cryptic manu-

scripts  and  practicing  their  meditative  techniques.  However,

they have a strong ethic of involvement in the world even as

they seek to transform it, and strive to live out their increasing

goodness by helping the weak and helpless. Thus, they are often

found  as  part  of  adventuring  groups  (made  up  of  similarly

high-minded individuals) or otherwise actively involved in

fighting evil or promoting good.

saving throws against disease, poison, and petrification. In addi-

tion, a magic circle against evil effect always surrounds the mystic,

identical with the spell cast by a cleric whose level equals the

celestial mystics character level.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd level, and each level

thereafter,  a  celestial  mystic  gains  new  spells  per  day  (and

spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a

spellcasting  class  he  belonged  to  before  adding  the  prestige

class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character

of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning

or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so

on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a

character had more than one spellcasting class before becom-

ing a celestial mystic, he must decide to which class he adds

the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Celestial  Spells:  Once  he  reaches  2nd  level,  a  celestial

mystic  can  cast  spells  as  if  he  were  an  archon.  Specifically,

the mystic can cast any spell described in Chapter 6 that has

a celestial or archon component, as long as he can otherwise

cast  the  spell  (it  appears  on  his  spell  list,  it  is  of  a  level  of

spells that he can cast, and he has a sufficient ability score to

cast spells of that level). He does not gain any other celestial

qualities.  For  instance,  he  is  not  immune  to  the  blast  of  a

trumpet archon.

Blessing of the Golden Heaven (Su): A celestial mystic of

3rd level or higher is immune to death spells and magical death

effects.

Blessing  of  the  Pearly  Heaven  (Su): A  5th-level  celestial

mystic  retains  his  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC  regardless  of  being

caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. In addition,

a celestial mystic may make a mystical knowledge check with a

bonus equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier to see

whether he knows some relevant information about legendary

people, places, or items. If he has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge

(history),  he  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  this  check.  Otherwise  this

works as a bardic knowledge check.

Blessing of the Crystal Heaven (Su): At 7th level, a celestial

mystic can cure his own wounds. He can cure up to three times

his class level in hit points each day, and he can spread this heal-

ing out among several uses. In addition, he gains immunity to

disease  and  poison,  and  a  +2  sacred  bonus  on  saving  throws

against Enchantment spells and effects.

Blessing of the Platinum Heaven (Su): At 8th level, a celes-

tial mystic gains the ability to channel spell energy into a bolt of

holy power. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range

(400 ft. + 40 ft./class level) and deals 4d6 points of damage plus

1d6 points of damage per level of the spell channeled to create

the effect. For example, a celestial mystic who channels a 7th-

level spell into holy power deals 11d6 points of damage to the

target if the bolt hits.

Blessing  of  the  Glittering  Heaven  (Su): At  9th  level,  a

celestial mystic gains spell resistance 20 and damage reduction

10/unholy.

Blessing  of  the  Illuminated  Heaven  (Su): A  10th-level

celestial mystic is surrounded by an aura of positive energy to a

radius of 10 feet. Within that emanation, life flourishes: colors

are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations

are more intense. (This effect is purely sensory; game effects

such  as  energy  damage  are  not  affected.)  All  living  creatures

within the aura, including the celestial mystic, gain fast healing

2 as an extraordinary ability as long as they remain there. No

undead creature with fewer than 10 HD can enter the aura, and

those brought into it act as if they had been turned. Undead

with 10 HD or more can enter the aura unharmed, but they do

not gain fast healing.

CHAMPION

OF GWYNHARWYF

Gwynharwyf is the celestial patron of barbarians, the model for

how rage and righteousness can coexist in a single being. Her

champions are mortal barbarians who strive to emulate her sub-

lime  balance  of  fury  and  reserve,  using  their  rage  to  smite

implacably evil foes while retaining their focus on good, with its

demands  for  mercy  and  respect  for  life. They  are  among  the

fiercest  warriors  for  the  cause  of  good  on  the  Material  Plane,

armed  with  spells  they  can  actually  cast  while  raging,  iron-

willed resistance to compulsions, and eladrinlike resistance to

attacks in addition to their fearsome rage.

Champions of Gwynharwyf must have at least one level of

barbarian in order to meet the requirements to enter the class,

and most champions are single-classed barbarians. Sometimes,

a fighter/barbarian or ranger/barbarian becomes a champion of

Gwynharwyf,  but  members  of  other  classes  do  not  usually

pursue this course.

Most champions of Gwynharwyf are wandering adventurers

of some sort. Some are guerilla fighters in evil kingdoms, work-

ing to overthrow tyrants and liberate oppressed peoples. Others

are dungeon delvers, seeking to exterminate monstrous aberra-

tions and vile creations from the face of the earth. Still others

stalk city streets, sniffing out diabolical cults and their evil mas-

ters.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a champion of Gwynharwyf, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Chaotic good.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival

(Wis), and Swim (Str). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for

skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the champion of Gwyn-

harwyf prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Champions of Gwynhar-

wyf gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

small number of divine spells. To cast a champion of Gwynhar-

+  the  spells  level,  so  a  champion  of  Gwynharwyf

with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these

spells. Champion of Gwynharwyf bonus spells

are  based  on  Wisdom,  and  saving  throws

against  these  spells  have  a  DC  of  10  +  spell

level + the champions Wisdom modifier.

When the champion gets 0 spells of a

given spell level (for instance, 1st-level

spells  for  a  1st  level  champion  of

Gwynharwyf ), she gets only the

bonus  spells  she  would  be

entitled to based on her

Wisdom score for that

spell level.

The  champion  of

Gwynharwyf s  spell

list appears below. A

champion  of  Gwynharwyf

prepares and casts spells just

as  a  cleric  does  (though  a

champion  cannot

neously  cast  cure spells).

Detect  Evil (Sp): At  will,  a

sponta-

champion  of  Gwynharwyf  can  use

detect evil, as the spell. She can use this

ability even while raging.

Rage (Ex): A champion of Gwynharwyf adds her

class  levels  to  her  barbarian  levels  to  determine

how often she can rage and when she gains the

greater rage, tireless rage, and mighty rage bar-

barian  class  abilities.  She  does  not  gain  or

improve any other barbarian class abilities.

(Su):

Smite  Evil

Once  per  day,  a  cham-

pion  of  Gwynharwyf

may  attempt  to  smite

evil  with  one  normal

melee  attack.  She  adds  her

Charisma  bonus  to  her  attack  roll  and  deals  1  extra  point  of

damage per champion of Gwynharwyf level. If she accidentally

smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect but the

ability is still used up for that day.

A  5th-level  champion  of  Gwynharwyf  can  smite  evil  twice

per day. At 9th level, she can use this ability three times per day.

Divine  Grace  (Su): A  2nd-level  champion  of  Gwynharwyf

gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on all saving throws.

A champion of

Gwynharwyf

Furious Casting (Ex): Starting

at  2nd  level,  a  champion  of  Gwyn-

harwyf  can  cast  her  champion  spells

even  while  raging.  If  she  has  another

spellcasting  class,  she  cannot  cast  spells

from that class while raging, only the spells

that  she  gains  from  her  champion  levels.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex): Starting

at  3rd  level,  a  champion  of  Gwynhar-

wyf gains the ability to shrug off some amount

of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 2

from  the  damage  the  champion  takes  each  time

she  is  dealt  damage  from  a  weapon  or  natural

attack. At 6th level, and every 2 levels thereafter,

this  damage  reduction  rises  by  1  point.  Damage

reduction  can  reduce  damage  to  0  but  not  below  0.

Resist Enchantment (Su): At 3rd level, a champion of

Gwynharwyf  gains  a  +2  morale  bonus  on  all  saving

throws against Enchantment spells or effects.

Fearsome Fury (Su): At 4th level, a champion of

Gwynharwyf  can  strike  terror  into  the  hearts  of  her

foes  while  she  rages.  When  she  enters  a  rage,  she

makes  an  Intimidate  check.  Any  enemy  that  comes

within 30 feet of her while she is raging must make a Will

save against a DC equal to her Intimidate check result. Those

who fail become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds or the duration of

the rage, whichever is longer.

Energy  Resistance  (Su): At  5th  level,  a  champion  of

Gwynharwyf grows closer to her eladrin patrons, gaining

acid,  cold,  and  electricity  resistance  5.  This  resistance

increases to 10 at 10th level.

Immune  to  Charm  and  Compul-

sion  (Ex): A  7th-level  champion  of

Gwynharwyf  is  completely  immune  to  charm  and

compulsion spells.

CHAMPION OF GWYNHARWYF SPELL LIST

Champions  of  Gwynharwyf  choose  their  spells  from  the  fol-

lowing list:

1st  Level:  bless,  bless  weapon,  cure  light  wounds,  detect  poison,

detect  undead,  divine  favor,  divine  sacrifice*,  endure  elements,  lesser

DEFENDER OF SEALTIEL

Sealtiel  is  the  celestial  paragon  who  serves  as  patron  of

defendersthose who protect the weak from the depredations

of the strong, fight off the forces of evil when they assault the

good,  and  defend  the  ideals  of  goodness  and  truth

from  evil  deception  and  lies.  His  mortal

champions are the defenders of Sealtiel,

a knightly order sworn to uphold those

ideals. While the fists of Raziel take the

fight  against  evil  onto  evils  home  ground,

the  defenders  of  Sealtiel  remain  at  home,

guarding against evils counterassault.

Most  defenders  of  Sealtiel  are  paladins,

fighters,  and  rangers.  Occasionally  clerics  or

monks  (often  multiclass  cleric/fighters  or  the

like) adopt the class as well, and even more

rarely, fighter/rogues take up Sealtiels

cause.  Arcane  spellcasters  rarely

find the class appealing.

The wandering life of an adventurer does

not  easily  suit  most  defenders  of  Sealtiel,

who  prefer  to  stay  in  civilized  regions  to

protect  people.  Sometimes,  however,  a

defender of Sealtiel takes on the role of

a bodyguard for an important or holy

person, and travels with that person

wherever  necessity  leads.  Player

character defenders could easily fall

into  that  category,  or  feature

prominently  in  a  campaign

that  revolved  around  the

defense  of  a  city  or  citadel.

NPC  defenders  are  usually

found in sedentary roles such as

these.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the defender of Sealtiel

prestige class.

Glory of the Martyr (Sp): An 8th-level defender of Sealtiel can

use glory of the martyr*, as the spell, once per day. His effective

caster level is his defender level.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Defenders of Sealtiel gain

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Defensive  Stance  (Ex): When  he  needs  to,  a  defender  of

Sealtiel  can  become  a  stalwart  bastion  of  defense.  In  this  de-

fensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and dura-

bility, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He

gains  +2  to  Strength,  +4  to  Constitution,  a  +2  resistance

bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.

The increase in Constitution increases the defender

of Sealtiels hit points by 2 points per level, but these

hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance

when  the  Constitution  score  drops  back  4  points.

These extra hit points are not lost first the way tempo-

rary  hit  points  are.  While  in  a  defensive  stance,  a

defender cannot use skills or abilities that would

require  him  to  shift  his  position,  such  as

Move  Silently  or  Jump.  A  defensive

stance lasts for a number of rounds equal

to 3 + the characters (newly improved)

Constitution modifier. A defender may

end  his  defensive  stance  voluntarily

prior to this limit. At the end of the

defensive  stance,  the  defender  is

winded and takes a 2 penalty to

Strength  for  the  duration  of  that

encounter.  A  defender  can  only

use  his  defensive  stance  a  certain

number  of  times  per  day  as  deter-

mined by his level. Using the defen-

sive  stance  takes  no  time  itself,  but  a

defender  can  only  do  so  during  his

action.  (A  defender  cant,  for  example,

use the stance when struck down by an

arrow in order to get the extra hit points

from the increased Constitution.)

Shield  of  Faith (Sp): A  defender  of

Sealtiel  can  use  shield  of  faith,  as  the

spell, three times per day. His effective

caster level is his defender level.

Magic  Circle  (Su): A  defender  of

Sealtiel who is 2nd level or higher is con-

stantly  surrounded  by  an  effect  that

duplicates the magic circle against evil spell

as cast by a cleric of his defender level.

Shield Other (Sp): A 2nd-level defender of Sealtiel

EMISSARY OF BARACHIEL

Ruler of the first heaven of Celestia, Barachiel is patron of lawful

good heralds and messengers. He is charged with the defense of

Celestia  and  the  promulgation  of  law  and  goodness  on  the

Material Plane, and his emissaries help him carry out this

latter  mission.  The  emissaries  of  Barachiel  are  peace-

makers,  diplomats,  and  evangelists,  as  well  as  staunch

opponents of evil and corruption.

Emissaries of Barachiel are often clerics, paladins, or

even rogues, but members of almost every other class

sometimes take up Barachiels mission as well.

Centers  of  population  are  the  natural  habitat  of

most  emissaries  of  Barachiel,  whose  primary

purpose involves encouraging people toward

lawful  good  behavior.  Some  emissaries,

however,  gravitate  toward  real  challenges:

preaching  Barachiels  cause  among  tradi-

tionally  hostile  or  evil  humanoids,  from

lizardfolk  to  orcs.  The  fact  that  some  of

these  emissaries  even  survive  is  testa-

ment  to  their  power  and  conviction.

While few emissaries have the fortitude

to work for long among evil humanoids,

many  others  make  shorter  forays  into

hostile territory; most player character

(PC)  emissaries  would  fall  into  this

category.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  an  emissary

of Barachiel, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Skills: Diplomacy  8  ranks,

Knowledge (the planes) 4 ranks.

Feats: Servant of the Heavens,

Words of Creation.

Blood of the Martyr (Sp): A 4th-level defender of Sealtiel can

use blood of the martyr*, as the spell, once per day. His effective

caster level is his defender level.

Protective Aura (Sp): A 6th-level defender of Sealtiel can use

protective  aura,  as  the  spell,  once  per  day.  The  effect  overlaps

(does  not  stack  with)  his  constant  magic  circle  against  evil.  His

effective caster level is his defender level.

At 10th level, a defender can use this ability three times per

day.

Gather Information (Cha), Knowledge (all skills, taken individ-

ually)  (Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Perform  (Cha),  Profession  (Wis),

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Emissaries  of  Barachiel

gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: An emissary of Barachiel has the ability to cast a small

number of divine spells. To cast an emissary of Barachiel spell,

the  emissary  must  have  a  Charisma  score  of  at  least  10  +  the

spells  level,  so  an  emissary  with  a  Charisma  of  10  or  lower

cannot cast these spells. Emissary of Barachiel bonus spells are

based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have

a  DC  of  10  +  spell  level  +  the  emissarys  Charisma  modifier.

When the emissary gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance,

1st-level spells for a 1st-level emissary of Barachiel), he gets only

the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma

score for that spell level. The emissarys spell list appears below.

An emissary of Barachiel casts spells just as a bard does, except

that his spells are divine and not arcane.

Calling  (Su): An  emissary  of  Barachiels  most  fundamental

ability is the power to issue a celestial call, stirring the conscience

of those who hear it. An emissary can use this ability once per day

per  class  level,  spending  a  full-round  action  to  issue  the  call.

Humanoid creatures within 30 feet of the emissary are potentially

affected. The emissary makes a Diplomacy check, and the result is

the DC for affected creatures Will saving throws. Creatures that

fail their saves suffer effects that depend on their alignment, as

follows:

Alignment

Lawful good

Neutral good or chaotic good

Lawful neutral

Neutral or chaotic neutral

Any evil

Inspired

Enthralled

Enthralled,

disheartened

Stunned, demoralized

Inspired:  Affected  creatures  receive  a  +2  morale  bonus  on

attack rolls, saving throws, skill and ability checks, and weapon

damage rolls for 10 minutes.

Blessed: Affected creatures receive a +1 morale bonus on attack

rolls and on saving throws against fear effects for 10 minutes.

Enthralled:  Affected  creatures  act  as  if  subject  to  an  enthrall

spell for as long as you continue to speak and for 1d3 rounds

thereafter. For the duration of the effect and for 1 day afterward,

affected  creatures  take  a  1  penalty  on  Will  saves  related  to

redemption (see Chapter 2).

Disheartened:  Affected  creatures  take  a  1  penalty  on  attack

rolls,  saving  throws,  skill  checks,  and  ability  checks  for  10

minutes.

Stunned: Affected creatures are stunned for 1 round.

1 Provided the emissary has sufficient Charisma to have a

bonus spell of this level.

Demoralized:  Affected  creatures  take  a  2  penalty  on  attack

rolls,  saving  throws,  skill  checks,  ability  checks,  and  weapon

damage  rolls  for  10  minutes  (including  the  1  round  during

which they are stunned).

Using any manifestation of the calling class ability requires

the use of the Words of Creation and deals 3d4 points of non-

lethal  damage  to  the  emissary.  Calling  is  an  Enchantment

(Compulsion)  [Language-Dependent,  Mind-Affecting]  effect.

Conversion (Su): A 3rd-level emissary of Barachiel can use

his  calling  ability  to  facilitate  actual  conversion  of  nongood

humanoids. Doing so counts as a use of the calling class ability

(see above) for the day, and the initial effects of the calling are the

sameexcept that the emissary takes 5d4 points of nonlethal

damage instead of 3d4. When the initial effects are over, how-

ever, all creatures that were subject to any effect of the calling

(except lawful good creatures) must make another saving throw.

Creatures who fail begin acting as though their alignment were

one step closer to good. Lawful evil creatures act lawful neutral,

neutral evil creatures act neutral, and chaotic evil creatures act

chaotic  neutral.  Lawful  neutral  and  neutral  good  creatures  act

lawful good. True neutral and chaotic good creatures act neutral

good, and chaotic neutral creatures act chaotic good.

Creatures  affected  by  this  temporary  alignment  shift  can

make new saving throws each day for a total of seven days. If the

emissary is not present at the time a creature makes its save, it

receives a +1 circumstance bonus on the saving throw, and this

bonus increases by 1 for each additional saving throw for which

the emissary is not present.

During these seven days, an affected creature is immune to

any other conversion effect, from the same emissary or a differ-

ent one. During this time, the alignment shift can be reversed

with a break enchantment spell, but the caster must succeed on a

caster level check against a DC equal to the emissarys original

Diplomacy  check  result.  Also  during  this  time,  an  atonement

spell can make the alignment shift permanent, preventing the

creature from making any additional saving throws.

If a creature fails seven saving throws after the initial saving

throw against the calling, the alignment change is permanent.

At this point, the creature can change alignment again, either

through another conversion effect, or voluntarily (in a gradual

manner,  as  alignment  change  normally  worksthe  creature

cannot simply decide to be evil again).

Sustenance (Su): At 5th level, an emissary of Barachiel can

help to keep good creatures good. As a use of his calling ability,

he can produce one of the following effects:

Duplicate the effects of an atonement spell.

Reverse any magical alignment change (such as that

produced by a helm of opposite alignment or a morality

undone spell).

Dispel  a  charm  or  compulsion  effect  cast  by  an

evil  creature  upon  a  good  target,  by  making  a

dispel  check  (1d20  +  character

level  against  a  DC  of  11  +  evil

casters level).

These  effects  require  the  emis-

sary  of  Barachiel  to  touch  the

target creature.

EXALTED ARCANIST

Tales say that sorcerers gain their innate magical ability from dra-

conic  blood,  and  many  sorcerers  (especially  kobold  sorcerers)

loudly  champion  this  legend.  Aasimar  sorcerers,  meanwhile,

smile  to  themselves,  knowing  that  dragons  are  not  the  only

source of spontaneous arcane power. Among both sorcerers and

bards, some trace the source of their power back to celestial influ-

:

ence,  either  bloodline  or  simply  favor.  These  are  the  exalted

arcanists, spontaneous spellcasters who gain access to spells that

channel celestial energy.

Only  characters  who  spontaneously  cast  arcane  spells  can

become exalted arcanists, which means that in most campaigns

the class is limited to sorcerers and bards.

Exalted arcanists are very often adventurers, using the power

they consider a gift to the purpose for which it was intended: to

help combat evil. They gravitate to places where their ability to

cover  a  battlefield  with  holy  smite spells  is  useful,  so  they  are

rarely  found  in  cities  or  placid  villages.  They  frequently  join

forces with other exalted adventurers, much less frequently

with other exalted arcanists.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an exalted arcanist, a charac-

ter must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any good.

Base  Save  Bonuses: Will  +5.

Skills: Knowledge  (arcana)  9

ranks,  Knowledge  (religion)  4

ranks.

Feats: Consecrate  Spell,

Purify Spell.

Spells: Able  to  sponta-

neously cast 3rd-level arcane

spells.

CLASS SKILLS

The exalted arcanists class skills (and

the key ability for each skill) are Con-

centration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Deci-

pher  Script  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),

Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Knowl-

edge  (religion)  (Int),  Perform

Motive  (Wis),  Spellcraft  (Int),

and Use Magic Device (Cha).

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Exalted arcanists gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Exalted Spell List: An exalted arcanist gains access to spells

that do not normally appear on arcane spellcasters spell lists.

The  exalted  arcanists  spell  list  additions  appear  below.  At  1st

level, an exalted arcanist adds the spells of up to 3rd level to her

spell list, and each additional exalted arcanist level grants her

access to two more spell levels on the spell list. She does not

automatically know these spells, but can choose them as spells

known.

Spell Knowledge (Ex): At 1st level, an exalted arcanist learns

two  new  arcane  spells  of  any  level  up  to  the  maximum  spell

level she can cast. These can be spells from her normal spell list

or from the exalted spell list that appears below. She does not

gain any extra spell slots at this level.

Faster Consecrate (Ex): At 2nd level, an exalted arcanist can

spontaneously cast spells with the Consecrate Spell feat without

extending the spells casting time.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each exalted arcanist level

after the first, the character gains new spells per day and spells

known as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting

class  to  which  she  belonged  before  adding  the  prestige  class

level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character

of  that  class  would  have  gained  (bardic  music  abilities,

improved familiar abilities, and so on), though she does retain

the ability to exchange spells known with every even-numbered

equivalent sorcerer or bard level. If the character had more than

one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an exalted arcan-

ist, she must decide to which class she adds each exalted arcan-

ist level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells

known.

Bonus Exalted Feat: At 3rd level, and again at 5th level, an

exalted  arcanist  gains  a  bonus  feat. This  feat  must  be  chosen

from the exalted feats that appear in Chapter 4.

Faster Purify (Ex): At 4th level, an exalted arcanist can spon-

taneously cast spells with the Purify Spell feat without extend-

ing the spells casting time.

Sanctified Spells: A 5th-level exalted arcanist can use sanc-

tified spells as though they were among her spells known.

EXALTED ARCANIST SPELL LIST

Exalted arcanists choose their spells from the following list or

from their normal spell list:

1st Level: bless, vision of heaven*

2nd Level: consecrate, zone of truth

3rd Level: helping hand, searing light

4th Level: holy smite, lesser aspect of the deity*, lesser planar ally,

sword of conscience*

5th Level: crown of flame*, hallow, heavenly lightning*, mark of

justice

6th Level: aspect of the deity*, bolt of glory*, planar ally

7th Level: heavenly lightning storm*, holy word, righteous smite*

8th Level: greater planar ally, holy aura

9th Level: greater aspect of the deity*

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

FIST OF RAZIEL

The fists of Raziel represent a knightly order dedicated to the

celestial  patron  of  holy  warfare  against  evil.  Its  members

include large numbers of paladins, as well as lawful good clerics,

fighters,  rangers,  and  occasionally  warriors.  While  Sealtiel

champions  those  who  defend  good  communities  from  evil

assault, Raziels crusaders lead the charge against evil wherever

it  is  found.  Smiting  evil  is  their  mission  and  their  specialty.

To become a fist of Raziel, a character must already possess

some  degree  of  divine  spellcasting  ability,  so  members  of  the

class  generally  begin  as  paladins  or  clerics,  less  often  as

fighter/clerics  or  ranger/clerics.  Perhaps  strangely,  the  order

includes  a  number  of  ex-barbarians  who  first  multiclassed  as

clerics and then adopted the fist of Raziel prestige class. These

ferocious warriors seem to be drawn to Raziels crusading creed.

The fists of Raziel are an elite, ordered, and disciplined fight-

ing force. To make best use of their power, however, they typi-

cally serve as leaders or advisors to adventuring parties, military

strike  teams,  or  the  armies  of  good  kingdoms,  working  with

members of other classes instead of with each other.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Fist of Raziel, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Skills: Diplomacy  5  ranks,  Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks.

Feats: Power Attack, Servant of the Heavens.

Spells: Able to cast divine favor.

CLASS SKILLS

The fist of Raziels class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Heal

(Wis), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int),

Profession (Wis), and Sense Motive (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the fist of Raziel prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A fist of Raziel is profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor,

and shields (except tower shields).

Magic Circle (Su): A 1st-level fist of Raziel is constantly sur-

rounded by a magic circle against evil effect, as the spell cast by

a cleric of the fists character level.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, a fist of Raziel may attempt to

smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma

bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per

class level. If she accidentally smites a creature that is not evil,

the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. She can

use this ability more times per day as she advances in level, as

shown on Table 510.

If the fist of Raziel has paladin levels as well, add the daily

uses from her fist of Raziel levels to the daily uses from her pal-

adin  levels.  Her  damage  bonus  equals  her  fist  of  Raziel  class

level  plus  her  paladin  class  level. This  ability  does  not  stack

with the smite ability granted by the Destruction domain.

In addition to the basic function of smiting evil, a fist

of  Raziel  gains  special  abilities  that  operate  when-

ever she smites.

Good-Aligned: At 1st level, whenever a fist of Raziel

smites  evil,  her  weapon  is  considered  good-aligned  for

purposes of overcoming damage reduction, as if she

had the Exalted Smite feat.

level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before

adding  the  prestige  class  level.  She  does  not,  however,  gain  any

other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance  of  turning  or  destroying  undead,  improved  special

mount,  and  so  on).  If  the  character  had  more  than  one

divine spellcasting class before becoming a fist of Raziel,

she  must  decide  to  which  class  she  adds  each  fist  of

Raziel level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Sanctify Martial Strike: At 4th level, a fist of

Raziel  gains  the  Sanctify  Martial  Strike  feat  as  a

bonus feat.

:

Confirming: At 3rd level, whenever a fist

of  Raziel  smites  evil,  all  critical  rolls  are

automatically  successful  (so

every threat is a critical hit). This

works even if the weapon has a magical

effect related to critical hits, unlike the

similar effect of the bless weapon spell.

Holy: At 5th level, whenever a fist of

Raziel smites evil, her weapon is con-

sidered  holy,  dealing  an  extra  2d6

points of damage against evil creatures.

This additional damage stacks with the

extra damage she deals from the smite.

However, it does not stack with the bene-

fit  of  the  Sanctify  Martial  Strike  feat  or

with the extra damage dealt by a weapon

with the holy weapon property.

Fiendsmite: At 7th level, whenever a fist

of Raziel smites evil, her weapon deals an

extra 2d8 points of damage against evil out-

siders and evil undead, instead of the +2d6

normally dealt by a holy weapon. If

she  also  has  the  Exalted  Smite

feat,  this  damage  is  still  doubled.

Chain: At  9th  level,  whenever  a

fist  of  Raziel  smites  evil,  bolts  of

holy power erupt from the target crea-

ture  and  strike  up  to  5  additional  evil  targets

within  30  feet,  chosen  by  the  fist  of  Raziel. Targets  take  2d6

points of damage, or 2d8 if they are evil outsiders or evil undead.

A successful Reflex save (DC 15 + the fist of Raziels Cha modi-

fier) reduces the damage by half.

Spells per Day: Starting at 2nd level, and at each level thereafter,

a fist of Raziel gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a

A fist of Raziel

Sunder Evil Item (Su): At 6th level, whenever a fist of Raziel

attacks an object that is evil (such as an unholy sword or a darkskull)

or an evil construct (such as a retriever), she deals double damage.

This does not stack with the benefits of the Great Sunder feat.

Holy Martial Strike (Su): Any weapon that a 10th-level fist of

Raziel  wields  is  treated  as  a  holy  weapon,  dealing  an  extra  2d6

points of damage to evil creatures, even when she is not smiting

INITIATE OF PISTIS SOPHIA

Pistis Sophia is the monk of the Celestial Hebdomad, a contem-

plative, mystic, and ascetic patron for those who follow similar

spiritual paths. The path of her initiates requires great sacri-

fices (in the form of at least three sacred vows), but

brings great rewards of spiritual power.

All  initiates  of  Pistis  Sophia

have  at  least  several  monk

levels before joining the order

of  initiates.  Most  often,  they

are single-classed monks. Occa-

sionally,  characters  of  other

classes  undergo  a  sort  of  conversion,

forswearing their reliance on weap-

ons  and  armor,  multiclassing  as

monks, and later adopting the ini-

tiate  prestige  class.  Of  the  tiny

number of characters who take this

course,  most  were  paladins  before

taking on their monastic vows.

Initiates  of  Pistis  Sophia  are  members  of

spiritual communities sharing a common life.

They are not restricted to their monasteries by

any  means,  and  many  do  adventure  to  put

their spiritual devotions into con-

crete  practice.  However,  when

not actively fighting the forces

of  evil,  they  are  more  often

found in their monasteries than

in cities or towns.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  an  initiate

of Pistis Sophia, a character must

fulfill  all  the  following  criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Base Save Bonuses: Fort +5, Ref

+5, Will +5.

Skills: Concentration 9 ranks.

Feats: Sacred Vow, Sanctify Ki Strike, Servant of the Heavens.

CLASS SKILLS

The initiate of Pistis Sophias class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con),

Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex),

Jump (Str), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion)

(Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profes-

sion  (Wis),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  Spot  (Wis),  Swim  (Str),  and

Tumble (Dex). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level: 4  +  Int  modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the Initiate of

Pistis Sophia prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Initiates  of

Pistis  Sophia  gain  no  proficiency

with any weapon or armor. They

suffer  the  same  penalties  for

that

wearing

armor

monks do.

Fist  of  the  Heav-

ens: A  1st-level  initi-

ate  of  Pistis  Sophia

gains the Fist of the Heav-

ens feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not have

the prerequisite Wisdom score.

Monk Abilities: An initiate of Pistis Sophia

adds her initiate levels to her monk levels to

determine  her  AC  bonus,  her  unarmed

strike  damage,  the  penalty  she  takes

when  using  a  flurry  of  blows,  her

speed,  and  her  ki strike.  She  does

not  gain  any  other  benefits  of

advancing  monk  levels,  however.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, an initi-

ate  of  Pistis  Sophia  of  2nd  level  or

higher can use detect evil, as the spell.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, an initiate of Pistis

Sophia  may  attempt  to  smite  evil  with  one  normal

unarmed strike. She adds a +4 bonus to her attack

roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class

level. If she accidentally smites a creature that

is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is still

used up for that day.

At 5th level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia can use this ability

twice per day, and at 8th level she can use it three times per day.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 3rd level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia

can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to

do  so.  She  retains  her  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC  even  when  flat-

footed.

Electricity Resistance (Ex): As she advances in her celestial

disciplines, an initiate of Pistis Sophia grows to share the natu-

ral immunity to electricity possessed by the archons. She gains

electricity resistance 5 at 4th level, and electricity resistance 10

at 7th level.

Sacred  Vow: At  4th  level,  and  again  at  7th  level  and  10th

level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia gains a bonus feat selected from

the following list:

Vow  of  Abstinence,  Vow  of  Chastity,  Vow  of  Nonviolence,

Vow of Obedience, Vow of Poverty, or Vow of Purity.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 6th level, an initiate of

Pistis Sophia cannot be flanked except by a rogue at least 4 levels

higher than her character level.

Improved  Evasion  (Ex): At  9th  level,  an  initiate  of  Pistis

Sophia  takes  no  damage  on  a  successful  saving  throw  against

attacks that allow a Reflex save for half damage, and she only

takes half damage on a failed save.

Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that

normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a 9th

level initiate of Pistis Sophia takes no damage if she makes a

successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw

fails.

Celestial  Transformation  (Ex): When  she  reaches  10th

level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia transcends her mortal origins

and becomes a creature of the heavens. Her type changes to out-

sider (native), and she gains damage reduction 10/unholy.

A lion of Talisid

LION OF TALISID

The  undisputed  ruler  of  the  guardinals,  Talisid  the  Celestial

Lion  is  an  enormously  powerful  force  for  goodand  good

alone, undiluted by concerns of law or chaos. He is also a mighty

druid, and his mortal and guardinal champions are druids and

rangers who share both his fierce hatred of evil and his passion-

ate love of the natural world and its creatures. Called the lions of

Talisid, these protectors of nature and champions of good emu-

late their celestial patron in more concrete

ways:  adopting  feline  animal  com-

panions,  assuming  great  cat  forms

with  their  wild  shape  ability,  and

eventually roaring like a leonal.

Druids  and  rangers  most  commonly

become lions of Talisid, and

only  a  character

with  an  animal

companion

can enter the

class.  Multiclass

druid/rangers  also  com-

monly adopt the class, and less

commonly,  fighter/druids  or

cleric/rangers.

Like

their  guardinal

patron, lions of Talisid usually

work  alone  or  in  small  groups  of

close  companions,  rarely  with  other  lions.

NPC lions of Talisid can be found wandering the wilder-

class feature.

CLASS SKILLS

The lion of Talisids class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle

Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Listen  (Wis),  Knowledge  (nature)

(Int), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and

Swim  (Str).  See  Chapter  4  of  the  Players  Handbook for  skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the lion of Talisid pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Lions of Talisid gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Animal Companion (Ex): A lion of Talisid can add his lion

of Talisid levels to his effective druid level (his actual druid level

or one-half his ranger level) to determine the capabilities of his

animal companion.

Lions  Courage  (Ex): A  lion  of  Talisid  is  immune  to  fear

(magical or otherwise) and gains a +4 sacred bonus on Will saves

against other mind-affecting spells and effects.

Spells  per  Day: At  each  level,  a  lion  of  Talisid  gains  new

spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spell-

casting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige

class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a char-

acter of that class would have gained. If the character had more

than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a lion of Tal-

isid, the player must decide to which class to add each lion of

Talisid level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Scent (Ex): At 2nd level, a lion of Talisid gains the scent spe-

cial  quality.  He  can  detect  approaching  enemies,  sniff  out

hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Wild Shape (Su): At 3rd level, a lion of Talisid gains the abil-

ity to turn himself into any Small or Medium animal and back

again once per day. This works exactly as the druids wild shape

ability. Lions of Talisid prefer the shape of great cats (cheetahs or

leopards  at  lower  levels),  but  are  not  limited  to  such  forms.

The lion of Talisid can use this ability more times per day at

4th, 5th, and 8th level, as noted on Table 512. In addition, he

gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 6th level,

and a Tiny animal at 9th level.

A lion of Talisid who is also a druid can add his lionof Talisid

level 2 to his druid levels to determine his wild shape ability.

For example, an 8th-level druid/6th-level lion of Talisid can wild

shape as a 12th-level druid, and can thus assume plant forms as

well as Large and Tiny animal forms, and can use this ability 4

times per day.

Exalted Companion: At 4th level, a lion of Talisid gains the

Exalted Companion feat as a bonus feat.

Lions Pounce (Ex): At 5th level, a lion of Talisid can make a

full attack at the end of a charge.

Lions Swiftness (Ex): When he reaches 7th level, a lion of Tal-

isid can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 1

round per class level per day. These rounds need not be consecu-

tive.

Leonals Roar (Su): Three times a day, a 10th-level lion of Tal-

isid can issue a roar that duplicates the effects of the leonals roar

spell (new spell described in Chapter 6 of this book). The saving

throw DC is 20 + the lion of Talisids Charisma modifier.

PROPHET OF ERATHAOL

The prophet of Erathaol is a seer and visionary, a medium of the

heavenly will, pronouncing judgment on corruption and evil in

the  world,  speaking  words  of  comfort  to  the  oppressed  and

downtrodden, and announcing the work of the archons in the

world. She channels celestial spirits and allows them to use her

body for their purposes on the Material Plane. Insofar as these

celestials  have  knowledge  of  future  events,  the  prophet  may

speak  authoritatively  about  events  to  come,  but  her  primary

focus is on changing the present world into a better world for

the future, a place where law and good might reign supreme.

Most  prophets  of  Erathaol  are  clerics,  either  servants  of  a

lawful  good  deity  such  as  Heironeous  or  Moradin  or  propo-

nents of lawful good ideals without particular attention to a spe-

cific  deity.  However,  the  gift  of  prophecy  is  notoriously

indiscriminate,  and  members  of  all  spellcasting  classes  occa-

sionally  find  themselves  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  heavens.

Prophets of Erathaol are not the oracles that people consult

when they want to know whether to launch a business enter-

prise, start a war, or win someones favortoo often prophets

give answers that people dont really want to hear. Lawful good

kings do sometimes take on prophets as advisors, but even the

most  well-intentioned  ruler  has  a  hard  time  following  a  true

prophets advice all the time. Most prophets, with no one seek-

ing out their words, make themselves a nuisance in palaces, in

marketplaces, or on city streets, proclaiming celestial judgment

to whoever listens.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a prophet of Erathaol, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 10 ranks.

Feats: Sacred Vow, Servant of the Heavens, Spell Focus (Div-

ination), Vow of Chastity.

Spells: Able to cast 4th-level arcane or divine spells.

66

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  9:16 AM  Page 67

CLASS SKILLS

The  prophet  of  Erathaols  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Heal  (Wis),

Intimidate  (Cha),  Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Knowledge  (the

planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), and

Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the prophet of

Erathaol prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:

Prophets of Erathaol gain no proficiency

with any weapon or armor.

Ecstasy  (Su): Once  per  day  per  class

level,  a  prophet  of  Erathaol  can  enter  an

ecstatic state, allowing a celestial to seize

control  of  her  mind

and speech. This is

sort of a lesser ver-

sion of channeling

celestials

(as

described in Chap-

ter  2),  in  which  the

prophet  simply  be-

comes  helpless  for  1

round  while  a  celestial

speaks through her. What

the celestial says (and who

it is) is entirely up to the DM,

though it is always at least tangen-

tially relevant to whatever matter is

at hand. As a rule of thumb, this abil-

ity can have one of the following effects:

any Knowledge check (with a bonus

equal  to  the  prophets  character

level +5)

a  bardic  knowledge  check

(with  a  bonus  equal  to  the

prophets  character  level  +5)

a divination spell

a detect evil spell

Unfortunately, at the instant a prophet of Erathaol cedes con-

trol of her mind and invites a celestial to take it, she is vulnera-

ble to possession by less beneficent spirits. If a fiend or ghost

capable  of  possession  is

in  ethereal  form,  within

30  feet  of  the  prophet,

and not flat-footed when

a  prophet  enters  her

ecstasy,  the  creature  can  at-

tempt to possess her immedi-

ately.  The  prophet  takes  a  2

penalty on her Will save to resist

the possession, and if she fails she

is  not  aware  of  the  creatures  pres-

ence  in  her  body.  The  creature  pre-

vents  a  celestial  from  entering,  and

might  pretend  to  be  the  celestial,  speaking  as

the prophets companions expect. If the creature

chooses not to make its presence known in this

way, it seems as though the ecstasy simply fails.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known: At  2nd

level, and at each level thereafter, a prophet

of  Erathaol  gains  new  spells  per  day  (and

spells known, if applicable) as if she had

also gained a level in a spellcasting class

she belonged to before adding the pres-

tige  class.  She  does  not,  however,  gain

any other benefit a character of that class

would  have  gained  (improved  chance  of

turning  or  destroying  undead,  meta-

magic or item creation feats, and so on),

except for an increased effective level of

spellcasting.  If  a  character  had  more

than  one  spellcasting  class  before

becoming a prophet of Erathaol, she

must  decide  to  which  class  she

adds each prophet level for

the  purpose  of  determin-

ing spells per day.

RISEN MARTYR

Characters driven by revenge, greed, or other base desires may

return from death as ghosts, revenants, or other undead. By con-

trast, a risen martyr is an exalted character who continues in his

earthly existence after his martyrdom, rather than entering the

ranks of the petitioners on the celestial planes, in order to finish

some  unfulfilled  task.  Within  a  short  time  of  his  martyrdom

(usually 1d4+1 days), a risen martyr returns in a spiritual body to

complete the holy task that led to his martyrdom. (See Heroic

Sacrifice in Chapter 2 for more about martyrdom.)

In  general,  a  character  who  is  actively  involved  in  an

adventure that involves an exalted goal, and who is mar-

tyred  for  the  sake  of  that  purpose,  has  a  sufficient  holy

purpose to return as a risen martyr. Appropriate holy pur-

poses for a risen martyr might include aiding in the

downfall of an evil tyrant or villain, locating a relic

or holy artifact in order to stave off a great evil,

or  defending  a  city  from  a  plague  of  ghosts.

The goal need not be extremely short-term,

and  might  even  be  the  focus  of  a  whole

campaign.  However,  a  risen  martyrs

time  on  the  Material  Plane  is  limited.

Risen  martyrs  are  very  rare,  and  they

actually  appear  as  player  characters  more

often than as NPCs, simply because player

characters  are  generally  the  ones  who

pursue the most important and holy quests

that can lead to a risen martyrs existence.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  risen  martyr,  a

character  must  fulfill  all  the  following

criteria.

Alignment: Any good.

Base  Save  Bonuses:

Fort  +2,  Ref  +2,  Will +2.

Skills: Any one skill 9

ranks, Speak Language

(Celestial).

Feats: Nimbus

of Light, any one

other exalted feat.

Special: The  character  must  have  suffered  martyrdom  (see

Chapter 2) and must not have been returned to life. As a special

feature of this prestige class, the character rises with the abilities

of a 0-level risen martyr added to the characters previous abili-

ties.  When  the  character  earns  enough  experience  points  to

advance another level, he must become a 1st-level risen martyr.

CLASS SKILLS

The risen martyrs class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information

(Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Knowledge  (the  planes)  (Int),  Knowl-

edge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and

Spot (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  risen

martyr prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Risen

martyrs gain no proficiency with any weapon

or armor.

Spiritual Body (Ex): When a martyr rises as

a  0-level  risen  martyr,  he  takes  on  a  corporeal

spirit form. His creature type changes to death-

less  (see  Chapter  8:  Monsters),  and  he  gains

the  features  and  traits  of  the  deathless  type.

Deathless  creatures  have  no  Constitution

score,  and  the  risen  martyr  rerolls  his  hit

points  using  d12s  instead  of  his  previous

racial and class-based Hit Dice.

A risen martyrs spiritual body is formed

of  solid,  spiritual  flesh  and  is  neither

ghostly  nor  incorporeal.  His  ability

scores remain unchanged (except for

his Constitution score), and all

his  other  characteris-

tics  remain  the  same

except that he is no longer

a living creature.

risen martyrs Charisma score increases by +2. At 5th level, it

increases by an extra +2.

Deflection  Bonus  (Su): A  1st-level  risen  martyr  gains  a

deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to his Charisma bonus.

Holy  Purpose  (Ex): A  1st-level  risen  martyr  receives  a  +1

sacred bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, and

skill checks that are directly related to the fulfillment of his pur-

pose. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, and increases by an

extra +1 every 3 levels thereafter.

Bless (Sp): Three times per day, a risen martyr of at least 2nd

level can use bless, as the spell.

Magic Circle Against Evil (Su): At 2nd level, a risen martyr

is continually surrounded by a protective aura that functions as

a magic circle against evil spell.

Daylight (Su): At will as a free action, a 3rd level

risen martyr can use daylight, as the spell.

Acid  Immunity  (Ex): At  4th  level,  a

risen martyr gains immunity to acid.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a risen martyr of at

least  4th  level  can  detect  evil,  as  the  spell.

Protective  Aura  (Su): At  5th

level, the risen martyrs magic circle

against evil is replaced by an effect

that  duplicates  the  protective  aura

spell.

Shield  Other (Sp): A  6th-level

risen martyr can use shield other, as the

spell, three times per day.

Celestial  Brilliance (Sp): A  7th-level

risen martyr can use celestial bril-

liance,  as  the  spell,  once  per

day.

Cold  Immunity  (Ex): A  7th-

level risen martyr gains immunity

to cold.

Holy Aura (Su): At 8th level, the risen

martyrs protective aura is supplemented

by an effect that duplicates the holy aura

spell.  The  holy  aura  protects  only  the

risen martyr, while his protective aura

continues to protect allies within 10

feet as well as himself.

Electricity  Immunity

(Ex): At  9th  level,  a  risen

martyr gains immunity to

electricity.

Perfection (Su): A 10th-

A risen martyr cannot advance in any class other than risen

martyr in order to delay his final ascension. Once he rises and

adopts this prestige class, he must continue to gain risen martyr

levels and no levels in any other class.

Code of Conduct: A risen martyr who willfully performs an

evil act is immediately destroyed and goes to face his judgment

on the Upper Planes.

SENTINEL OF BHARRAI

Respect for the power of nature, the desire to further

the ends of good, and the resolve to destroy evil are

the  core  beliefs  of  the  sentinels  of  Bharrai,  strong-

willed spellcasters who venerate The Great Bear of Ely-

sium. Their  initiates  hail  primarily  from  the  ranks  of

wizards, although sorcerers, druids, and clerics may also

become sentinels.

Sentinels of Bharrai put the needs of others before their

own, and they value stalwart companionship and loyalty

above  all.  This  is  an  important  aspect  of  their  loose

organization, which sometimes calls members to sac-

rifice  their  lives  to  ensure  the  sur-

vival of Bharrais ideals. Because of

their loyalty and commitment to

good, sentinels of Bharrai have a good reputa-

tion among adventurers and are highly sought

after as adventuring companions.

appreciate nature in all

its  forms,  from  the

tranquil  beauty

of an undisturbed

forest  to  the  ferocious

wrath  of  a  tornado.  They  also  har-

ness the power of nature to cast down evil.

A sentinel of Bharrai

level  risen  martyr  is  as  close  to

celestial perfection  as a mortal  creature  can be.

He is considered a celestial for the purpose of any spell or effect

that  has  special  effects  on  celestials.  If  he  is  lawful,  he  is  also

considered an archon. If he is chaotic, he is also considered an

eladrin. If he is neutral, he is also considered a guardinal. If he is

a spellcaster, he can cast spells that have the Celestial, Archon,

Guardinal, or Eladrin components, as appropriate.

Final Ascension: When a 10th-level risen martyr has earned

enough experience points to gain his next level, his perfected,

spiritual body is taken whole into the upper planes.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a sentinel of Bharrai, a character must ful-

fill the following criteria:

Alignment: Any good.

Skills: Knowledge  (arcana)  8  ranks,  Knowledge  (nature)  8

ranks, Spellcraft 8 ranks.

Feats: Sacred Vow, Vow of Obedience.

CLASS SKILLS

The sentinel of Bharrais class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Alchemy (Int), Concentration (Con), Decipher Script

(Int, exclusive skill), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal

(Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Knowledge  (all  skills  taken  individually)

(Int), Profession (Wis), Read/Write Language, Speak Language,

Spellcraft  (Int),  Survival  (Wis),  and  Use  Magic  Device  (Cha,

exclusive skill). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the sentinel of Bharrai

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sentinels of Bharrai gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a sentinel of

Bharrai gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applica-

ble) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she

belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, how-

ever, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have

gained  (improved  chance  of  turning  or  destroying  undead,

metamagic  or  item  creation  feats,  and  so  on),  except  for  an

increased  effective  level  of  spellcasting.  If  the  character  had

more than one spellcasting class before becoming a sentinel of

Bharrai, she must decide to which class she adds each sentinel

level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Nature-Friendly Spells (Su): Starting at 1st level, a sentinel

of  Bharrai  can  change  the  composition  of  any  energy-based

spell he casts to something that is not destructive to nature. The

spell must have the acid, cold, electricity, or fire subtype, and the

sentinel  of  Bharrai  may  choose  to  deal  nonlethal  damage

instead  of  lethal  damage  against  animals  and  plants  that  are

either targeted or otherwise affected by the spell.

Track: A 1st-level sentinel of Bharrai gains the Track feat as a

bonus feat.

Energy Resistance 10 (Ex): A sentinel of Bharrai is resistant

to certain forces of nature and the damage they wreak. At 2nd

level, and again at 4th level, 6th level, and 8th level, a sentinel of

Bharrai chooses a specific type of energyacid, cold, electricity,

or  fireand  gains  resistance  10  against  the  selected  energy

type.

Bear Shape (Su): At 3rd level, the sentinel of Bharrai gains

the ability to turn himself into a black bear, brown bear, or polar

bear (and back again). The selected bear forms Hit Dice cannot

exceed the sentinel of Bharrais character level.

This ability functions as the polymorph spell, except as noted

here. Changing form is a standard action and doesnt provoke

attacks of opportunity. The sentinel of Bharrai may assume bear

form (and change back) at will and may remain in bear form as

long as he wishes.

The sentinel of Bharrai retains the ability to speak while in

bear form and may communicate with other bears.

Quickened Call Lightning (Sp): At 3rd level, a sentinel of Bhar-

rai  can  cast  a  quickened  call  lightning spell  once  per  day,  as

though using the Quicken Spell feat. Use the sentinel of Bhar-

rais character level to determine the number of lightning bolts

and the spells duration.

Natures Veil (Su): At 5th level, as a standard action, the sen-

tinel of Bharrai can attempt to hide in the outdoors. The sentinel

of Bharrai must be standing within 10 feet of natural terrain that

includes  features  such  as  trees,  sand  dunes,  mounds  of  snow,

large rocks, tall grasses, or thickets. The sentinel of Bharrai gains

a  +10  insight  bonus  on  his  Hide  check  under  these  circum-

stances.

Dire Bear Shape (Su): At 7th level, a sentinel of Bharrai can

turn himself into a dire bear and back again. This ability is oth-

erwise  the  same  as  the  bear  form  ability  gained  at  3rd  level.

Ursinals Touch (Su): A sentinel of Bharrai gains great heal-

ing powers at 7th level. This ability works just like the paladins

lay on hands ability, except that the sentinel of Bharrai can heal

as much damage per day as his own undamaged hit point total.

Cavalry  of  Dire  Bears (Sp): Once  per  week  beginning  at  9th

level, a sentinel of Bharrai may call 1d6 dire bears with maxi-

mum hit points (147 hp each) to aid him in battle. The dire bears

appear instantly and remain until the battle has ended, at which

point they disperse into the wild. If a dire bear falls in battle, the

animals corpse remains, and the sentinel of Bharrai is expected

to use whatever parts of the animal he can (such as the meat,

skin,  and  bones)  and  commit  the  rest  to  the  earth.  Failing  to

properly  honor  a  fallen  dire  bear  results  in  a  20%  cumulative

chance  that  the  animals  do  not  come  the  next  time  they  are

called.

This ability works only on the Material Plane and on good-

aligned outer planes.

Quickened  Lightning  Storm  (Sp):  At  10th  level,  a  sentinel  of

Bharrai can cast a quickened lightning storm spell once per day, as

though using the Quicken Spell feat. Use the sentinel of Bhar-

rais character level to determine the number of lightning bolts

and the spells duration.

SKYLORD

An elf crusader, the skylord uses his kinship with creatures of

the sky and the power of the winds to fight evil. His ties with

the elven community are generally loose at best, since he sees

much more urgency in the day-to-day events of the world. This

point of view is often lost on the elven lords who would prefer

to insulate themselves from the affairs of the shorter-lived races.

Elves who become skylords often come from the ranks of bar-

barians, fighters, druids, and rangers.

Soaring above the world of men, the skylord observes

all.  From  such  a  vantage  point,  the  skylord  learns  to

appreciate  the  beauty  of  the  world  below,  ply  the

winds, and use the rage of storms to his advantage. He

can quickly disappear by cloaking himself in clouds to

avoid  his  foes.  During  a  battle,  his  presence

inspires confidence in all airborne

allies  who  fight  at  his  side.

The skylord often serves

as  an  aerial  scout,

watching  the  move-

ments  of  evil  armies

and  studying  areas

not easily reached by land.

He  is  also  a  courier,  conveying

messages  across  great  distances  much  more

quickly  than  would  otherwise  be  possible

without the use of magic. The skylord truly

shines when evil bears its ugly head in the sky,

but when necessary, he is a capable fighter indoors

or underground.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a skylord, a character must fulfill the fol-

lowing criteria:

Alignment: Any good.

Race: Elf or half-elf.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Skills: Handle Animal 10 ranks, Ride 10 ranks.

Feats: Mounted Combat, either Mounted Archery or Ride-

By Attack, one exalted feat.

Special: The character must spend 1 week living and medi-

tating atop a mountain.

CLASS SKILLS

The skylords class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Balance  (Dex),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Knowledge

Table 516: The Skylord

(all  skills  taken  individually)  (Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Ride  (Dex),

Spot  (Wis),  and  Survival  (Wis).  See  Chapter  4  of  the  Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  skylord  prestige

class.

A skylord

Weapon  and  Armor  Profi-

ciency: A  skylord  is  proficient

with  all  simple  and  martial

weapons, all types of armor, and

shields.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:

At  every  second  level,  a  skylord  gains

new  spells  per  day  (and  spells  known,  if

applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spell-

casting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He

does  not,  however,  gain  any  other  benefit  a  character  of  that

class  would  have  gained  (improved  chance  of  controlling  or

rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points

beyond  those  he  receives  from  the  prestige  class,  and  so  on),

except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a char-

acter had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a

skylord, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for

purposes of determining spells per day.

Call Flying Mount (Su): At 1st level as a full-round action,

the  skylord  can  call  a  flying  mount  to  serve  in  his  crusade

against evil. This mount can be a celestial giant eagle, celestial

Skylords  Mount  Basics: Use  the  base  statistics  for  a  crea-

ture of the mounts kind (see Sample Skylords Mounts side-

bar, below), but make changes to take into account the attrib-

utes  and  characteristics  summarized  on  the  table  and

described below.

Bonus  HD: Extra  10-sided  (d10)  Hit  Dice,  each  of  which

gains  a  Constitution  modifier,  as  normal.  Extra  Hit  Dice

improve  the  mounts  base  attack  bonus,  base  save  bonuses,

and  celestial  creature  special  qualities  (damage  reduction,

energy resistance, and spell resistance). A mounts base attack

bonus  is  equal  to  that  of  a  fighter  of  a  level  equal  to  the

mounts  Hit  Dice.  A  mount  has  good  Fortitude  and  Reflex

saves  (treat  it  as  a  character  whose  level  equals  the  mounts

HD). The mount doesnt gain any extra skills or feats for bonus

Hit Dice.

Natural Armor Adj.: The number on the table is an improve-

ment to the mounts existing natural armor bonus.

Str Adj.: Add this value to the mounts Strength score.

Empathic Link (Su): A skylord has an empathic link with his

mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The skylord cannot see

through the mounts eyes, but they can communicate empath-

ically. Because of this empathic link, the skylord has the same

connection  to  an  item  or  place  that  his  mount  does,  just  as

with  a  master  and  his  familiar  (see  Familiars  in  the  Players

Handbook).

Share Spells: At the skylords option, he may have any spell

(but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his

mount. The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting

to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other

than  instantaneous,  it  stops  affecting  the  mount  if  it  moves

farther  than  5  feet  away  and  will  not  affect  the  mount  again

even  if  it  returns  to  the  skylord  before  the  duration  expires.

Additionally, the skylord may cast a spell with a target of You

on his mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A

skylord  and  his  mount  can  share  spells  even  if  the  spells

normally do not affect magical beasts.

Improved Natural Attacks: The damage dealt by each of the

mounts natural attacks increases by one step. For example, a

giant  eagle  mount  with  this  ability  would  roll  1d8  instead  of

1d6 for claw damage and 1d10 instead of 1d8 for bite damage.

Improved Fly Speed (Ex): The mounts fly speed increases by

10 feet.

Deadly Charge (Ex): The skylords mount deals an extra 2d6

points of damage on a successful attack made during a charge.

Spell Resistance (Su): A mounts spell resistance equals the

skylords character level + 5.

Immunities (Su): A skylords mount is immune to hold, paral-

ysis, sleep, charms, and compulsions.

giant  owl,  or  celestial  pegasus  (consult  the  Skylords  Mounts

sidebar for details). The mount remains with the skylord until it

is slain or dismissed. It requires food and rest, and the skylord is

responsible for tending to its needs.

Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect. If the mount

dies, the skylord can either have the mount raised from the dead

or call another mount. The skylord may only call a replacement

mount after living and meditating atop a mountain for 1 week.

Eyes of the Eagle (Ex): A skylord has the keen eyesight of an

eagle. While airborne, a skylord receives a +4 insight bonus on

Spot checks.

Ride the Wind (Ex): At 2nd level, a skylord becomes

a  master  of  the  winds,  guiding  his  mount  through

them with ease. While riding a flying mount, the sky-

lords  penalties  on  ranged  attacks  in  windy  condi-

tions  are  reduced  by  2  (no  penalty  in  strong

winds,  2  penalty  in  severe  winds). The  sky-

lord can make ranged attacks in windstorms,

albeit  at  a  4  penalty.  In  hurricanes,  the

ranged attack penalty increases to 8. Nei-

ther the skylord nor his mount take penal-

ties on Listen checks in windstorms and

hurricanes.

Both the skylord and his mount can move

normally  in  severe  winds  and  windstorms

(instead  of  being  checked),  and  hurricane

winds reduce the flying speed of the sky-

lords mount by half.

Improved  Mounted  Combat  (Ex):

At 3rd level, a skylords skill at mounted

combat  improves,  enabling  him  to

better  protect  his  mount. This  ability

works as the Mounted Combat feat,

except that the skylords Ride check

receives  a  +2  bonus.  The  bonus

improves to +4 at 5th level, +6 at 7th

level, and +8 at 9th level.

Deadly  Charge  (Ex): At  4th

level,  a  skylord  deals  an  extra  2d6

points  of  damage  on  a  successful

attack made during a charge. The sky-

lord  must  be  riding  a

flying  mount  to  deal  the

extra damage.

Storm Kinship (Su): At 6th level, a skylord is less likely to

lose his bearings in a storm. He retains full visibility during rains

and storms and does not take the usual penalties on Search, Spot,

and Listen checks (see Weather in the Dungeon Masters Guide).

This ability is not imparted to the skylords mount.

Summon Tempest (Sp): At 10th level, once per week, the sky-

lord  can  summon  a  tempest  (as  described  on  page  193  of  the

Monster  Manual  II).  This  ability  is  otherwise  similar  to  the

summon  monster  I  spell.  Use  the  skylords  character  level  to

determine the effects range and duration.

SLAYER OF DOMIEL

Assassins,  of  course,  are  evil  by  their  nature  and  the

nature of what they do: committing murder for money

is a completely evil act. However, sometimes the skill

set of an assassin is required for more noble pur-

poses. Claiming the power of the paragon archon

Domiel, the slayers of Domiel are a disciplined,

secretive order of stealthy spies andwhen

the need arisesassassins who serve the

cause of law and good. Rather than rely-

ing entirely on stealth and poison, the

slayers  of  Domiel  use  supernatural

means to dispatch evil foes.

Rogues  most  commonly  be-

come slayers of Domiel. On very

rare  occasions,  the  order  ac-

cepts  former  assassins  who

have  repented  and  atoned

for  their  past  evil  deeds

and wish to become slay-

ers.  Some  slayers  also

have  monk,  fighter,

or  even  paladin

levels.  Sorcerer/

rogues and cleric/

rogues  are  also

found  among  their  numbers.

Slayers of Domiel often work closely

with other lawful good characters, but

not often with other slayers. Every

slayer has a superior in the order

responsible  for  mentoring,

training,  and  supervising  her

she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that

spell level.

The  slayer  of  Domiels  spell  list  appears  below.  A  slayer  of

Domiel prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a

slayer cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Death  Touch  (Su): A  slayer  of  Domiel  can  slay  living  evil

opponents  with  a  single  touch.  She  must  succeed  on  a  melee

touch attack against the target. When she touches, she rolls 1d6

per slayer level. If the total at least equals the targets current hit

points, it dies. This is a death effect, and it has no effect on nonevil

creatures.

A  slayer  of  Domiel  can  use  this  ability  more  often  as  she

increases in levels, as shown on Table 517.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell of the same name.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If a slayer of Domiel can catch an oppo-

nent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her

attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time a

slayers  target  would  be  denied  his  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC

(whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the

slayers attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level

and an additional 1d6 at every two slayer levels thereafter (3rd,

5th, 7th, and 9th). Should a slayer of Domiel score a critical hit

with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

It  takes  precision  and  penetration  to  hit  a  vital  spot,  so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

within 30 feet.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a slayer of Domiel can make

a  sneak  attack  that  deals  nonlethal  damage  instead  of  lethal

progress,  but  some  slayers  go  for  months  between  meetings

with their superiors. Few slayers know of more than one or two

other slayers besides their mentors.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a slayer of Domiel, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks.

Feats: Sanctify Martial Strike, Servant of the Heavens.

Special: Sneak attack +3d6, evasion class ability.

CLASS SKILLS

The slayer of Domiels class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Bluff  (Cha),  Climb  (Str),  Craft  (Int),

Diplomacy  (Cha),  Disguise  (Cha),  Gather  Information  (Cha),

Hide  (Dex),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Jump  (Str),  Listen  (Wis),  Move

Silently  (Dex),  Open  Lock  (Dex),  Search  (Int),  Sense  Motive

(Wis), Spot (Wis), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and

Use Rope (Dex). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  slayer  of  Domiel

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Slayers of Domiel gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: A  slayer  of  Domiel  has  the

ability  to  cast  a  small  number  of

divine spells. To cast a slayer of

Domiel  spell,  the  slayer

must  have  a  Wisdom

score  of  at  least  10  +

the  spells  level,  so  a

slayer  of  Domiel

with  a  Wisdom  of

10  or  lower  can-

not  cast  these

spells.  Slayer  of

Domiel  bonus

spells  are  based

on Wisdom, and

saving  throws

against  these

spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level

+  the  slayers

Wisdom modifier.

When  the  slayer  of

Domiel  gets  0  spells

of  a  given  spell  level

(for instance, 1st-level

spells  for  a  1st  level

slayer  of  Domiel),  she

gets only the bonus spells

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  9:19 AM  Page 75

deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual

4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in

order to execute the sneak attack.

A slayer of Domiel can only sneak attack living creatures with

discernible anatomiesundead, constructs, oozes, plants, and

incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that

is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The

slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a

vital  spot  and  must  be  able  to  reach  such  a  spot.  A  slayer  of

Domiel cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with con-

cealment  or  striking  the  limbs  of  a  creature  whose  vitals  are

beyond reach.

If a slayer of Domiel gets a sneak attack bonus from another

source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.

Divine Grace (Su): A 2nd-level slayer of Domiel applies her

Charisma bonus as a bonus on all saving throws.

Improved  Evasion  (Ex):  At  6th  level,  a  slayer  of  Domiels

evasion ability improves. When subjected to an attack that nor-

mally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the slayer

takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw and half

damage if the saving throw fails.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

STALKER OF KHARASH

Kharash, one of the Five Companions of Talisid, is the greatest

of the wolflike lupinal guardinals. As a fierce opponent of evil,

Kharash  acts  as  patron  to  those  who  use  stealth  to  track  and

hunt evildoers. The stalkers of Kharash are a loose-knit order of

rangers,  rogues,  and  other  characters  devoted  to  fighting  evil

under Kharashs patronage.

Rangers predominate among the stalkers, bringing a combi-

nation of stealth and martial prowess to the class at the outset.

Rogues also commonly adopt the class, and bards occasionally

take  it  up.  Few  other  characters,  except  multiclass  rangers  or

rogues,  can  meet  the  skill  requirements  to  become  stalkers.

Stalkers of Kharash prefer to work in small groups such as

adventuring parties. Some prefer the company of other stealthy

characters, while others enjoy working as a scout for a group of

normal,  noisy  characters.  Whether  PCs  or  NPCs,  stalkers  are

usually  found  in  the  wilderness,  wherever  evil  foes  can  be

found.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a stalker of Kharash, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Neutral good.

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Favored of the Companions, Track.

CLASS SKILLS

The stalker of Kharashs class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Climb  (Str),  Concentration  (Con),  Handle  Animal

(Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (geogra-

phy)  (Int),  Knowledge  (nature)  (Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Move

Silently  (Dex),  Ride  (Dex),  Search  (Int),  Spot  (Wis),  Survival

(Wis),  Swim  (Str),  and  Use  Rope  (Dex).  See  Chapter  4  of  the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the stalker of Kharash

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  stalker  of  Kharash  is

proficient  with  all  martial  weapons,  but  no  armor  or  shield.

Spells per Day: Starting at 1st level, and at each stalker of

Kharash level thereafter, the character gains new spells per day

as if she had also gained a level in the ranger class. He does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would

have gained (improved favored enemies and so on). If the char-

acter had no ranger levels before becoming a 1st-level stalker of

Kharash, he gains the spellcasting ability of a 1st-level ranger

that is, no spellcasting abilitywhen he takes his first stalker

level. When he becomes a 4th-level stalker, he gains spellcasting

ability (as a 4th-level ranger) assuming his Wisdom score is high

enough to grant him a bonus 1st-level spell.

A stalker of Kharashs caster level is one-half the sum of his

ranger levels and his stalker levels.

Scent of Evil (Su): A stalker of Kharash has an unusual abil-

ity  that  combines  the  scent  special  quality  with  the  detect  evil

spell. The stalker can detect evil opponents within 30 feet by

their  scent  of  evil.  If  the  opponent  is  upwind,  the  range

increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. A strong

aura of evil (an evil outsider or evil cleric of 510 HD, an evil ele-

mental or undead of 1021 HD, an evil creature of 2554 HD, or

an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of 1021) can be

detected at twice these ranges. An overwhelming aura of evil

(an evil outsider or evil cleric with 11 HD or more, an evil ele-

mental or undead with 22 HD or more, an evil creature with 55

HD or more, or an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of

22 or higher) can be detected at triple normal range.

When  the  stalker  detects  a  scent,  the  exact  location  is  not

revealedonly  its  presence  somewhere  within  range.  The

stalker  can  take  a  move  action  to  note  the  direction  of  the

scent.  Whenever  the

creature  comes  within

5  feet  of  the  source,

the stalker knows the

sources location.

Favored  Enemy

Evil  (Ex): At  2nd  level,  a

stalker of Kharash gains evil creatures of

all kinds as a favored enemies. He gains a +1

bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

and Survival checks when using these skills

against  evil  creatures.  He  also  gains  a  +1

bonus  on  weapon  damage  rolls  against

evil  creatures.  This  bonus  stacks  with

any  other  favored  enemy  bonus

the  stalker  might  have,  such  as

from the ranger class.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): When a

stalker  of  Kharash  reaches  4th

level,  he  can  use  the  Hide  skill

even while being observed. With

at  least  one-quarter  cover  or

one-quarter concealment,

the  stalker  can  hide

from view.

Track Evil (Su): A

5th-level stalker can

use the Track feat to

track an evil creature

by  its  lingering  evil

aura,  making  a  Wis-

dom (or Survival) check

to  find  or  follow  a  track.  The

typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no

matter  what  kind  of  surface  holds  the

Table 519: The Swanmay

A swanmay

scent). The DC for tracking a normal aura increases by 2 every

10 minutes, for tracking a strong aura by 2 every hour, and for

tracking an overwhelming aura by 2 every day. This ability oth-

erwise follows the rules for the Track feat. The stalker can ignore

the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, a 6th-level stalker of Kha-

rash  may  attempt  to  smite  evil  with  one  normal  unarmed

strike. He adds a +4 bonus to his attack roll and deals 1 extra

point of damage per class level. This bonus damage stacks with

favored  enemy  bonuses.  If  he  accidentally  smites  a  creature

that is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for

that day.

At 8th level, a stalker of Kharash can use this abil-

ity  twice  per  day,  and  at  10th  level  he  can  use  it

three times per day.

SWANMAY

Swanmays are members

of  a  secretive  order

sworn  to  protect  wilder-

ness areas from evil. Their

most  distinctive  feature  is

their  ability  to  adopt  the

form  of  a  swan,  which

they  use  primarily  for

mobility.  The  order

accepts  only  wo-

men  who  are

committed  to  the

cause of good and

who  already  pos-

sess  a  strong

affinity for the

natural  world.

Only  druids

and  rangers

can  become

swanmays.  It

is very rare for

even  multiclass

characters  to  join

the  swanmay  order.

Swanmays  often  live

in  communal  lodges  near

bodies of water secluded in deep

forests.  On  the  rare  occasions  when

they travel beyond their woods to adventure, it is to oppose an

evil  force  that  threatens  the  larger  wilderness. They  are  very

secretive, and avoid revealing their true nature even to adven-

turing companions.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a swanmay, a character must fulfill all the

following criteria.

Gender: Female.

Alignment: Any good.

Skills: Knowledge  (nature)  8  ranks,  Speak  Language

(Sylvan), Survival 8 ranks.

Feats: Sacred Vow, Vow of Purity.

Spells: Able to cast speak with animals.

Special: The character must have the wild empathy class fea-

ture.

Special: Knowingly or not, a character must perform a great

service  for  another  swanmay  before  she  can  join  the  order.

CLASS SKILLS

The swanmays class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Heal

(Wis),  Hide  (Dex),  Knowledge  (geography)  (Int),  Knowledge

(nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search

(Int), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

See  Chapter  4  of  the  Players  Handbook  for  skill  descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the swanmay prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Swanmays gain no profi-

ciency with any weapon or armor.

Shifting (Su): The hallmark of the swanmay is the ability to

assume the form of a swan. She can assume this form and return

to her normal form once per day at 1st level. This is identical to

the druids wild shape ability, except that the swanmay can only

assume the form of a swan. The swanmay can use this ability

more times per day at 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th level, as noted on

Table 519.

Swan: CR 1/3; Small Animal; HD 1d8; hp 4; Init +2; Spd 10 ft.,

fly 60 ft. (average); AC 14 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +1 natural), touch 13,

flat-footed  12;  Atk  +1  melee  (1d31,  2  slams)  and  4  melee

(1d21, bite); SQ damage reduction 5/cold iron; AL N; SV Fort

+2, Ref +4, Will +1; Str 8, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 6.

Skills and Feats: Listen +7, Spot +3; Alertness.

Damage Reduction (Ex): While in swan form, a swanmay gains

damage reduction 5/cold iron.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A swanmay has spell resistance equal

to 12 + her swanmay level.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A swanmay adds her class level to her

druid or ranger level when making a wild empathy check. In

addition,  at  4th  level  she  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  wild  empathy

checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 10th

level.

Spells per Day: Starting at 2nd level, and at each swanmay

level thereafter, the character gains new spells per day as if she

had also gained a level in either druid or ranger, whichever class

she belonged to before adding the prestige class level. She does

not,  however,  gain  any  other  benefit  a  character  of  that  class

would  have  gained.  If  the  character  was  both  a  druid  and  a

ranger before becoming a swanmay, she must decide to which

class she adds each swanmay level for the purpose of determin-

ing spells per day.

Favored  Enemy  (Ex): At  2nd  level,  a  swanmay  gains  a

favored enemy. This works just like the rangers favored enemy

ability, and if the swanmay has one or more favored enemies

already, the bonus against one of her favored enemies increases

as  if  she  had  just  gained  another  favored  enemy  from  her

ranger class. The swanmay does not choose this favored enemy

herself;  rather,  each  order  of  swanmays  has  its  own  favored

enemy,  typically  related  to  a  group  that  frequently  threatens

their home region.

Low-Light Vision (Su): At 3rd level, a swanmay gains low-

light vision.

Charm  Person (Sp): At  4th  level,  a  swanmay  can  use  charm

person, as the spell, three times per day. Her caster level is equal

to her swanmay level, and the saving throw DC is equal to 13 +

her Charisma modifier.

Speak With Animals (Sp): At 5th level, a swanmay can use speak

with animals, as the spell, at will. Her caster level is equal to her

swanmay level.

Speak With Plants (Sp): At 6th level, a swanmay can use speak

with plants, as the spell, at will. Her caster level is equal to her

swanmay level.

Charm Monster (Sp): At 7th level, a swanmay can use charm

monster, as the spell, two times per day. Her caster level is equal

to her swanmay level, and the saving throw DC is equal to 15 +

her Charisma modifier.

Fey Transformation (Ex): At 10th level, a swanmays type

changes  to  fey.  Additionally,  she  gains  damage  reduction

10/cold iron, regardless of whether she is in humanoid form or

swan form.

SWORD OF

RIGHTEOUSNESS

The call of exalted deeds does not exclude the path of the war-

rior.  Though  few  in  number,  warriors  of  every  stripe  devote

themselves  to  good,  choosing  a  higher  calling  than  their  fel-

lows.  Even  among  paladins,  some  pursue  a  commitment  to

righteousness and purity that exceeds the norm, truly exalting

them  above  their  peers.  These  men  and  women  are  called

swords of righteousness.

The sword of righteousness prestige class is simply a way for

a  martially  oriented  charactertypically  a  paladin,  fighter,

ranger, barbarian, monk, or even rogueto gain more exalted

feats  at  the  cost  of  a  slightly  slower  progression  in  his  or  her

basic class. It is not intended as a lifelong career path, just a side-

track allowing such a character to focus for a short while on the

trappings of righteousness. Spellcasting characters (bards, cler-

ics,  druids,  sorcerers,  and  wizards)  tend  toward  the  wonder-

worker prestige class to accomplish the same goal.

TROUBADOUR OF STARS

With the exception of Gwynharwyf, who holds her barbarian

champions in special regard, the various lords and knights of

the eladrin Court of Stars do not sponsor individual orders of

followers. Rather, as a group they offer their patronage to certain

mortal bards, granting them the ability to channel their celestial

music  through  their  mortal  voices  and  instruments.  These

blessed bards are the troubadours of stars, gifted musicians and

champions of good.

Only a character who spontaneously casts arcane spells can

become a troubadour of stars. Bards are the most common, but

a very few sorcerers take up the eladrins mantle as well.

Troubadours  of  stars  tend  to  wander  alone,  or  as  part  of  a

small band, traveling far and wide across the mortal world.

They strive to bring hope to the hopeless and free-

dom to those oppressed or enslaved by tyrants.

Whenever  one  troubadour  encounters

another on her travels, the two exchange

stories  and  news  before  continuing  on

their separate ways. They are duty-bound

to help each other in times of need, but

rarely  seek  out  extensive  contact  with

others of their order.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  troubadour  of

stars, a character must fulfill all the fol-

lowing criteria.

Alignment: Chaotic good.

Skills: Perform 6 ranks.

Feats: Knight of Stars.

Spells: Able  to  spontaneously  cast  4th-

level arcane spells.

CLASS SKILLS

The troubadour of stars class skills (and the

key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex),

Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft

(Int),  Decipher  Script  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Dis-

guise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information

(Cha),  Hide  (Dex),  Jump  (Str),  Knowledge  (all  skills,

taken  individually)  (Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Move  Silently

(Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive

(Wis),  Sleight  of  Hand  (Dex),  Speak  Language,

Spellcraft  (Int),  Swim  (Str),  Tumble  (Dex),

and Use Magic Device (Cha). See Chapter 4

of  the  Players  Handbook for  skill  descrip-

tions.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level: 6  +  Int  modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the troubadour of stars

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Troubadours of stars gain

no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Bardic Music: A troubadour of stars adds her class level to

her bard level, if any, to determine what bardic music abilities

she can use and how often she can use them. In addition, her

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  9:21 AM  Page 79

troubadour  levels  stack  with  her  bard  levels  for  purposes  of

determining the bonus granted by her bestow courage ability. A

troubadour of stars with no bard levels gains bardic music abili-

ties as a bard of her class level.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell.

Holy Cacophony (Su): A 2nd-level troubadour of stars with

8 or more ranks in Perform can, as an extra bardic music effect,

create  a  song  of  discordant  notes  that  hampers  evil  creatures.

Any evil creature within 30 feet of the troubadour must make a

successful Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) in order to

cast a spell or use a spell-like ability. Using the Words of Cre-

ation with this ability increases the save DC to 20 + spell level

and  deals  8d4  points  of  nonlethal  damage  to  the  troubadour.

Holy cacophony is a sonic, mind-affecting ability.

Celestial Spells: Once she reaches 2nd level, a troubadour of

stars can cast spells as if she were an eladrin. Specifically, the

troubadour can learn and cast any spell described in Chap-

ter 6 that has a celestial or eladrin component, as long as

she  can  otherwise  cast  the  spell  (it  appears  on  her

spell list, it is of a level of spells that she can cast, and

she has a sufficient ability score to cast spells of

that level).

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each even-

the

numbered troubadour of stars level, the char-

acter  gains  new  spells  per  day  and  spells

known  as  if  she  had

also  gained  a  level

in an arcane spell-

casting  class  to

which  she  belonged

before  adding

prestige class level. The class must

spontaneously cast spells (as a

sorcerer  or  bard  does).  She

does  not,  however,  gain  any  other

benefit a character of that class would have gained (bardic

music  abilities,  improved  familiar  abilities,  and  so  on).  If

the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a troubadour of stars, she must decide

to  which  class  she  adds  each  troubadour  level  for

the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Starmantle (Sp): At  3rd

level, a troubadour of stars gains

the  ability  to  use  starmantle,  as  the  spell

(see  Chapter  6),  once  per  day.  Her  caster  level  is  equal  to  her

character level.

Song of Hope (Su): A 5th-level troubadour of stars with 11 or

more ranks in Perform can, as an additional bardic music effect,

inspire  powerful  hope  in  her  allies.  Good-aligned  creatures

within  30  feet  of  the  troubadour  who  are  her  allies  gain  a  +2

morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill

checks, and weapon damage rolls, as if affected by the good hope

spell.  In  addition,  affected  creatures  gain  a  new  saving  throw

against any fear effect, despair effect (such as the crushing despair

spell),  or  similar  mind-affecting  condition,  excluding  charm

person, dominate person, and similar spells. An affected creature

may use the troubadours Perform check result in place of her

saving  throw  if,  after  rolling  the  saving  throw,  the  Perform

check result proves to be better. Using the Words of Creation

with this ability increases the morale bonus to +4 and deals

11d4 points of nonlethal damage to the trou-

badour. Song of hope is a sonic, mind-affect-

ing ability.

Sanctified  Spells: A  6th-level  trouba-

dour  of  stars  can  use  sanctified  spells  as

though  they  were  among  her  spells

known.

Eladrin Form (Sp): At 7th level, a trou-

badour  of  stars  gains  the  ability  to  use

eladrin form, as the spell (see Chapter 6),

once per day. Her caster level is equal to

her class level.

Celestial  Symphony  (Su): A  9th-level

troubadour of stars with 15 or more ranks in

Perform  can,  as  an  additional  bardic

music  effect,  create  an  effect  that

duplicates  the  holy  word spell.

Nongood  creatures  within  30

feet of the troubadour are affected

as  though  by  the  spell.  The  trouba-

dours  caster  level  is  equal  to  her

class  level.  Using  the  Words  of  Cre-

ation with this effect grants the trou-

badour a +4 bonus on her

caster  level  check  to

overcome spell resistance

and  deals  15d4  points  of

nonlethal  damage  to

the  troubadour.  Celestial

symphony is a sonic effect.

Celestial Ascension (Ex): At 10th level, a troubadour of stars

is so attuned to the ways of the eladrins that she becomes a mag-

ical  creature.  Her  type  changes  to  outsider  (native)  and  she

gains damage reduction 10/unholy. Unlike other outsiders, the

troubadour can still be brought back from the dead.

VASSAL OF BAHAMUT

Most  of  Bahamuts  emissaries  and  champions  are  dutiful  and

mighty  metallic  dragons.  Occasionally,  however,  Bahamut

finds  a  nondraconic  champion  whose  reverence  of  good

dragons is unshakable, and whose hatred of evil dragons rivals

that of the purest gold dragonsa force of good so strong

that Bahamut feels moved to offer this champion a place

in his court.

A  vassal  of  Bahamut  is  a  devout,  nondraconic

champion in the service of the Dragon King. Vas-

sals  of  Bahamut  are  most  often

paladins,  although  fighters,

rangers,  and  barbarians  can

become  vassals  as  well.  The

road  to  becoming  a

Vassal  of  Bahamut  often

begins  with  the  character

undertaking  a  quest  for  a  good-

aligned  dragon,  and

then  assisting  good  dragons  over  a

period of time. If the champion wor-

ships  Bahamut  and  proves  himself

worthy by defeating a red dragon in

combat, Bahamut sends his avatar or

some other emissary to offer her the

opportunity to become a vassal. If the

character declines, Bahamut takes no

offense, allowing plenty of time for

the character to reconsider.

Vassals  of  Baha-

mut often work with

other  exalted  char-

acters,  particularly

groups  who  fre-

quently  oppose  evil

dragons  and  other

servants  of  Tiamat,

the  evil  dragon

queen. A vassal of Bahamut even deigns to cooperate with neu-

tral  characters  on  missions  against  evil  dragons,  although  he

might belittle them for their lack of convictions. The only time

a vassal of Bahamut works with evil characters is if he is infil-

trating their group and trying to bring down an evil dragon or

one of Tiamats agents.

Because  vassals  of  Bahamut  are  few  in  number  and  wide-

spread,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  two  vassals  of  Bahamut  ever

meet face-to-face.

Hit Die: d10.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A champion of Bahamut

is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of

armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Imperious Aura (Ex): Good dragons are naturally well-dis-

posed toward a vassal of Bahamut, while evil dragons are cowed

by his presence. The vassal of Bahamut gains a bonus equal to

his class level on all Charisma-based skill checks made against

dragons and dragon-type creatures (such as wyverns).

Platinum Armor: A vassal of Bahamut is granted the ability

to create platinum scale mail. The vassal starts with scales from

a slain juvenile (or older) red dragon and works them for 2 days

per  character  level.  During  this  time,  the  vassal  must  not

engage in any other activities other than eating and sleeping.

At the end of this period, the red dragon scales transform into

glistening platinum scales. The finished masterwork

suit of armor weighs 25 pounds and confers a

+8 armor bonus. Its other properties are as

a  masterwork  chain  shirt  (+4  max  Dex

bonus,  1  armor  check  penalty,  20%

arcane spell failure chance, no speed

reduction).

Only the vassal of Bahamut may

wear  the  platinum  armor,  which

instantly  corrodes  and  turns  to

powder  if  donned  by  another

creature. The vassal can replace a

lost suit using scales from a slain

juvenile (or older) red dragon, as

noted above, but can craft no more

than one such suit at a time.

The  vassals  platinum  armor  may

be enhanced using standard item cre-

ation feats.

Dragon  Senses  (Ex): Starting  at

2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut can see

four times as well as a human in low-light

conditions and twice as well as a human in normal light. He

also gains darkvision out to 120 feet.

Shared Trove: At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, a vassal of Bahamut

receives a modest lump sum reward for his loyal service. The

reward magically appears before the vassala mound of plat-

inum coins delivered straight from Bahamuts celestial treasure

vault.

The  number  of  platinum  pieces  equals  100   the  vassal  of

Bahamuts  character  level.  The  vassal  may  spend  the  money

more  or  less  as  he  sees  fit,  provided  the  expenditure  serves  a

good  or  righteous  cause.  If  the  money  is  spent  frivolously  or

unwisely, Bahamut sends a loyal representative (usually a gold

dragon in an alternate form) to demand repayment. Spending

the money to improve ones personal equipment is neither friv-

olous nor unwise.

Spells: Beginning at 2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut gains the

ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the

vassal must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spells level,

so a vassal with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.

Vassal  of  Bahamut  bonus  spells  are  based  on  Wisdom,  and

saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level +

the vassals Wisdom bonus. When the vassal gets 0 spells of a

given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 2nd-level vassal of

Bahamut), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to

based on his Wisdom score for that spell.

The vassal of Bahamuts spell list appears below. A vassal of

Bahamut prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a

beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Bonus  Feat: At  3rd  level,  and  again  at  6th  and  9th  level,  a

vassal of Bahamut gains a bonus feat. This feat must be drawn

from the following list, and the vassal must meet all the prereq-

uisites  for  the  feat:  Blind-Fight,  Cleave,  Combat  Reflexes,

Exalted  Smite*,  Gift  of  Faith*,  Gift  of  Grace*,  Great  Cleave,

Great Fortitude, Hands of a Healer*, Holy Radiance*, Improved

Bull  Rush,  Improved  Overrun,  Improved  Sunder,  Iron  Will,

Lightning  Reflexes,  Negotiator,  Nemesis*,  Nimbus

of  Light*,  Persuasive,  Power  Attack,

Righteous  Wrath*,  Sanctify  Weap-

on*, Weapon Focus.

New  feat  described  in  Chapter  4

of this book.

Dragonwrack (Su): Evil drag-

ons  that  strike  a  vassal  of

Bahamut  or  are  struck  by  him

suffer grievous wounds. At 4th

level, a vassal of Bahamut deals

+2d6  points  of  damage  with

each  successful  melee  attack

made against an evil creature of

the  dragon  type.  Furthermore,

any such creature that strikes the

vassal  with  a  natural  weapon  or

melee  weapon  takes  1d6  points  of

damage. In both cases, half of the extra

damage  is  permanent  hit  point  drain.

A  dragon  that  survives  a  battle  against  a

vassal of Bahamut often bears terrible scars from

the permanent drain of hit points. Only a wish or miracle

spell  can  restore  hit  points  drained  permanently  by  a  vassals

dragonwrack ability.

At  7th  level,  the  vassal  deals  +3d6  points  of  damage  to  evil

dragons, and a dragon that strikes the vassal takes 1d6 points of

damage. Again, in both cases, half of this damage is permanent

drain. At 10th level, the damage increases to +4d6 points and

2d6 points, respectively.

VASSAL OF BAHAMUT SPELL LIST

Vassals of Bahamut choose their spells from the following list:

1st  Level:  bless,  bless  weapon,  divine  favor,  endure  elements,

lantern light*, protection against evil, shield of faith.

2nd Level: align weapon, bears endurance, bulls strength, change

self, resist energy, shield other, undetectable alignment.

3rd  Level:  discern  lies,  magic  circle  against  evil,  protection  from

energy, refreshment*, searing light.

4th  Level:  dispel  evil,  divination,  divine  power,  holy  sword,

tongues.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

WONDERWORKER

Among  spellcasters  of  all  kinds,  some  are  so  devoted  to  the

cause of good that they sacrifice some of their spellcasting abil-

ity in order to grow closer to the ideal of goodness they revere.

These  are  wonderworkers,  practitioners  of  arcane  or  divine

magic (or even psionics) whose righteousness and purity sets

them apart from otherseven from other good clerics.

Like the sword of righteousness prestige class, the wonder-

worker class allows a spellcasting or psionic character to gain

more exalted feats at the cost of a slightly slower spell progres-

sion. Bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, wizards, psions,

and  psychic  warriors  can  all  adopt  this  class,

while  more  martially  oriented  characters

generally  choose  the  sword  of  right-

eousness  class  to  accomplish  the

same goal.

derworkers, though they are

often found operating in the

and  other  existing  organizations

devoted to virtuous causes.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a wonderworker, a

character  must  fulfill  all  the  following

criteria.

Alignment: Any good.

Base Save Bonus: Will +5.

Feats: One exalted feat, plus either Favored

of  the  Companions,  Knight  of  Stars,  or  Ser-

vant of the Heavens.

Spells: Able  to  cast  3rd-level  arcane  or

divine  spells,  or  to  manifest  3rd-level

psionic powers.

CLASS SKILLS

The  wonderworkers  class  skills  (and  the

key  ability  for  each  skill)  are  Concentration

(Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis),

Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Knowledge  (nature)

(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis),

Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter

4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Wonderworkers gain no

proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Bonus Exalted Feat: At every level, a wonderworker gets a

bonus  exalted  feat.  These  bonus  feats  must  be  drawn  from

among those identified as exalted feats in Chapter 4: Feats.

Bonus Spells per Day: For each level of wonderworker that

a  spellcasting  character  attains,  he  gains  bonus  spells  to  the

number of spells per day he normally casts. These bonus spells

can be added to whatever levels of spells the wonderworker can

currently cast, but no more than one can be added to

the  characters  highest  current  spell

level. Arcane spellcasters (bards, sor-

cerers,  and  wizards)  receive  fewer

bonus spells than divine spellcasters

(clerics  and  druids),  as  shown  on

the table above.

For example, a 9th-level cleric who

takes a single level in wonderworker

can  give  himself  one  bonus  5th-level  spell

(his highest as a 9th-level cleric), and one bonus

spell in one other level, 0 through 4th. A 9th-

level  wizard  who  takes  a  level  in  wonder-

worker  gains  only  one  bonus  spell,  which

she  can  give  herself  in  any  level,  0

through 5th.

A  psion  who  adopts  the  wonder-

worker  class  receives  bonus  power

points/day equal to one-half of the sum of

his psion level and his wonderworker level. A

psychic  warrior/wonderworker  receives

bonus power points/day equal to one-third of

the sum of her psychic warrior level and her

wonderworker level. If a wonderworker has

two  spellcasting  or  psionic  classes  already,

he  must  give  the  bonus  spell  or  power

points to a class in which he can cast at least

3rd-level spells or manifest at least 3rd-level

powers.  If  more  than  one  class  meets  that

requirement, he must choose which previous

class gains the bonus. He cannot split

bonus spells or power points between

two  different  spellcasting  or  psionic

classes.  For  example,  a  5th-level

cleric/5th-level wizard takes one level of

wonderworker.  He  can  either  take  2  bonus

cleric  spells  or  1  bonus  wizard  spell,  but  he

A wonderworker

cannot take 1 of each.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the wonderworker pres-

tige class.

Once a wonderworker has chosen how to apply his

bonus spells or power points, they cannot be shifted.

hite magic, holy power, celestial radiance: by any

name,  the  magic  of  good  is  no  less  powerful,

though  often  more  subtle,  than  the  dark  force

of evil.

GOOD SPELLS

Not many spells in the Players Handbook have the good descrip-

tor, but this book includes many more. Spells have the good

descriptor  because  they  do  one  or  more  of  the  following

things:

Good spells call upon good deities or energies.

Good  spells  summon  or  improve  celestials  or  other  good

creatures.

Good  spells  involve  a  personal  sacrifice  to  help  another.

Good spells inspire hope, joy, or similar positive emotions,

or they alleviate suffering.

WHATS GOOD?

Is casting a healing spell a good act? Often, it is: it relieves the

suffering of another creature, promoting the life and well being

of that creature. Healing spells do not carry the good descriptor,

however,  because  their  moral  weight  depends  heavily  on  cir-

cumstances. Healing a blackguard so he can continue to fight a

good party is not a good act at all. Like most spells, healing spells

can be used for good or evil purposes, so they are not inherently

good.

As  a  variant  rule,  consider  the  following  spells  from

the  Players  Handbook to  have  the  good  descriptor:  good

hope and shield other.

SANCTIFIED MAGIC

For those willing to utterly devote themselves to good,

great  power  awaits  in  the  form  of  sanctified  magic.

These spells require a great sacrifice from the caster in

exchange for powerful results.

Spellcasters prepare sanctified spells just as they do

regular spells, and casters who do not prepare spells

(including sorcerers and bards) cannot make use of

them except from a scroll. Evil characters cannot cast

sanctified  spells,  including  ones  cast  from  magic

items.

A sanctified spell usually has no material compo-

nents  (exceptions  are  noted).  Instead,  it  draws

power  from  the  sacrifice  of  the  spellcaster  in  the

form of ability damage, ability drain, or occasion-

ally greater sacrifices (a level or even the casters

life). The sacrifice occurs when the spells duration

expires.  (No  sanctified  spell  has  a  permanent

duration.)

If  a  sanctified  spell  is  made  into  a  potion,  scroll,

wand,  or  some  other  magic  item,  the  user  of  the

item  makes  the  sacrifice,  not  the  creator.  (The

creator  still  pays  the  XP  cost  and  gp  cost  for

83

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  9:43 AM  Page 84

creating the item.) This sacrifice, specified in the spells descrip-

tive text, is paid each time the item is used.

Sanctified spells are specific to no character class. They are nei-

ther inherently arcane nor divine spells. A divine caster casting a

sanctified spell casts it as a divine spell, while an arcane caster casts

it as an arcane spell.

While wizards, druids, rangers, and paladins can all prepare

sanctified spells, clerics have a special advantage: they can spon-

taneously  cast  any  sanctified  spell,  just  as  they  can  sponta-

neously cast cure wounds spells.

SPELL LISTS

This  section  begins  with  a  list  of  sanctified  spells,  which  are

available  to  any  class  that  prepares  spells  rather  than  casting

them spontaneously. Following the sanctified spells are lists of

new spells for the bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer,

and wizard classes. Each spells effect is summarized here, with

all  the  details  provided  in  the  spell  descriptions  that  follow.

An  M or  F appearing at the end of a spells name in the spell

lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respec-

tively,  that  is  not  normally  included  in  a  spell  component

pouch. An X denotes a spell with an XP component paid by the

caster.

with  the  given  domain,  whether  or  not  that  cleric  worships  a

specific deity.

The caster opens a portal to one of the

good-aligned  outer  planes  and  calls

forth  celestials  to  aid  in  battle  against

the most fearsome forces of evil.

The spell takes place over a period of

time. The first round, 2d4 avorals arrive.

Two  rounds  later,  a  ghaele  eladrin

arrives  to  join  the  fight.  Two  rounds

later, an astral deva arrives. Once these

creatures  appear,  they  serve  the  caster

for the duration of the spell. The spells

duration  begins  the  instant  the  first

damage  equal  to  that  listed  plus  its

Charisma  bonus.  An  evil  elemental  or

evil  undead  takes  an  extra  1  point  of

damage, and an evil outsider or an evil

cleric  of  an  evil  deity  takes  an  extra  2

points.  The  DC  listed  is  for  the  subse-

Amber Sarcophagus

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 day/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You infuse an amber sphere with magi-

cal power and hurl it toward the target.

If you succeed on a ranged touch attack,

the  amber  strikes  the  target  and

envelops  it  in  coruscating  energy  that

hardens  immediately,  trapping  the

target  within  a  translucent,  immobile

amber shell. The target is perfectly pre-

served and held in stasis, unharmed yet

unable  to  take  any  actions.  Within  the

amber sarcophagus, the target is protected

against  all  attacks,  including  purely

mental ones.

The amber sarcophagus has hardness 5

and  10  hp  per  caster  level  (maximum

200 hp). If it is reduced to 0 hp, it shat-

ters  and  crumbles  to  worthless  amber

dust,  at  which  point  the  target  is

released from stasis (although it is flat-

footed until its next turn). Left alone, the

amber sarcophagus traps the target for the

duration  of  the  spell,  then  disappears

before releasing the target from captive

stasis.

Material Component: An amber sphere

worth at least 500 gp.

Armageddon summons the wrath of heaven.

celestials appear. At the end of the spells

duration, all summoned celestials disap-

pear at once.

The celestials only heed the summons

if  the  caster  is  of  good  alignment  and

there  are  evil  foes  to  fight.  After  their

arrival,  the  celestials  obey  the  caster

explicitly  and  never  attack  her,  even  if

someone  else  manages  to  gain  control

over them. The caster does not need to

concentrate to maintain control over the

celestials.  She  can  dismiss  them  singly

or in groups at any time.

Sacrifice: 1 character level.

Target: One corporeal creature of

lawful or neutral alignment that is

native to the Material Plane

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell transforms the target into an

axiomatic  creaturea  perfect  version

of  itself.  The  spell  rids  the  creature  of

noticeable flaws, makes its fur or scales

appear  shinier,  and  so  forth.  Animals

touched  by  this  spell  become  magical

beasts, but otherwise the creatures type

is unchanged. If the target has an Intel-

ligence of 2 or less, the spell imbues the

target with an Intelligence of 3.

As  an  axiomatic  creature,  the  target

gains the following special attack:

Smite Chaos (Su): Once per day, the

target can make a normal attack to deal

extra damage equal to its HD total (max-

imum +20) against a chaotic opponent.

The target gains the following special

quality:

Linked  Minds  (Ex):  The  target  can

communicate  telepathically  with  other

axiomatic creatures of its type within 300

feet. If one in the group is not flat-footed,

none of them are, and no axiomatic crea-

ture in the group is considered flanked

unless they all are.

The target also gains darkvision with

a range of 60 feet, spell resistance equal

to  double  its  HD  (maximum  25),  and

resistance to cold, electricity, fire, and

sonic attacks based on its HD, as shown

evil  creatures,  dealing  1d6  points  of

damage per two caster levels (maximum

damage, which is of divine origin.

A  nimbus  of  light  surrounds  you,  pro-

tecting  you  and  those  around  you  from

spell effects and the attacks of evil crea-

tures. The aura excludes all spell effects of

up to 3rd level, exactly as a minor globe of

invulnerability does.  In  addition,  the

nimbus protects creatures within it as a

magic circle against evil at double strength.

Warded  creatures  gain  a  +4  deflection

bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on

saves against attacks from evil creatures,

and they are protected from possession,

mental  control,  and  bodily  contact  by

summoned or conjured creatures.

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

This  spell  makes  your  eyes  glow  with

white  light  and  allows  you  to  see  evil

auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is

similar to a detect evil spell, but does not

require concentration and discerns aura

location  and  strength  more  quickly.

You know the location and strength of

all evil auras within your sight. An auras

strength  depends  on  the  type  and  Hit

Dice of any evil creature, as noted in the

description of the detect evil spell in the

blindness spell.  During  the  duration  of

the  spell,  you  can  suppress  or  resume

this effect as a free action, while remain-

ing stunningly attractive.

stain  from  sexual  intercourse  for  one

week before casting this spell.

tered on you

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

A  brilliant  radiance  spreads  from  you,

brightly illuminating the area. The light

is similar to that created by the daylight

spell, but no magical darkness counters

or  dispels  it.  Furthermore,  evil-aligned

creatures  are  blinded  within  this  light.

Blinding glory brought into an area of

magical darkness (or vice versa), includ-

ing  an  utterdark spell,  is  temporarily

negated, so that the otherwise prevailing

light conditions exist in the overlapping

areas of effect.

directly  to  a  target  creature  within

range.  You  must  transfer  at  least  20

points.  Transferred  hit  points  are

damage to you. The creature takes your

transferred  hit  points  as  if  receiving  a

cure wounds spell and cannot gain more

hit points than its maximum allows; any

excess points are lost. This spell transfers

only actual hit points, not temporary hit

points. An unconscious target is consid-

ered a willing creature for purposes of

this spell.

from  Elysium  to  your  location.  They

serve  you  for  up  to  one  year  as  guards,

soldiers,  spies,  or  whatever  other  holy

purpose you have.

No matter how many times you cast

this spell, you can control no more than

2 HD worth of celestials per caster level.

If you exceed this number, all the newly

called creatures fall under your control,

and  any  excess  servants  from  previous

below.  As  a  free  action,  the  target  can

choose a different celestial trait, but the

target  cannot  change  traits  more  than

once during a given round.

Armblade  of  the  Sword  Archon:

One of the targets arms reshapes into a

blade that functions as a +1 flaming long-

sword or  +1  holy  longsword (casters

choice). The  caster  may  also  choose  to

create  a  short  sword  version  instead  of

the  normal

longsword-

sized  blade.

The  target

cannot  be

anything  in

the  affected

arm,  and  the

a r m b l a d e

cannot  be  dis-

armed  or  sun-

dered.

at it (no attack roll required).

Horns  of  the  Cervidal: Ramlike

horns sprout from the targets head. The

target can charge an opponent with its

deadly horns. In addition to the normal

benefits  and  hazards  of  a  charge,  this

tactic  allows  the  creature  to  make  a

single gore attack that deals 1d8 points

of  damage  plus  1-1/2  times  the  targets

Strength  modifier.  Any  summoned  or

called  creature  struck  by  the  horns  is

dismissed instantly.

Wings  of  the  Astral  Deva: Angelic

wings  sprout  from  the  targets  back,

allowing  the  target  to  fly  at  a  speed  of

100 feet (good).

Although these attributes change the

targets  appearance,  other  celestials  do

not  recognize  the  target  as  a  celestial

being  (unless  the  target  happens  to  be

one).  If  the  creature  tries  to  disguise

itself  as  a  celestial,  consult  the  Players

Handbook for  the  appropriate  Disguise

check DC.

Sacrifice: 1d3  points  of  Strength

The  target  can  assume  one  of  several

celestial  traits,  chosen  from  selection

The object touched sheds light brighter

than bright sunlight, channeled directly

from  the  celestial  realms.  The  light

extends to a 120-foot radius: bright light

to  60  feet  and  dim  light  in  another  60

feet.

Creatures  with  light  sensitivity  take

twice  the  usual  penalty  when  they  are

each  round  they  are  within  the  bright

light.  Evil  outsiders,  as  well  as  undead

creatures that are specifically harmed by

sunlight, take 2d6 points of damage each

round in the bright light.

Celestial brilliance brought into an area

of  magical  darkness  (or  vice  versa)  is

temporarily  negated,  so  that  the  other-

wise prevailing light conditions exist in

the overlapping areas of effect.

Celestial  brilliance counters  or  dispels

caster level 20th).

Evil  creatures  within  the  spells  area

that  fail  a  Will  save  take  a  2  morale

penalty on attack rolls and saves against

fear effects for the duration of the spell.

Creatures  must  be  able  to  hear  the

laugh  to  be  affected  by  the  spell.  Crea-

You invite a celestial creature to occupy

your body, as described in the section on

Celestial Channeling in Chapter 2. The

celestial must be present when you cast

the spell, it must be willing, and it cannot

have more than 12 HD. It need not have

the innate spell-like ability to channel its

power  through  mortals;  this  spell  be-

stows  that  ability  upon  the  celestial.

If  you  channel  a  celestial  that  was

summoned  to  the  Material  Plane  by

means  of  a  summon  monster or  similar

spell,  the  channeling  ends  when  the

duration of the summoning spell ends,

regardless of any remaining duration on

the channel celestial spell.

You  call  upon  the  heavenly  powers  to

bind  a  creature  in  writhing  chains  of

scintillating light. The creature is entan-

gled, taking a 2 penalty on attack rolls

and  a  4  penalty  to  effective  Dexterity.

Moreover,  the  chains  are  anchored  to

the nearest immobile object (usually the

caster  (as  a  free  action)  commands  the

chains  not  to  deal  damage  during  any

given round.

The  constricting  chains have  AC  20,  5

hp per caster level (maximum 100 hp),

and  damage  reduction  10/magic.  They

are  immune  to  energy-based  attacks,

nonlethal damage, and all spells except

dispel magic and similar effects. They are

not  subject  to  critical  hits.  Half  of  all

damage  dealt  to  the  chains  (rounded

down) is transferred to the target.

A  successful  DC  32  Strength  check

breaks the chains and ends the spell. An

entangled  creature  can  also  attempt  to

escape  (requiring  1  minute)  with  a  DC

40 Escape Artist check.

Focus: A  small  silver  chain  (10  gp).

Sacrifice: 1d2 points of Strength drain.

rounds  your  head.  Creatures  you

engage  in  melee  combat  must  make

be  blinded  for  1d4  rounds.  Creatures

that  successfully  save,  and  creatures

that have recovered from blindness, are

still dazzled for as long as they remain

in melee with you.

Creatures  with  light  sensitivity  and

creatures  that  are  harmed  by  sunlight

(such  as  vampires)  must  make  a  Will

This spell temporarily bestows the aura

of  celestial  authority  on  you,  inspiring

awe  in  all  lesser  creatures  who  behold

your  terrible  perfection  and  righteous-

ness. Creatures with fewer than 8 levels

or  Hit  Dice  cease  whatever  they  are

doing  and  turn  to  face  you. When  you

speak, your words are treated as a sugges-

tion spell, and the listeners telepathically

understand  you,  even  if  they  do  not

understand your language.

Creatures  who  make  successful

saving throws are not awed by you and

can  continue  their  actions  normally.

Creatures with more than 8 HD are im-

Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You draw forth the material essence of joy

from a creature experiencing great bliss.

This physical manifestation of joy, called

ambrosia, can be used in the creation of

good magic items, as a special spell com-

ponent, or as a druglike substance (with

no addictive qualities). The Celestial Heb-

domad, the rulers of the Seven Heavens,

subsist entirely on ambrosia.

The  caster  draws  ambrosia  from  the

target  and  contains  it  within  a  tiny

receptacle, such as a vial. Ambrosia can

only be drawn from a blissful creature;

how  the  creature  achieves  this  state  of

bliss can vary from one individual to the

next. For example, distilled joy can be cast

on  a  deliriously  lovestruck  character,  a

dryad dreaming near her tree, an artist

crafting his lifes masterpiece, or a char-

acter experiencing a moment of rapture

or undiluted sexual pleasure.

Good spellcasters can use ambrosia in

magic item creation. Each dose provides

the  equivalent  of  2  experience  points

needed  to  create  the  item.  A  dose  of

ambrosia can also be used as an optional

spell component (see Chapter 3).

A living creature that drinks a dose of

ambrosia experiences a soothing sensa-

tion  that  wipes  away  minor  aches  and

pains,  takes  the  edge  off  grief  and  sad-

ness, and cures 1 point of damage. These

positive sensations and emotions persist

for 1d4+1 hours.

Focus: A  vial  or  similar  container  in

which to contain the ambrosia.

gering threads of magical energy for 1d6

rounds. An entangled creature takes a 2

penalty on attack rolls and a 4 penalty

to  effective  Dexterity;  the  entangled

target  can  move  at  half  speed  but  cant

run  or  charge.  An  entangled  creature

that  attempts  to  cast  a  spell  must  suc-

ceed on a DC 15 Concentration check or

A  blast  of  diamondlike  shards  springs

spell also deals 1d6 points of damage per

caster  level  (maximum  10d6).  The

damage  affects  only  evil  creatures.  A

successful  Reflex  save  reduces  the

This spell helps to tip the momentum of

combat  in  the  favor  of  good,  granting

limited precognitive ability that enables

the  spells  recipient  to  circumvent  the

defenses of evil opponents. The target of

the spell gains a +3 sacred bonus on all

attack rolls made against evil creatures.

This  bonus  does  not  apply  to  attacks

made against nonevil creatures.

Curtain of Light

Evocation [Light]

Level: Sanctified 5

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Curtain of light whose area is

up to one 5-ft. square/level

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

An  immobile,  vertical  curtain  of  bril-

liant light energy springs into existence.

This barrier cannot pass through spaces

occupied by creatures and objects, but it

can bend around them.

One  side  of  the  curtain,  selected  by

you, sends forth flashes of light, dealing

2d4  points  of  damage  to  evil  creatures

within 10 feet and 1d4 points of damage

to evil creatures past 10 feet but within

20  feet.  The  curtain  deals  this  damage

when  it  appears  and  at  the  start  of  the

casters turn each round. In addition, the

curtain  deals  2d6  points  of  damage  +1

point of damage per caster level (maxi-

mum  +20)  to  any  evil  creature  passing

through  it.  Contact  with  the  curtain

deals  double  damage  to  undead  crea-

tures.

A curtain of light can be made perma-

nent with a permanency spell. A perma-

nent curtain  of  light that  is  destroyed

becomes  inactive  for  10  minutes,  and

then  reforms.  Curtain  of  light counters

any  magical  darkness  spell  of  5th  level

or lower with which it comes into con-

tact.  Any  magical  darkness  spell  of  5th

level or higher counters curtain of light.

The curtain of light is impervious to all

physical  attacks  and  spells  except  anti-

magic  field,  dispel  magic,  greater  dispel

magic,  and  Mordenkainens  disjunction.

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level or until dis-

charged

You  can  sacrifice  life  force  to  increase

the damage you deal. When you cast the

spell, you can sacrifice up to 10 of your

hit points. For every 2 hp you sacrifice,

on your next successful attack you deal

+1d6 damage, to a maximum of +5d6 on

that attack. Your ability to deal this extra

damage  ends  when  you  successfully

attack or when the spell duration ends.

Sacrificed  hit  points  count  as  normal

Dolorous Motes

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-

Level: Bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Effect: 1 10-ft. cube/level

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  creates  flickering  motes  of

light that cause intense mental anguish.

Creatures  inside  or  passing  through  a

cloud of dolorous motes must succeed on a

Will save or be dazed for 1 round. A new

save may be made each round. Leaving

and  then  re-entering  a  cloud  of  motes

forces a new save.

The caster can create one large cloud

of  flickering  motes  or  several  smaller

clouds.  For  example,  a  5th-level  caster

could  create  five  separate  clouds,  each

filling  a  10-foot  cube  anywhere  within

the spells range. Conversely, the caster

can  group  one  or  more  10-foot-cubes

together to form larger clouds or barri-

ers. The affected cubes need not be adja-

cent  to  one  another,  but  each  cloud  is

stationary once placed.

Dragon Cloud

Ease Pain

Conjuration (Calling) [Air]

Level: Sanctified 8

Components: V, S, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Special (see text)

Effect: One conjured dragon cloud (see

text)

Duration: 1 min. + 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  must  cast  this  spell  outdoors,  in  a

place  where  clouds  are  visible.  It  calls

forth a spirit of elemental air, binds it to

a nearby cloud (either a normal cloud or

storm  cloud),  and  gives  it  a  dragonlike

form. Upon forming, the dragon-shaped

cloud swoops toward you, arriving in 1

minute regardless of the actual distance

from you. (The time it takes to reach you

counts  toward  the  spells  duration.)

Once  it  arrives,  you  can  command  the

dragon cloud like a summoned creature

(see the summon natures ally I spell in the

Players Handbook for details). The dragon

cloud speaks Auran.

At the end of the spells duration, the

dragon  cloud  evaporates  into  nothing-

ness  as  the  bound  elemental  spirit

returns  to  its  home  plane.  The  dragon

cloud  cannot  pass  through  liquids  or

solid objects.

Sacrifice: 1d3  points  of  Constitution

damage.

The dragon cloud has the following sta-

tistics:

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Ease pain immediately removes any lin-

gering effects of pain, including penal-

ties imposed by symbol of pain, angry ache,

and  similar  spells.  It  does  not  heal  any

damage  or  other  effects  not  directly

related to pain.

If  the  target  creature  is  under  some

effect that causes continuing damage, the

pain is eased only for a moment. Ease pain

cannot bypass the need for a Concentra-

tion check to cast a spell under such cir-

cumstances,  nor  can  it  allow  a  creature

subject to death by thorns to act normally

(since  the  spells  damage  is  ongoing).

Eladrin Form

Transmutation [Good]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

You assume the form of an incorporeal

globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diame-

ter. In this form, you can fly at a speed of

150  feet  with  perfect  maneuverability

and  can  pass  through  walls  and  other

solid objects. You can use any spell-like

or psionic abilities you possess, but you

cannot  cast  spells  or  make  physical

attacks.  The  globe  form  is  incorporeal,

and you have no Strength score while

in that form. While incorporeal, you can

be  harmed  only  by  other  incorporeal

creatures,  +1  or  better  magic  weapons,

psionics,  spells,  spell-like  abilities,  or

supernatural  abilities.  You  are  immune

to  all  nonmagical  attack  forms.  Even

when  hit  by  spells  or  magic  weapons,

you  have  a  50%  chance  to  ignore  any

damage from a corporeal source (except

for  positive  energy,  negative  energy,

force effects, or attacks made with ghost

touch weapons).

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 20-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  infuse  an  emerald  with  magical

power and it flies toward your enemies.

The  gemstone  explodes  on  impact,

releasing  a  coruscating  pulse  of  green

light. Neutral creatures within the burst

are  dazed  for  1  round.  Evil  creatures

within  the  burst  are  stunned  for  1d4

rounds. Good creatures within the burst

are unaffected.

Material Component: Emerald worth at

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

imposed by symbol of pain, angry ache, and

similar  spells.  It  neither  prevents

damage  nor  blocks  other  effects  not

directly related to pain (such as the recall

agony or recall pain psionic power).

The  spell  also  induces  a  pleasurable

fuguelike  state  that  yields  a  number  of

additional effects:

First,  empyreal  ecstasy renders  its  tar-

gets  immune  to  mind-affecting  spells

and  effects  for  the  spells  duration,  but

does  not  negate  mind-influencing  ef-

fects already in place.

Second, targets of the spell take only

half damage from all melee and ranged

attacks  for  the  duration  of  the  spell.

Third, the fuguelike state induced by

the spell makes it difficult for targets to

concentrate  on  certain  tasks.  Creatures

in ecstasy take a 4 penalty on all skill

checks, and casting a spell while under

the influence of empyreal ecstasy requires

a DC 15 Concentration check.

This  spell  creates  an  invisible  aura  of

divine  power  around  the  caster.  All

intelligent  creatures  within  the  spells

area  suddenly  become  aware  that  any

hostile  actions  they  take  will  be  met

with dire consequences.

Any  creature  in  the  spells  area  that

makes  an  attack  takes  20d6  points  of

damage. The caster decides whether the

spell  deals  lethal  or  nonlethal  damage

but  cannot  change  her  mind  once  the

spell  is  cast.  Creatures  with  multiple

attacks  take  the  damage  after  every

attack they make.

Targets  outside  the  area  of  the  spell

may  freely  attack  creatures  in  the  area

without taking damage from this spell.

Like  the  ease  pain spell,  empyreal  ecstasy

immediately  removes  any  lingering

Duration: 10 minutes/level or until

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  converts  magical  energy

damage into healing power. First, it ren-

ders  the  target  immune  to  one  energy

type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic)

specified when the spell is cast. Second,

whenever  the  target  is  subjected  to  a

magical  attack  of  the  selected  energy

type,  he  instead  heals  damage  equal  to

10%  of  the  damage  dealt  (rounded

down).  For  example,  a  creature  pro-

tected  by  energetic  healing (cold)  that

would  normally  take  35  points  of  cold

damage from a cone of cold heals 3 points

of damage instead. Once the spell heals a

number  of  hit  points  equal  to  2  per

caster  level  (maximum  30),  it  is  dis-

charged.

This spell does not convert nonmagi-

cal energy attacks (such as damage from

alchemists fire) into healing.

Saving Throw: Reflex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  transforms  a  magic  potion

into  a  volatile  substance  that  can  be

hurled out to the specified range. The

tricity, fire, or sonic) when the spell is

cast.

The potion deals 1d6 points of dam-

age  (of  the  appropriate  energy  type)

per spell level of the potion (maximum

3d6).  For  example,  a  potion  of  displace-

requires  a  standard  action  to  consume.

Any portion of the stew that is not con-

sumed disappears after 1 hour.

The stew can be splashed onto a single

undead  creature  within  10  feet.  If  a

amount of damage not taken by all the

warded creatures is taken by you. Forms

of harm that do not involve hit points,

such as charm effects, temporary ability

damage,  level  draining,  and  disintegra-

tion, are not affected. If a subject suffers

a reduction of hit points from a lowered

Constitution score, the reduction is not

split with you because it is not hit point

damage.  When  the  spell  ends,  subse-

quent  damage  is  no  longer  divided

between  you  and  the  subjects,  but

damage already split is not reassigned to

the subjects.

If you die while this spell is in effect,

the  spell  ends  in  a  burst  of  positive

energy  that  restores  1d8  hit  points  to

each subject.

If a subject moves out of range of the

spell, that subjects connection to you is

severed but the spell continues as long

as there is at least one subject remaining

and you remain alive.

Focus: A platinum ring (worth at least

50 gp) worn by you and each subject of

the spell.

This  spell  first  appeared  in  Magic  of

Faern.

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

As status (described in the Players Hand-

book),  but  you  can  also  cast  a  limited

selection of spells through the link, as if

cast  any  spell  that  meets  the  following

conditions:

Hammer of Righteousness

Evocation [Force, Good]

Level: Sanctified 3

Components: V, S, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Magic warhammer of force

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

A  great  warhammer  of  positive  energy

springs into existence, launches toward

a  target  that  you  can  see  within  the

range of the spell, and strikes unerringly.

The  hammer  of  righteousness  deals

1d6 points of damage per caster level to

the target, or 1d8 points of damage per

caster  level  if  the  target  is  evil.  The

caster  can  decide  to  deal  nonlethal

damage  instead  of  lethal  damage  with

the  hammer,  or  can  split  the  damage

evenly between the two types. How the

damage is split must be decided before

damage  is  rolled.  The  hammer  is  con-

sidered  a  force  effect  and  has  no  miss

chance  when  striking  an  incorporeal

target.  A  successful  Fortitude  save

halves the damage.

Sacrifice:  1d3  points  of  Strength

damage.

Healing Touch

You transfer some of your life essence to

another  creature,  healing  it.  You  may

heal up to 1d6 hit points per two caster

levels  (maximum  10d6),  and  must  de-

cide  how  many  dice  to  roll  when  you

cast the spell. You take damage equal to

the  amount  the  target  is  healed.  This

spell cannot restore more hit points to a

target than your current hit points +10,

which is enough to kill you.

Hearts Ease

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One creature/level

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Hearts  ease cures  emotional  wounds  in

the same way that heal wipes away phys-

ical ones. The subjects are cured of any

fear  effect,  despair  effect  (such  as  the

crushing  despair spell),  or  similar  mind-

affecting  condition,  excluding  charms

and compulsions (such as charm person,

dominate  person, and  similar  spells).  It

removes  any  lingering  psychological

effects  of  torture  (including  the  in-

creased effectiveness of torture devices,

as described in the Book of Vile Darkness).

It cures confusion and insanity, restores

2d4 points of Wisdom damage (but not

permanent  Wisdom  drain),  and  leaves

the  targets  feeling  refreshed  and  at

peace.

3d6 points of special celestial electric-

ity  damage.  Creatures  normally

ning is not subject to being reduced by

Target: One creature with an Intelli-

gence of 6 or more

Duration: See text

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

With this spell, the caster compels the

target creature to divulge information it

may be hiding. If the target fails its save,

it is forced to reply to the casters ques-

tions  (one  question  per  three  caster

levels),  speak  truthfully,  and  not  re-

spond  in  such  a  way  that  the  answers

provided may be misleading. The ques-

tions  posed  may  be  answered  with  a

simple yes or no, or they may require a

more  detailed  response.  This  spell

cannot  be  used  to  force  the  target  to

divulge  information  it  doesnt  know,

and the target creature is unable to fab-

Last Judgment

Necromancy [Death, Good]

Level: Cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8,

Wrath 8

Components: V, Celestial

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One evil humanoid, monstrous

humanoid, or giant/2 levels

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

Reciting a list of the targets evil deeds,

you call down the judgment of the heav-

ens upon their heads. Creatures that fail

their  saving  throw  are  struck  dead  and

bodily  transported  to  the  appropriate

Lower Plane to suffer their eternal pun-

ishment. Creatures that succeed never-

theless  take  3d6  points  of  temporary

Wisdom  damage  as  guilt  for  their  mis-

deeds overwhelms their minds.

This  spell  affects  only  humanoids,

monstrous humanoids, and giants of evil

alignment.

A true resurrection or miracle spell can

restore  life  to  a  creature  slain  by  this

spell normally. A resurrection spell works

only if the creatures body can be recov-

ered  from  the  Lower  Planes  before  the

resurrection is cast.

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  has  the  effect  of  a  holy  word,

and  it  additionally  deals  2d6  points  of

sonic  damage  to  nongood  creatures  in

the  area.  A  successful  Fortitude  saving

throw negates the sonic damage, but not

the other effects of the spell.

Lastais Caress

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Good,

Mind-Affecting]

Level: Cleric 2, Pleasure 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One known evil creature

touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your  gentle  touch  fills  the  target  with

tremendous  feelings  of  love  and  com-

passion, and has the power to unnerve

and  debilitate  evil  creatures.  You  must

succeed  on  a  melee  touch  attack  to

affect  an  unwilling  target.  It  has  no

effect  on  a  creature  that  you  do  not

know is evil.

An evil creature touched by the spell

must wrestle with the pleasant feelings

invoked  by  the  spell.  Roll  on  the  table

Luminous Armor

Abjuration

Level: Sanctified 2

Components: Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One good creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell, favored among eladrins visit-

ing  the  Material  Plane,  envelops  the

target in a protective, shimmering aura

of light. The luminous armor resembles a

suit  of  dazzling  full  plate,  but  it  is

weightless  and  does  not  restrict  the

targets  movement  or  mobility  in  any

way. In addition to imparting the bene-

fits of a breastplate (+5 armor bonus to

AC),  the  luminous  armor has  no  maxi-

mum  Dexterity  restriction,  no  armor

check penalty, and no chance for arcane

spell failure.

Luminous  armor sheds  light  equiva-

lent to a daylight spell and counters dark-

ness spells  of  2nd  level  or  lower  with

which it comes into contact. In addition,

the armors brightness causes opponents

to take a 4 to penalty on melee attacks

made  against  the  target.  This  penalty

stacks  with  the  attack  penalty  suffered

by  creatures  sensitive  to  bright  light

(such as dark elves).

Sacrifice: 1d2  points  of  Strength

damage.

Luminous Armor, Greater

Abjuration

Level: Sanctified 4

This spell functions like luminous armor,

except that it imparts the benefits of full

plate (+8 armor bonus to AC).

Sacrifice: 1d3  points  of  Strength

damage.

Mind Bond

Divination

Level: Paladin 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: Special mount

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You temporarily strengthen the mental

bond with your special mount, allowing

you  and  your  special  mount  to  predict

each others movements and gain a sig-

nificant  edge  in  combat.  You  and  your

mount  gain  a  +4  flanking  bonus  on

attack rolls (instead of +2) when the two

of you are flanking the same opponent.

Furthermore,  your  mount  gains  a  +1

competence  bonus  on  attack  rolls  for

every  three  paladin  levels  you  possess

(maximum  +5)  for  the  duration  of  the

spell  as  long  as  it  remains  within  the

spells range.

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

When  you  cast  this  spell  and  touch  a

creature that is under the influence of a

mind-affecting spell or effect, that crea-

ture  immediately  receives  another

DC to break free of the effect. If the spell

or  effect  did  not  originally  permit  a

Path of the Exalted

Divination

Level: Sanctified 3

Components: V, Abstinence

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Duration: 1 decision; see text

Path of the exalted allows the caster to con-

sult her deity (or an agent of her deity) to

help make a difficult decision. This deci-

sion  is  usually  more  com-

plex than a simple morality

question.  It  may  involve

strategizing, choosing a par-

ticular lead to follow in an

investigation,  deciding

who to help, or other

difficult choices.

The  deity  or

agent simply helps

the character exam-

ine  a  known

situation  from

a number of differ-

ent  angles  and

makes  a  recom-

mendation  about  the  cor-

rect  path  to  take.  This  spell

does  not  reveal  unknown  fac-

tors, but merely helps the caster

analyze  known  elements.  The

spell ends when the deity or agent

has provided sufficient guidance for

the caster to arrive at a decision.

If  the  caster  is  out  of  favor  with  her

deity, this spell may not work until the

caster atones.

Abstinence Component: The caster

must abstain from casting Divination

spells for 24 hours prior to the casting

of this spell.

Perfect Summons

Transmutation [Good]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 40-ft.-radius spread

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You create an area in which only good crea-

tures  can  be  magically  summoned.  No

matter  what  a  later  caster  attempts  to

summon, he actually summons a good ver-

sion (a celestial beast rather than a fiendish

one, for example) or a good equivalent (an

archon rather than a formian).

If  the  summoner  was  attempting  to

summon a neutral or evil creature, the

good creature that appears is not bound

an erinyes.

to  obey  the  commands  of  the  sum-

moner or attack his enemies. Instead, it

deals  with  the  summoner  as  it  sees

fitpossibly  attacking  an  evil  caster.

The  summoning  spell  cannot  be  dis-

missed,  though  it  can  be  dispelled.  A

perfect  summons spell  can  also  be  dis-

pelled normally.

Perfect  summons counters  and  dispels

distort summons (which appears in Book of

Vile Darkness), and vice versa.

20 feet high and 30 feet in diameter. You

die  (no  saving  throw,  and  spell  resist-

ance does not apply). Every evil creature

within  the  cloud  takes  2d6  points  of

damage  per  caster  level  (maximum

40d6).  Neutral  characters  take  half

damage  (and  a  successful  Reflex  save

reduces that further in half ), while good

characters take no damage at all. Half of

the damage dealt by the spell against any

creature  is  fire;  the  rest  results  directly

from divine power and is therefore not

subject to being reduced by resistance to

fire-based  attacks,  such  as  that  granted

by  protection  from  energy  (fire),  fire  shield

(chill shield), and similar magic.

After  10  minutes,  you  rise  from  the

ashes as if restored to life by a resurrection

spell.

Radiant Fog

Conjuration (Creation, Good)

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (see

text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (see text)

As  solid  fog,  but  the  cloud  of  fog  shim-

mers  with  brilliant  celestial  radiance.

Creatures  within  the  cloud  must  make

successful Fortitude saves or be dazzled,

taking a 1 penalty on attack rolls for as

long as they remain in the cloud and for

1 minute afterward. Creatures with light

sensitivity  or  otherwise  susceptible  to

bright light are blinded if they fail their

saves.  Sightless  creatures  are  not

affected by the radiance.

Spell resistance applies to the reduced

movement,  melee  attack  and  damage

penalties,  and  dazzling  or  blinding

effects, but not to the concealment pro-

vided  or  the  prevention  of  ranged

weapon attacks.

Abstinence  Component: You  must  not

have  cast  a  darkness  or  Necromancy

spell  within  the  past  24  hours  before

casting this spell.

Radiant Shield

Evocation [Electricity, Good]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4, Wrath 4

Components: V, S, Abstinence

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

A  scintillating  aura  of  white  radiance

wreathes you and causes damage to each

creature that attacks you in melee. The

radiance also protects you from electric-

ity attacks.

Any creature striking you with a nat-

ural or handheld weapons deals normal

damage  but  also  takes  1d6  points  of

electricity  damage  +  1  point  per  caster

level  (the  creatures  spell  resistance

applies).

You take only half damage from elec-

tricity-based  attacks.  If  an  electricity-

based attack allows a Reflex save for half

damage,  you  take  no  damage  on  a  suc-

The  radiance  is  as  bright  as  a  light

spell,  casting  bright  light  in  a  10-foot

radius  and  shadowy  illumination  to  20

feet.

Abstinence  Component: You  must  not

have  cast  a  darkness  or  Necromancy

spell within the last 24 hours before cast-

Rain of Black Tulips

Evocation [Good]

Level: Druid 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: Cylinder (80-ft. radius, 80 ft.

high)

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None (damage) and

Fortitude negates (nausea)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Tulips as black as midnight fall from the

sky.  The  tulips  explode  with  divine

energy upon striking evil creatures, each

of which takes 5d6 points of damage. In

addition, evil creatures that fail a Forti-

tude  save  are  nauseated  (unable  to

attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells,

perform  any  task  requiring  concentra-

tion, or take anything other than a single

move  action  per  turn)  until  they  leave

the  spells  area.  A  successful  Fortitude

save  renders  a  creature  immune  to  the

nauseating  effect  of  the  tulips,  but  not

the damage.

Material  Component: A  black  tulip.

Rain of Embers

Evocation [Fire, Good]

Level: Sanctified 7

Components: V, S, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: Cylinder (40-ft. radius, 120 ft.

high)

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Reflex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell causes orange, starlike embers

to rain steadily from above. Each round,

the  falling  embers  deal  10d6  points  of

damage  to  evil  creatures  within  the

spells  area.  Half  of  the  damage  is  fire

damage,  but  the  other  half  results

directly from divine power and is there-

fore  not  subject  to  being  reduced  by

resistance  to  fire-based  attacks,  such  as

that  granted  by  protection  from  energy

(fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar

magic.  Creatures  may  leave  the  area  to

avoid  taking  additional  damage,  but  a

new  saving  throw  is  required  each

round  a  creature  is  caught  in  the  fiery

downpour.

A  shield  provides  a  cover  bonus  on

the  Reflex  save,  depending  on  its  size:

small +2, large +4, tower +7. A shield spell

oriented  upward  provides  a  +4  cover

bonus  on  the  Reflex  save.  A  creature

using its shield (or shield spell) to block

the  rain  of  embers cannot  use  it  for

defense in combat.

Sacrifice: 1d2 points of Strength drain.

Area: Cylinder (80-ft. radius, 80 ft.

high)

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None (ability damage)

and Fortitude negates (sickening)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Red roses fall from the sky. Their sharp

thorns graze the flesh of evil creatures,

dealing  1d4  points  of  temporary

Wisdom damage per round. A creature

reduced to 0 Wisdom falls unconscious

as its mind succumbs to horrible night-

mares.  In  addition,  the  beautiful  rose

petals  sicken  evil  creatures  touched  by

them; those that fail a Fortitude save are

sickened  (2  penalty  on  attack  rolls,

weapon  damage  rolls,  saving  throws,

ability  checks,  and  skill  checks)  until

they  leave  the  spells  area.  A  successful

Fortitude  save  renders  a  creature  im-

mune  to  the  sickening  effect  of  the

roses, but not the ability damage caused

by their thorns.

Material Component: A red rose.

druid 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Remove addiction cures all addictions that

the target suffers from (see Drugs in the

Book  of Vile  Darkness for  more  informa-

tion about addictions). Since the spells

duration  is  instantaneous,  it  does  not

prevent new addiction to the same drug

at a later date.

Remove Fatigue

Components: S

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Up to one living creature

touched per two levels

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The creatures you touch gain the bene-

fits of 8 hours of restful sleep. If a subject

was  fatigued,  the  fatigue  and  its  penal-

ties  are  removed.  If  a  subject  was  ex-

hausted,  the  exhaustion  becomes

fatigue,  but  the  subject  only  needs  to

rest  for  1  more  hour  to  eliminate  the

fatigue.  If  a  subject  was  already  well

rested, it does not need to rest or sleep

during the next 24 hours. Arcane spell-

casters must still rest their minds for 8

hours in order to prepare or ready their

spells.

Duration: Instantaneous

If the target of this spell has lost a valu-

able item as the result of the spell souls

treasure lost (described in the Book of Vile

Darkness),  this  spell  restores  that  item.

This spell must be cast within 4 hours of

the destruction of the item. Upon com-

pletion of the casting, the disintegrated

item  returns  to  the  possession  of  the

original owner in the condition it was in

before being disintegrated.

Righteous Smite

Evocation [Good]

Level: Cleric 7, exalted arcanist 7,

Wrath 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 20-ft. radius spread

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  draw  down  holy  power  to  smite

your  enemies.  Only  evil  and  neutral

creatures are harmed by the spell; good

creatures are unaffected.

The spell deals 1d6 points of damage

per caster level (maximum 20d6) to evil

creatures  (or  1d8  points  of  damage  per

caster level, maximum 20d8, to evil out-

siders) and blinds them for 1d4 rounds.

A successful Will saving throw reduces

damage to half and negates the blinding

effect.

The  spell  deals  only  half  damage

against  creatures  that  are  neither  good

nor evil, and they are not blinded. They

can reduce that damage by half (down to

one-quarter of the roll) with a successful

Will save.

Sacred Guardian

Divination

Level: Apostle of peace 5, cleric 5

Components: V, S, Celestial

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Object or willing creature

touched

Duration: 1 day/level

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Celestials use sacred guardian to monitor

the location and condition of a creature

or  object  that  has  been  placed  in  their

care.  Similar  to  status, this  spell  makes

the caster constantly aware of the target

creature or objects precise location and

status: whether a creature is unharmed,

wounded,  disabled,  staggered,  uncon-

scious,  dying,  dead,  and  so  on,  or

whether  an  object  is  unharmed,  dam-

aged, or destroyed. Once the spell is cast,

the distance between the caster and the

subject does not affect the spell, and the

spell  continues  to  function  even  if  the

subject and caster are on different planes

of existence.

If the caster wishes to teleport to the

subjects presence, he can do so even if

he  is  not  familiar  with  the  location

(assuming he has access to teleportation

magic).  If  the  caster  casts  scrying or

greater scrying on the subject, the subject

does not receive a saving throw; unless

the  subject  is  warded  by  a  spell  or  in  a

location  that  blocks  scrying  magic,  the

spell automatically succeeds.

This spell has no effect on unwilling

creatures.  If  the  target  is  an  attended

object,  the  attending  creature  must  be

willing for the object to receive the spell.

Sacred Haven

Abjuration

Level: Paladin 4

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You shield one creature in a nimbus of

holy light. The creature gains a +2 sacred

bonus to Armor Class. In addition, while

protected by this spell, the creature does

not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC when

flat-footed.

For the duration of the spell, you gain

awareness of the targets health as with

the status spell, and you need not be able

to touch the target to heal it with your

lay  on  hands  ability.  Use  of  the  lay  on

hands  ability  still  requires  a  standard

action,  but  it  can  be  done  at  any  range

provided the target is on the same plane

of existence as you.

Sanctify the Wicked

Necromancy [Good]

Level: Sanctified 9

Components: V, S, F, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One evil creature

Duration: See text

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell tears the foul, corrupted soul

from  the  body  of  an  evil  creature  and

traps  it  in  a  diamond  receptacle  (the

spells  focus).  The  creatures  soulless

body  instantly  withers  or  molders  into

dust.

Trapped  in  the  gem,  the  evil  soul

undergoes a gradual transformation. The

soul  reflects  on  past  evils  and  slowly

finds  within  itself  a  spark  of  goodness.

Over time, this spark grows into a burn-

ing fire. After one year, the trapped crea-

tures  soul  adopts  the  alignment  of  the

spells caster (lawful good, chaotic good,

or  neutral  good).  Once  the  souls  peni-

tence  is  complete,  shattering  the  dia-

mond  reforms  the  creatures  original

body, returns the creatures soul to it, and

transforms  the  whole  into  a  sanctified

creature (see Chapter 8: Monsters).

If  the  diamond  is  shattered  before

the  soul  has  found  penitence,  the  evil

creatures  body  and  soul  are  fully  re-

stored; the creatures state is just as it was

before  the  spell  was  cast.  The  creature

retains  the  memory  of  having  been

trapped  in  the  gem,  and  it  regards  the

spells caster as a hated enemy who must

be destroyed at all costs.

The  diamond  receptacle  has  a  hard-

ness of 20 and 1 hit point.

Focus:  A  flawless  diamond  worth  no

less than 10,000 gp.

Sacrifice: 1 character level.

This spell turns your holy symbol into a

magical  receptacle  capable  of  holding

one  creatures  corpse. The  corpse  must

be  within  range  of  the  spell,  in  which

case it is transformed into divine energy.

The energy is then drawn into the holy

symbol, and the corpse is placed in stasis

(as the gentle repose spell) for the duration

of the spell.

The caster can release the corpse from

the holy symbol by dismissing the spell.

If the spell ends or is dismissed, or if the

holy symbol is destroyed, the contained

corpse materializes in a square adjacent

to the holy symbols present or last loca-

tion.

Shield of the Archons

Abjuration [Good]

Level: Apostle of peace 7, cleric 7

Components: V, Archon

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Effect: Mobile shield

Duration: 1 round/level

A  mystic  shield  of  beneficent  energies

interposes itself between you an incom-

ing  magical  attack.  The  shield  blocks

harmful  spells,  spell-like  abilities,  and

supernatural abilities. It can only block

one  such  attack  each  round,  intercept-

ing  the  first  but  not  any  later  attacks

until your next turn.

Any  targeted  magical  attack  that

strikes the shield is dissipated, but it has

a 5% chance per spell level to shatter the

shield as well. Attacks with no spell level

have  a  5%  chance  per  2  caster  levels  to

shatter the shield. An attack that shatters

the shield is dissipated without harming

you.

If you are within the area or effect of a

harmful  spell  or  effect  that  is  not

directly targeted on you, the shield of the

archons grants  you  a  +4  bonus  on  your

saving throw against the effect.

Silvered Claws

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell allows the target to treat all of

its  natural  attacks  as  silvered  weapons.

The  spell  affects  slam  attacks,  fist  or

claw attacks, bite attacks, and any other

natural weapons the target creature pos-

sesses.  The  spell  does  not  change  an

unarmed strikes damage from nonlethal

damage to lethal damage, however.

Silvered claws can be made permanent

with a permanency spell.

Silvered Weapon

Transmutation

Level: Paladin 1, ranger 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One weapon or projectile

touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(object, harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object, harm-

less)

This spell transforms a single weapon or

projectile you are holding into a silvered

weapon.  The  weapon  may  be  magical,

masterwork, or nonmagical, but it must

be  in  hand  when  the  spell  is  cast.  You

cant cast this spell on a natural weapon,

such as an unarmed strike (instead, see

silvered claws).

The spell cannot be cast on more than

one  weapon  or  on  multiple  projectiles.

If the weapon targeted by the spell is

made  of  another  special  material  (cold

iron  or  adamantine,  for  example),  it

loses the benefits of its original special

material for the spells duration.

Silvered  weapon can  be  made  perma-

nent with a permanency spell.

Smite Heretic

Conjuration

For the duration of the spell, when using

your  smite  evil  class  ability  against  an

evil  creature  with  the  ability  to  cast

divine spells, you gain a +2 sacred bonus

on  the  attack  roll.  Furthermore,  the

attack  deals  2  extra  points  of  damage

(instead of 1) per paladin level.

Spear of Valarian

Level: Beloved of Valarian 4, druid 5,

ranger 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One nonmagical weapon

touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(object, harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object, harm-

less)

The  spear  of  Valarian spell  transforms

one  nonmagical  weapon  into  a  shim-

mering silver spear. You must be carry-

ing  the  weapon  and  have  it  drawn  for

the spell to work.

The shimmering spear functions as a

+1 silvered spear. Against magical beasts,

the  weapon  becomes  a  +3  silvered  spear

that deals +2d6 points of bonus damage

(as the bane special property).

If the spear of Valarian is sundered, the

original weapon breaks as the spell sud-

denly  ends.  If  the  wielder  relinquishes

the  spear,  willingly  or  not,  it  immedi-

ately reverts to its previous state and the

spell ends.

Effect: 10 ft./level-radius spread

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

This spell has a calming effect on crea-

tures within the spells area. Hostile and

unfriendly  creatures  become  indiffer-

ent,  indifferent  creatures  turn  friendly,

and  friendly  creatures  become  helpful

for the spells duration.

This spell directly counters the effects

of the spread of savagery spell (described in

the Book of Vile Darkness). This spell also

calms creatures that have been otherwise

magically enraged and forced to attack.

This  spell  does  not  calm  or  other-

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell manifests as a draping cloak

of  tiny,  cascading  stars  that  seem  to

flicker out before touching the ground.

The  cloak  forms  over  the  targets  exist-

ing  apparel  and  sheds  light  as  a  torch,

although this is not the mantles primary

function.

The  starmantle renders  the  wearer

impervious  to  nonmagical  weapon

attacks and transforms any nonmagical

weapon  or  missile  that  strikes  it  into

harmless  light,  destroying  it  forever.

Contact  with  the  starmantle does  not

destroy magic weapons or missiles, but

the  starmantles  wearer  is  entitled  to  a

Reflex saving throw (DC 15) each time

he  is  struck  by  such  a  weapon;  success

indicates that the wearer takes only half

damage  from  the  weapon  (rounded

down).

Material  Component: A  pinch  of  dust

from a pixies wing (20 gp).

gets within range. Each star requires its

own ranged touch attack roll.

A  nonevil  target  takes  1d8  points  of

damage,  half  of  which  is  nonlethal

(round  down).  Evil  targets  take  1d8

points  of  lethal  damage  instead.  The

stars  are  magical  force,  so  they  ignore

incorporeality.

Stars of Arvandor

You  create  one  tiny,  twinkling  star  per

level (maximum 10 stars). These minute

starbursts  orbit  your  head  like  ioun

stones.  As  a  free  action,  you  can  launch

Spell Resistance: Yes

Shards of heavenly light rain down from

above.  Evil  creatures  within  the  spells

area that fail a Fortitude save are blinded

permanently. The light shards also slice

the  flesh  of  evil  creatures,  dealing  1d6

halves  the  damage,  which  is  of  divine

Sublime Revelry

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Sublime revelry immediately removes any

lingering  effects  of  pain,  including

penalties  imposed  by  symbol  of  pain,

angry ache, and similar spells. It does not

prevent  damage  or  block  other  effects

not directly related to pain.

The  spell  also  induces  a  pleasurable

fuguelike state that yields the following

additional effects:

First, sublime revelry renders its targets

immune  to  mind-affecting  spells  and

effects for the spells duration, as well as

suppresses  (but  not  dispels)  ones  cur-

rently in effect.

Second, targets of the spell take only

half damage from all melee and ranged

attacks  for  the  duration  of  the  spell.

as a daylight spell. However, its ability to

generate  bright  light  is  not  the  spells

primary function.

The sunmantle grants the target dam-

age  reduction  5/.  Furthermore,  if  the

target  is  struck  by  a  melee  attack  that

deals hit point damage, a tendril of light

lashes out at the attacker, striking unerr-

ingly  and  dealing  5  points  of  damage.

Because  of  the  brilliance  of  the  sun-

mantle, creatures sensitive to bright light

(such as dark elves) take the usual attack

penalties when in the light radius of the

sunmantle.

Sacrifice: 1d4  points  of  Strength

Duration: 6 hours/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  instantly  relieves  the  nega-

tive  effects  of  hunger  and  thirst  and

allows the targets to go without food or

water for the duration of the spell, suf-

fering  no  ill  effects  from  the  depriva-

tion.  An  affected  creature  can  eat  or

drink  normally  without  difficulty.

When  the  spell  ends,  the  creatures

must resume normal eating and drink-

ing habits, but do not feel any adverse

effects from the missed meals. The size

of  the  creature  is  not  a  factor;  a  Tiny

lizard  and  a  Colossal  dragon  are  both

fully nourished by the spell.

Material  Component: A  flask  of  warm

wine and a loaf of bread.

Telepathy Tap

Divination

Level: Sanctified 3

Components: Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Area: 10-ft./level-radius emanation

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You can overhear the telepathic conver-

sations  of  other  creatures  within  the

spells area. Telepathy tap does not allow

you  to  detect  the  uncommunicated

thoughts  of  creatures  or  understand

conversations spoken in languages you

do not comprehend.

In  an  area  where  numerous  tele-

pathic  conversations  are  occurring  at

the  same  time,  you  must  specify  the

creatures you wish to overhear during a

given round. You can separate and deci-

pher  the  telepathic  messages  of  a

number  of  creatures  equal  to  1  +  your

Intelligence bonus.

Telepathy  tap does  not  allow  you  to

overhear the telepathic conversations of

creatures  protected  by  a  mind  blank

spell, nor does it grant the ability to tele-

pathically  communicate  with  other

creatures.

If  it  fails,  its  skin  becomes  translucent

and  faintly  radiant  and  the  creature  is

immobilized,  standing  helpless.  The

subject is aware and breathes normally,

but  cannot  take  any  physical  actions,

even  speech.  It  can,  however,  execute

purely  mental  actions  (such  as  using  a

spell-like ability). The effect is similar to

hold person.

Each  round  you  maintain  the  spell,

the creature must attempt another Forti-

tude save. If it fails the save, it takes 1d6

points of permanent Constitution drain.

Each round you maintain the spell, how-

ever,  you  take  1d6  points  of  nonlethal

damage. If you fall unconscious, or if the

creature  succeeds  at  its  Fortitude  save,

the spell ends.

Material Component: A pure crystal or

clear  gemstone  worth  at  least  50  gp.

Touch of Adamantine

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Weapon touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (object,

harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object, harm-

Sacrifice: 1d3  points  of  Strength

less)

damage.

Tomb of Light

Transmutation [Good]

Level: Cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Touch

Target: Evil extraplanar creature

touched

Duration: Concentration

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

When you cast this spell, you attempt to

draw out the impure substance of an evil

extraplanar creature and replace it with

your  own  pure  substance.  The  spell  is

draining for you to cast, but it is deadly

to  evil  outsiders  and  other  extraplanar

creatures with the taint of evil.

When you touch the target creature,

it must make a Fortitude saving throw. If

it succeeds, it is unaffected by the spell.

This spell grants one weapon the prop-

erties  of  an  adamantine  weapon.  The

weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus

on  attack  rolls  (as  though  it  was  a

masterwork  weapon)  and  bypasses

hardness when striking objects or sun-

dering weapons, ignoring hardness less

than  20.  The  affected  weapon  also  has

one-third  more  hit  points  than  normal

for the duration of the spell.

You  cant  cast  this  spell  on  a  natural

weapon,  such  as  an  unarmed  strike.  A

monks  unarmed  strike  is  considered  a

weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by

this spell.

If the weapon is made of another spe-

cial  material  (cold  iron  or  silver,  for

example), it loses the benefits of its orig-

inal special material for the spells dura-

tion.

Touch  of  adamantine cannot  be  made

permanent  with  a  permanency spell.

Level: Sanctified 1

impart the luck of the fey to one nonevil

being. The target gains a +1 luck bonus

on all saving throws for the duration of

the spell.

Abstinence: The  caster  must  refrain

from imbibing alcohol for 3 days prior to

casting this spell.

Unearthly Beauty

Transmutation [Good]

Level: Druid 8, Fey 8

As blinding beauty, but at any time during

the duration of the spell, you can evoke

an  additional  effect  as  a  free  action.

When you choose, any creature within

30 feet of you that is looking directly at

you must succeed on a Will save or die.

Abstinence  Component: You  must  ab-

stain  from  sexual  intercourse  for  one

month before casting this spell.

Valiant Steed

Conjuration (Calling) [Good]

Components: V, S, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Calls 1 pegasus or unicorn

Duration: Instantaneous; see text

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The caster calls a special servant of the

exalted  god Valarianeither  a  pegasus

or  unicornto  her  location. The  crea-

ture  serves  the  caster  for  up  to  a  year,

during  which  time  the  caster  may  dis-

miss  it  at  any  time.  It  is  intelligent,  so

the  caster  can  assign  it  complex  tasks.

Although useful as a mount, it will not

undertake a quest or otherwise take on

complex  burdens  beyond  the  supervi-

sion of the caster.

If  the  caster  attempts  to  conjure

another  creature  using  this  spell,  the

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None; see text

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  encapsulates  a  weapon  in  a

faint  blue  glow.  In  addition  to  dealing

normal  damage,  the  weapon  dispels  on

contact any summoned creature or quasi-

real  creature  brought  into  being  by  a

Conjuration  (summoning)  or  Illusion

(shadow) spell. This requires a successful

dispel  check  (1d20  +  casters  level)

against  DC  11  +  the  level  of  the  caster

who summoned or created the creature.

If  the  vanishing  weapon is  a  ranged

weapon, the spells effect is imparted to

the weapons ammunition.

A  summoned  or  quasi-real  creature

goaded  into  touching  the  vanishing

weapon is also dispelled.

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your  words  allow  the  target  creature  the

merest  glimpse  of  the  blessed  joy  of  the

moment of regret for its evil deeds. For 1

round, the target is dazed. In addition, the

creature  is  more  susceptible  to  future

redemption.  For  the  next  24  hours,  the

A luminous ring of holy power appears

above  the  head  of  a  good  creature  and

remains in place until the spell expires

Target: One evil creature/level

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

The  affected  creatures  own  evil

thoughts and impulses blossom in their

minds  into  intense  suspicion  and  dis-

any  moment,  and  attacks  the  nearest

evil  creature  using  whatever  attack

form  (melee  or  ranged  attack,  spell,

supernatural  or  spell-like  ability)  is

most  effective  against  that  foe,  to  the

best  of  its  knowledge.  Affected  crea-

tures  do  not  completely  ignore  other

threats, but attack evil creatures in pref-

erence to any other foes.

Warcry

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-

Affecting]

Level: Bard 3, champion of Gwynhar-

wyf 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 30 ft.

Effect: Cone-shaped burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  unleash  a  tremendous  battle  cry

that  causes  creatures  within  a  30-foot

cone  to  cower  in  fear  for  1d4  rounds.

Warding Gems

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Cleric 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: 1 gem/3 caster levels

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  cast  this  spell  upon  one  or  more

gems,  imbuing  them  with  healing

energy. The gems leap from your hand,

fly to the target, and begin orbiting the

targets head like ioun stones.

Each warding gem is a receptacle that

holds  10  hp.  The  target  can,  as  a  free

action, access the healing energy inside

a warding gem; the energy is released as a

purple-white  arc  of  divine  power  that

unerringly strikes the target, healing 10

points  of  damage.  The  target  cannot

choose  to  absorb  only  a  portion  of  a

warding gems healing power. A warding

gem depleted  of  its  healing  energy

instantly turns to dust. At the end of the

spells  duration,  any  unspent  warding

gems lose their healing power and fall to

the  ground;  these  can  be  reused  for  a

later spell.

A  single  creature  can  have  no  more

than  five  warding  gems encircling  it  at

one  time.  A  warding  gem has  AC  24,

hardness 10, and 10 hp; if its destroyed,

any  healing  power  contained  within  is

lost.

MAGIC ITEMS

The forces of good are constantly struggling to match the battle

readiness  of  the  forces  of  darkness.  When  faced  with  well-

armed minions of evil, exalted characters need special items to

help  them  to  victory.  Several  such  magic  items  are  described

below.

ARMOR AND SHIELD SPECIAL ABILITIES

These armor special abilities are available in addition to the spe-

cial  abilities  given  in  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide and  other

sources.

Angelic: This armor or shield is adorned with featherlike pat-

terns and other heavenly motifs. The armor or shield increases

the  wearers  enhancement  bonus  to  AC  by  +1  against  attacks

from evil creatures. It also grants its user a +4 sacred bonus on

saving  throws  against  spells  with  the  evil  descriptor.  An  evil

creature that dons the armor or uses the shield does not gain its

benefits.

Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

dispel evil, Phierans resolve, creator must be good; Price +2 bonus.

Empyreal: This exquisitely crafted armor or shield, favored

by celestial champions of good, is often set with precious gems

and  adorned  with  images  of  powerful  archons,  eladrins,  or

guardinals. The  wearer  can  transfer  all  or  part  of  its  enhance-

ment  bonus  to  a  sacred  bonus  on  saving  throws. The  wearer

decides to make the transfer on his turn, and the choice remains

in effect until his next turn. Any evil creature wearing empyreal

armor or holding an empyreal shield is sickened (2 penalty on

attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) for as

long as the armor is worn or the shield is held (no saving throw).

Moderate abjuration and necromancy [good]; CL 9th; Craft

Magic Arms and Armor, resistance, shield of faith, sicken evil; Price

+2 bonus.

Exalted: The wearer of this pristine armor, if good, takes only

half  of  the  extra  damage  dealt  by  an  unholy  weapon  (+1d6

instead of +2d6) and gains the benefits of a constant protection

from evil spell. Furthermore, the armor negates the vile damage

dealt by a vile melee, ranged, or natural weapon (described in

the Book of Vile Darkness).

Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

protection from evil, creator must be good; Price +3 bonus.

Sacred: A suit of armor or a shield with this quality assists

only  wearers  who  have  the  ability  to  turn  or  rebuke  undead.

Sacred armor or a sacred shield increases the owners effective

level for the turning check by +2. Armor and shields with this

ability are always specific to a deity and predominantly feature

the gods holy symbol.

Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

ability to turn or rebuke undead; Price +2 bonus.

Soulfire: This armors wearer is immune to all death spells,

magical  death  effects,  and  energy  drain,  and  any  negative

energy effects (such as from chill touch or inflict spells).

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

death ward; Price +4 bonus.

Twilight: This suit of armor, favored by eladrin spellcasters,

becomes semi-incorporeal and translucent when donned. It also

possesses  a  faint  sunset-colored  sheen.  The  twilight  armor

reduces the chance of arcane spell failure by 10%.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price

+1 bonus.

SPECIFIC ARMORS AND SHIELDS

The following specific suits of armor and shields usually are pre-

constructed with exactly the qualities described here.

Asura  Shield: Elite  asura  soldiers  are  known  to  bear  this

shield in times of war. Wreathed in holy flames, this +2 bashing

heavy  spiked  steel  shield deals  regular  bashing  damage  (2d6+2

points  for  a  Medium  spiked  shield)  plus  1d6  points  of  fire

damage, plus 1d6 points of damage of divine origin that affects

only evil creatures.

Simply touching the blazing shield deals 1d6 points of fire

damage, plus 1d6 of additional damage (of divine origin) that

affects only evil creatures.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL  9th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, bulls strength, flamestrike; Price 27,180 gp; Cost to Create:

13,680 gp + 1,080 XP.

Devilhusk: This suit of +5 hide armor is fashioned from the

skinned hide of a barbed devil. Barbs covering the armor allow

the  wearer  to  deal  3d8  points  of  damage  plus  1-1/2  times  its

Strength  modifier  to  a  grabbed  opponent  with  a  successful

grapple check.

Vassal Armor: Worn by emissaries and proxies of powerful

planar rulers and deities, this suit of +3 exalted half-plate is rein-

forced with Ysgardian heartwire (see Special Materials in Chap-

ter 3: Exalted Equipment), which increases the wearers AC by

+2 solely for purposes of the roll to confirm a critical hit.

WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITIES

These weapon special abilities are available in addition to the

special abilities in the Dungeon Masters Guide and other sources.

Banishing: Any  extraplanar  creature  with  25  Hit  Dice  or

fewer that is struck by the weapon must succeed on a DC 24

Will save or be banished back to its home plane. Spell resistance

applies, and a creature so banished cannot return for at least 24

hours. The wielder may choose to deactivate this special ability

as a free action. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted confer

the banishing power upon their ammunition.

Strong  abjuration;  CL  13th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

banishment; Price +3 bonus.

Blessed: This replicates the effect of the bless weapon spell, but

it is permanent and always in effect. The weapon becomes good,

which  means  it  can  bypass  the  damage  reduction  of  certain

creatures, particularly evil outsiders. Furthermore, all critical hit

rolls  against  evil  foes  are  automatically  successful,  so  every

threat  is  a  critical  hit.  This  last  effect  does  not  apply  to  any

weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits,

such as a keen weapon or vorpal weapon.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

bless weapon; Price +1 bonus.

Enfeebling: On a critical hit, this weapon deals 1d6+2 points

of temporary Strength damage in addition to its regular damage.

Spell resistance applies. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted

confer the enfeebling power upon their ammunition.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ray

of enfeeblement; Price +1 bonus.

Heavenly Burst: On a successful critical hit against an evil

creature, this weapon discharges a radiant burst that deals +3d6

points of damage to the target and blinds it for 1 round. A suc-

cessful DC 14 Fortitude save negates the blindness. Bows, cross-

bows,  and  slings  so  crafted  confer  the  heavenly  burst  power

upon their ammunition.

Every  time  this  weapon  discharges  a  radiant  burst,  the

wielder takes 1d2 points of temporary Strength damage.

Faint  evocation;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

Ayaillas  radiant  burst,  creator  must  be  good;  Price  +2  bonus.

Paralyzing: Any  creature  struck  by  this  weapon  must  suc-

ceed on a DC 17 Will save or be paralyzed. Each round on its

turn,  the  target  may  attempt  a  new  saving  throw  to  end  the

effect; otherwise, the paralysis lasts 10 rounds. Spell resistance

applies. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted confer the para-

lyzing power upon their ammunition.

Moderate  enchantment;  CL  10th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, hold monster; Price +2 bonus.

Righteous: This weapon acts as though it has the spell detect

evil upon  it.  This  enchantment  is  always  active  unless  the

wielder commands the weapon to deactivate (a free action). The

wielder receives a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against

any creature with a strong or overwhelming aura of evil (see the

detect evil spell description in the Players Handbook). Bows, cross-

bows,  and  slings  so  crafted  confer  the  righteous  power  upon

their ammunition.

Price +4 bonus.

Roaring: This  weapon  unleashes  a  tremendous  roar  with

each  swing.  Any  evil  creature  struck  by  the  roaring  weapon

must  succeed  on  a  DC  22  Will  save  or  be  shaken.  A  roaring

weapon also deals +2d6 points of sonic damage on a successful

critical hit. A roaring weapon cannot also have the thundering

ability (see the Dungeon Masters Guide), and vice versa.

Strong  evocation;  CL  15th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

leonals roar, creator must be good; Price +3 bonus.

SPECIFIC WEAPONS

Exalted heroes and defenders of the Upper Planes alike need

great weapons to triumph over great evil. The following specific

weapons usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities

described here.

Bow of the Solars: This Large +2 composite longbow (+4 Str

bonus) turns any arrow it fires into a slaying arrow targeting any

creature type the wielder chooses.

Strong  necromancy;  CL  13th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

finger of death; Price 100,100 gp; Cost to Create 50,500 gp + 3,968 XP.

Celestial  Blade: This  Large  +3  bastard  sword is  the  favored

weapon of planetars. It always shines light equivalent to a torch

(20-foot radius, with shadowy illumination out to a range of 40

feet), and its blade is typically engraved with the symbol of the

deity served by the planetar.

Price 18,335 gp; Cost to Create 9,335 gp + 720 XP.

Celestial Mace: This +3 disruption heavy mace is the favored

weapon  of  astral  devas.  It  always  shines  light  equivalent  to  a

torch (20-foot radius, with shadowy illumination out to a range

of 40 feet).

Strong  transmutation;  CL  14th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, disrupting weapon; Price 50,312 gp; Cost to Create 25,312

gp + 2,000 XP.

Dart of the Phoenix: This red and gold +1 returning dart has

a tail made of phoenix feathers. Throwing the dart requires a sac-

rifice  of  1d4  points  of  temporary  Strength  damage.  However,

any creature struck by the dart, regardless of whether it takes

damage, must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly

slain and reduced to a small pile of ashes. If the save succeeds,

the creature takes 13d6 points of fire damage instead. If a crea-

ture  makes  its  saving  throw  but  is  slain  by  the  damage,  it  is

reduced to a pile of ashes as well.

Any creature reduced to ashes by the dart reforms after 2d6

rounds, appearing in the exact spot where it died and in what-

ever  state  it  was  before  being  incinerated.  Although  damage

from  the  actual  dart  remains,  all  fire  damage  is  instantly

Creatures  immune  to  fire  take  no  fire  damage  and  are  not

makes its Fortitude save.

and Armor, phoenix fire; Price 99,400 gp plus 5 sp; Cost to Create

49,900 gp plus 5 sp + 3,960 XP.

Demondoom: Favored by dwarven foes of the tanarri, this

+2 holy demon bane warhammer is fashioned from cold iron with

a head shaped like two clenched fists. Once per day, the wielder

can make a blinding strike against a demon. The wielder must

declare he is using the blinding strike before making the attack

roll;  if  the  attack  hits  and  the  hammer  bypasses  the  demons

spell  resistance  with  a  successful  level  check  (1d20+15),  the

demon is blinded as if by a power word blind spell. If the attack

misses or the blinding strike is used on a creature other than a

demon, the blinding strike is wasted.

Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

holy smite, power word blind, creator must be good; Price 51,512

gp; Cost to Create 25,912 gp + 2,048 XP.

Hellpiercer: Tested in battle against the fiendish legions of

Hell, this colorful +3 shocking burst arrow or +3 shocking burst bolt

is treated as a silvered weapon for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction. Furthermore, the head of the arrow or bolt

contains a tiny reservoir of purified couatl venom (see Ravages

and Afflictions in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment). This ravage

harms only evil creatures, including outsiders that are normally

immune to poison (such as devils).

Moderate evocation and transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic

Arms  and  Armor,  silvered  weapon; Price  4,007  gp  per  arrow  or

bolt; Cost to Create 2,007 gp + 40 XP per arrow or bolt.

Nightblade  of  Arvandor: This  +2  longsword appears  to  be

made of black steel. Within the blade, one can see miniscule

twinkling stars. Upon command, the sword launches starlike

pulses of light. Each round, as a standard action, the nightblade

can fire as many stars from its blade as the wielder has ranged

attacks.  Using  the  sword  in  this  fashion  provokes  attacks  of

opportunity, and each star requires its own ranged touch attack

roll.  A  nonevil  creature  struck  by  a  star  takes  1d8  points  of

damage,  half  of  which  is  nonlethal  damage  (rounded  down).

An  evil  creature  struck  by  a  star  takes  1d8  points  of  lethal

damage.  The  stars  are  magical  force,  not  weapons,  so  they

ignore damage reduction and incorporeality.

Moderate  evocation  [good];  CL  6th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, stars of Arvandor, creator must be good; Price 44,315 gp;

Cost to Create 22,315 gp + 1,760 XP.

RINGS

Easy to conceal, rings are often crafted by good creatures to aid

against the forces of darkness.

Ring of Adamantine Touch: When worn, this adamantine

ring allows the wearer to make melee weapon attacks and natu-

ral attacks as though wielding an adamantine weapon.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Forge Ring, touch of adaman-

tine; Price 120,000 gp; Cost to Create 60,000 gp + 4,800 XP.

Ring of Affliction: This mithral ring is shaped like a beauti-

ful feathered serpent. Any natural or unarmed attack made by

the rings wearer forces the target to succeed on a DC 17 Forti-

tude save or succumb to an affliction of the ring wearers choice

(see the affliction spell description for more information).

Strong  necromancy  [good];  CL  12th;  Forge  Ring,  affliction,

+ 2,880 gp.

Ring of Solar Wings: This brilliant gold ring causes is inlaid

with celestial script. When the ring is put on, the wearer grows

gleaming white wings (like those of a solar) and gains the abil-

ity fly at a speed of 150 feet (good maneuverability). The wings

disappear if the ring is removed. If the ring is removed while the

wearer is in flight, the wearer floats to the ground as per a feather

fall spell. If the wearer already has a functional set of wings, the

ring does not create new ones, but the wearer may use the rings

fly speed if its faster.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Forge Ring, feather fall, poly-

morph; Price 118,000 gp; Cost to Create 59,000 gp + 4,720 XP.

Ring of Vengeance: This gold ring glows softly when worn

by a good-aligned creature. If the wearer of the ring dies, an arc

of divine energy leaps from the ring and deals 15d6 points of

damage to the creature that dealt the killing blow. The damage is

of divine origin and of a nonspecific energy type. The target of

the attack can make a DC 19 Reflex save to reduce the damage

by  half.  Once  the  ring  unleashes  its  energy,  it  turns  to  dust.

Strong abjuration [good]; CL 15th; Forge Ring, vengeance halo,

180 XP.

STAFFS

The following staffs are available to good characters, in addition

to the ones in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Staff of Rapture: This ash staff bears a few holy etchings but

otherwise  looks  unremarkable.  However,  in  the  hands  of  a

cleric, the staff sheds golden light as brightly as a torch.

The staff of rapture can be used as a +1 quarterstaff, but it deals

only nonlethal damage. Against evil creatures, it has a critical

threat range of 1720.

WONDROUS MAGIC ITEMS

The following items are among many found in the arsenals of

good-aligned creatures committed to the capture or destruction

of all things evil.

Antimagic  Shackles: These  adamantine  manacles  fit  any

Small to Large creature and create an antimagic field to a radius of

5 feet when they are fastened. The DC to slip out of the shackles

is 28, but breaking them is nearly impossible, requiring a DC 40

Strength check.

Moderate  abjuration;  CL  11th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  anti-

magic field; Price 132,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.

Incense  of  Consecration: When  burned  in  a  censer  or

thurible, the smoke from this incense creates a consecrate effect

in a 20-foot emanation. For the duration of the effect, the censer

or thurible can be moved, moving the area of the consecrate as

well. The incense burns for 6 hours, after which it loses all mag-

ical properties.

Faint  evocation;  CL  3rd;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  consecrate;

Price 300 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Retributive Amulet:This amulet provides a +2 sacred bonus to

AC.  In  addition,  when  the  wearer  takes  damage  from  a  melee

attack made with a natural or hand-held weapon, the damage is

divided equally between the attacker and the target. If the damage

is an odd number, the extra point of damage goes to the attacker.

The retributive amulet deals the same types of wounds upon

the  attacker  that  the  wearer  receives,  but  only  damage  to  hit

points. For example, a rogue who uses a poisoned dagger to stab

the amulets wearer would receive an identical gash in the same

spot  as  the  wearer,  but  would  not  suffer  ability  loss  from  the

weapons poison.

The amulet must be worn to function; it needs no command

word for activation.

Faint  abjuration;  CL  5th;  Craft Wondrous  Item,  shield  other;

Price 56,000 gp.

Shackles  of  Silence: These  wrought-iron  manacles  fit  any

Small to Large creature. They exude a silence effect in a radius

just large enough to contain the creature they holda 2 1/2-

foot radius for a Small or Medium creature, a 5-foot radius for a

Large creature. However, if the creature bound by them escapes

without  opening  themby  slipping  out  of  the  shackles  or

breaking themthe silence effect ends and the shackles ring for

1 round, as the effect of an alarm spells audible alarm. The DC to

break or slip out of the shackles is 28.

Faint abjuration and illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item,

alarm, silence; Price 12,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.

Starmantle  Cloak: This  draping  black  cloak  turns  into  a

sparkling mantle of tiny, cascading stars when worn. The cloak

sheds  light  as  a  torch,  renders  the  wearer  impervious  to  non-

magical  weapon  attacks,  and  transforms  any  nonmagical

weapon or missile that strikes the wearer into harmless light,

destroying  it.  Contact  with  the  starmantle does  not  destroy

magic weapons or missiles, but the starmantles wearer is entitled

to a DC 15 Reflex save each time he is struck by such a weapon;

success indicates that the wearer takes only half damage from

the attack.

Moderate  abjuration;  CL  11th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  star-

mantle; Price 132,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Thurible of Consecration: Each of these golden censers is

sacred to a particular deity whose symbol appears on it. When a

cleric of that deity burns incense of consecration in the thurible

and carries it, the effects of the incense are increased as though

an altar or similar fixture were in the area of the consecrate spell,

doubling its effects. If a cleric of a different deity uses the thuri-

ble, it has no special effect.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, consecrate, cre-

ator must be a cleric of the deity to whom the thurible is sacred;

Price 5,000 gp; Weight 4 lb.

Trumpet  of  Doom: This  small  brass  trumpet  is  engraved

with interwoven patterns of feathers and flames. The trumpet

emits  a  haunting  blare  that  fills  evil  enemies  with  a  terrible

sense of dread. All evil creatures within 100 feet that can hear

the trumpets blare are shaken for 1 minute (DC 14 Will save

negates). The trumpet can be blown up to three times per day.

Moderate necromancy; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, doom;

Price 7,185 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Trumpet  of  Healing: This  finely  wrought  trumpet  plays

beautifully  in  the  hands  of  any  talented  trumpeter.  Invoking

any  of  its  magic,  however,  requires  playing  the  horn  uninter-

rupted  for  a  full  round  and  making  a  DC  15  Perform  (wind

instruments)  check. The  trumpeteer  can  employ  the  trumpet

three  times  per  day,  selecting  from  the  following  powers  for

each  use:  remove  blindness/deafness,  remove  disease,  cure  serious

wounds,  or  neutralize  poison.  These  powers  affect  all  creatures

within 360 feet of the horn. In addition, the trumpet can heal a

single creature within hearing range of the uplifting song once

per day. Evil creatures cannot benefit from these effects; in fact,

they  hear  nothing  at  all  when  the  horn  plays. The  trumpeter

cannot personally benefit from the trumpets healing powers.

Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, cure seri-

ous wounds, heal, neutralize poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove

disease, creator  must  be  good;  Price  115,440  gp;  Weight  2  lb.

Vambraces  of  Evils  Warding:  These  golden  bracers  are

engraved with holy runes and fit snugly over the arms of any

creature that dons them. Ranged attacks made by evil creatures

against the wearer take a 4 penalty.

An evil creature that dons the vambraces of evils warding takes

2d6 points of damage per round.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, protection from

arrows, creator must be good; Price 18,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

INTELLIGENT ITEMS

The intelligent items presented below can fit easily into most

campaigns and are appropriate treasures for exalted heroes to

find and use. Feel free to change an items name, history, align-

ment,  personality,  or  abilities  to  suit  the  needs  of  your  cam-

paign.

advisor of many kings, Barsolidor succeeded in imprinting frag-

ments of his life experience on the blade before his death. The

sword vehemently opposes tyranny and slavery, and when its

current wielder grows too old to fight, it asks to be passed on to

a younger champion of good who shares its purpose and ideals.

Strong  divination;  CL  15th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

cure  moderate  wounds,  detect  evil,  detect  law,  zone  of  truth; Price

Speech, 120 ft. vision and hearing; Ego score 6.

Languages: Celestial, Common, Infernal.

Lesser Powers: Ease pain 1/day, vision of heaven 3/day.

Personality: Legend has it that a faithful cleric of Pelor found

this white ash staff with silver inlaid runes in a brook while on

a pilgrimage. The cleric heard a babbling sound coming from

the brook, walked out among its shoals, and drew the talking

staff from its shallow depths. Caduceus (kah-DOO-shuss) has no

memory of its origin, but it chats incessantly about the many

great heroes it has helped over the years. The staff abhors blood-

shed and violence, and it sometimes elects to not heal wounds it

feels are justified or deserved.

Moderate  conjuration;  CL  15th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, cure serious wounds, ease pain, lesser restoration, remove blind-

ness/deafness,  remove  disease,  vision  of  heaven; Price  34,950  gp.

Ezrylon: +2 demon bane short sword with a +4 ring of protection*

built into its pommel; AL LG; Int 13, Wis 10, Cha 13; Empathy,

60 ft. vision and hearing; Ego score 11.

This ring does not function if Ezrylon is wielded in a hand

with a magic ring worn on it. This ring confers its deflection

bonus to AC only while the weapon is drawn.

Special: This weapon is fashioned from Solanian truesteel (see

Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment) and gains a +1 bonus on the con-

firmation roll for a critical hit.

Languages (understand only): Abyssal, Common.

Lesser Powers: Daze monster 3/day, 10 ranks in Knowledge (the

planes) (total modifier +11).

Personality: A half-celestial weaponsmith crafted Ezrylon for a

halfling paladin of unshakable valor. During a raid on an evil

temple, the halfling fell beneath the maul of a fiendish mino-

taur cleric, who later tasked a minion to destroy the paladins

sword. Ezrylon persuaded the slow-witted underling to sell it

instead, and gradually the blade found its way into the hands of

an evil gnome assassin. Through this unlikely partnership, Ezry-

lon learned that evil often feeds on itself, and for several years,

the assassin put Ezrylons demon bane power to good use. The

assassin lost the blade in a gambling match with a shady mer-

chant, who is currently seeking a buyer for the blade. Ezrylon

isnt quick to judge evildoers, but it swells with anger when it

senses demons nearby.

Moderate abjuration; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Forge Ring, daze monster, shield of faith, summon monster I; Price

64,810 gp.

Hwyrr,  the  Clarion  Harp: Harp  of  charming; AL  CG;  Int  18,

Wis 10, Cha 18; Speech, telepathy, 120 ft. darkvision, blindsense,

and hearing; Ego score 14.

Languages: Celestial,  Common,  Draconic,  Elven,  Gnome.

Lesser  Powers: elation 3/day,  Faerinaals  hymn (see  below),  10

ranks in Knowledge (history) (total modifier +14).

Greater Powers: Dismissal 1/day, fear 3/day (against foes only).

Personality: The frame of this golden harp is fashioned into

a  handsome  likeness  of  Faerinaal,  Queen  Morwels  eladrin

consort (see Chapter 7: Celestial Paragons). Crafted by a firre

eladrin bard in Queen Morwels court, Hwyrr serves Faerinaal

as a chronicler of events on the Material Plane. As it finds its

way  into  the  hands  of  different  adventuring  bards,  Hwyrr

learns  new  tales  of  heroism  that  it  will  someday  recount  to

Faerinaal  when  it  finally  returns  to  Queen  Morwels  court.

When it senses battle occurring within 60 feet, Hwyrr auto-

matically begins playing Faerinaals hymn and continues to do

so  until  one  of  its  other  powers  is  employed.  Hwyrr  takes

great pride in its appearance and constantly insinuates itself

into  conversations,  recounting  tales  of  its  past  owners

exploits to help its current owner deal with immediate or sim-

ilar problems.

Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

dismissal, elation, Faerinaals hymn, fear, suggestion; Price 84,000 gp.

Both ends of the quarterstaff have the ki focus special ability.

Languages: Aquan, Celestial, Common.

Lesser  Powers: Water  walk  3/day  (wielder  only),  10  ranks  of

Sense Motive (total modifier +12).

Personality: Iasalas is imbued with the spirit of an elder water

elemental  and  is  adorned  with  graven  symbols  of  the  sea,

including eels and anemones. A fierce weapon, it relishes the

sound of evils brittle bones cracking under its mighty blows. It

has  little  patience  for  those  of  different  alignment  and  those

who cant wield it masterfully, and it chides a wielder who fre-

quently  misses  his  enemies  in  combat  and  criticizes  under-

handed  or  unseemly  tactics.  Once  earned,  however,  Iasalass

loyalty is unflinching and absolute.

Strong  transmutation;  CL  12th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  water  walk,  creator  must  be  a  monk;  Price  48,100  gp.

Lunistra, the Heartstar: +4 soulfire breastplate; AL NG; Int 12,

Wis 10, Cha 12; Empathy, 30 ft. vision and hearing; Ego score 11.

Languages (understand only): Celestial, Common.

Lesser  Powers: Cure  moderate  wounds 3/day  (on  wearer  only).

Personality: Lunistra is a golden breastplate shaped in the like-

ness of a lupinal guardinals visage, with a golden eight-pointed

star adorning its forehead. When donned by a creature of good

alignment, Lunistra exudes unflinching confidence in its ability

to  protect  the  wearer  from  grave  harm.  Lunistra  maintains  a

constant  readied  action  to  cast  cure  moderate  wounds on  the

wearer if he or she is reduced to 0 hp or fewer, and it resists any

attempt by the wearer to deplete its cure moderate wounds ability

in less critical situations.

Strong  abjuration;  CL  13th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

cure moderate wounds, death ward; Price 71,850 gp.

Special: Seryl is made from serren, a wood found on the first

layer  of  Arborea  (see  Special  Materials  in  Chapter  3:  Exalted

Equipment).  The  wood  grants  Seryl  the  ghost  touch  special

quality, although this is a nonmagical feature.

Languages: Elven.

Lesser  Powers: Faerie  fire 3/day,  10  ranks  in  Diplomacy  (total

modifier +12), 10 ranks in Spot (total modifier +12).

Personality: Although  it  is  over  five  hundred  years  old,  the

elven bow named Seryl views the world with a childs sense of

wonder. For reasons that elude it, Seryl finds dwarves especially

hilarious and enjoys spending time around them, laughing at

their jokes and marveling at their tales. It does not enjoy inflict-

ing pain on others and strongly advocates taking prisoners over

needless slaughter.

Moderate conjuration; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

cure light wounds, faerie fire; Price 38,900 gp.

Torvion,  the  Fifth  Shield: +4  angelic  light  steel  shield; AL  LG;

Int 10, Wis 13, Cha 13; Empathy, 60 ft. vision and hearing; Ego

score 10.

Special: Torvion is fashioned from aurorum (see Special Mate-

rials in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment for details). If sundered, it

can be fully restored by rejoining its broken fragments (as a full-

round action).

Languages (understand only): Celestial.

Lesser  Powers: Bless 3/day,  eyes  of  the  avoral (continuous)  on

good-aligned owner.

Personality: Torvion is one of seven identical shields crafted

on Celestia. It was given to an astral deva named Jeveth, who

was summoned via greater planar ally spell to the Material Plane

to help adventurers destroy a fiendish red dragon. Jeveth bore

Torvion into glorious battle and perished moments before the

wyrm  met  its  end.  The  adventurers  placed  Torvion  and  the

devas other possessions in a hallowed tomb within their keep.

Although the keep stands in ruins today, these items still lie

beneath  an  alabaster  statue  of  Jeveth  that  remains  largely

intact.  If  found,  Torvion  conveys  excitement  at  being

unearthed, exuding tremendous confidence when brought to

bear in battle. However, it manifests an unsettling fear of red

dragons,  solitude,  and  dark  places  when  exposed  to  them.  It

need not be drawn to confer its eyes of the avoral ability on its

owner.

Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

bless, dispel evil, eyes of the avoral, Phierans resolve, caster must be

good; Price 49,659 gp.

Lesser  Powers: Ease  pain  3/day, refreshment 3/day,  10  ranks  of

Intimidate (total modifier +13).

Greater Powers: Detect chaotic evil at will.

Personality: Fashioned  by  a  planetar  weaponsmith  named

Jebylon,  Zaethwar  exists  to  slay  chaotic  evil  creatures  and

demons in particular. It refuses to settle for half-measures in

the war against chaos and evil and mentally asserts itself over

any  wielder  who  tries  to  withdraw  from  a  battle  in  which

chaotic  evil  opponents  are  present,  endeavoring  to  stay  and

fight.  If  its  wielder  is  subjected  to  a  pain  effect  or  nonlethal

damage, Zaethwar casts ease pain or refreshment to counter any

such debilitation.

Strong  evocation  [good];  CL  18th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  ease  pain,  holy  smite,  refreshment, creator  must  be  good;

Price 134,025 gp.

MAJOR ARTIFACTS

The following artifacts are ancient beyond reckoning, surfacing

periodically  to  help  the  servants  of  good  overcome  the  fell

legions of evil.

Cup and Talisman of AlAkbar: This pair of holy artifacts

first appeared in the desert city of Khaibar shortly after a great

devastation. Sultan Amhara of Khaibar sent agents to retrieve

the cup and talisman after they were stolen from a local temple

by bandits. Fearing a great invasion, the sultan concealed the

artifacts  in  two  different  areas  of  his  palace,  but  they  were

found  and  stolen  yet  again.  Their  current  whereabouts  are

unknown.

The Cup of AlAkbar: This chalice is made of hammered gold,

chased  with  silver  filigree  and  set  with  twelve  great  gems

(apparent value 75,000 gp). It does not radiate magic, although it

glows with a warm golden light. Seven times per day, the cup

can  turn  ordinary  water  into  a  potion  of  cure  light  wounds

(1d8+1). The potion must be imbibed directly from the cup; it

reverts  to  ordinary  water  if  poured  into  another  vessel.  The

holder of the cup can also use a bless spell once per day (cast at

20th level).

A  nongood  keeper  of  the  cup  takes  1  point  of  permanent

Constitution drain each day the cup remains in his custody. This

drain cannot be restored by any means except a wish or miracle

spell. If the keepers Constitution drops to 0, he dies and turns

into  a  deathless  guardian  (see  the  deathless  creature  type  in

Chapter 8: Monsters) bound to the cup. This ability score drain

is cumulative with the drain from the Talisman of AlAkbar (see

below).

The Talisman of AlAkbar: The talisman is made of hammered

platinum in the shape of an eight-pointed star, chased with gold

inlays,  and  with  a  small  gem  tipping  each  point.  The  star

depends from a chain of gold set with silver beading (apparent

value  25,000  gp).  Like  the  cup,  the  talisman  does  not  radiate

magic.  However,  the  wearer  can  use  the  following  spells:  At

willremove disease; 1/dayremove curse.

A nongood keeper of the talisman takes 1 point of perma-

nent Constitution drain each day the cup remains in his cus-

tody. This drain cannot be restored by any means except a wish

or miracle spell. If the keepers Constitution drops to 0, he dies

and turns into a deathless guardian (see the deathless creature

type  in  Chapter  8:  Monsters)  bound  to  the  cup. This  ability

score  drain  is  cumulative  with  the  drain  from  the  Cup  of

AlAkbar (see above).

Resonating  Effect  (Cup  and Talisman): A  creature  wearing  the

talisman and holding the cup can cast resurrection three times

per week. Casting the spell requires a 10-minute ritual during

which  a  vial  of  holy  water  must  be  poured  into  the  cup  and

poured over the remains of the creature to be resurrected. The

spell  works  only  on  nonevil  creatures  and  ignores  the  usual

material component cost.

Whenever the cup and talisman are shown at the same time,

all intelligent creatures viewing the artifacts must succeed on a

DC 19 Will save or be overcome with greed and covetousness.

Affected creatures attack the possessor in an attempt to steal the

artifacts.  Creatures  friendly  toward  the  possessor  gain  a  +4

bonus on their Will save. The effect ends when both artifacts are

removed from the affected creatures sight.

Regalia of Good

The  Regalia  of  Good:  The  three  mighty

artifacts  that  comprise  the  Regalia  of

Good were forged at the same time as

the Regalia of Evil and for the same

purpose:  for  the  use  of  a  divine

champion  to  oppose  the  similarly

equipped champions of the evil

and  neutral  deities.  For  long

centuries,  the  deities  of  good

held  the  items  of  the  regalia

together  in  one  gods  care,  but

they were stolen, separated, and

are now lost.

The Crown of Good: This thin coronet of

petrification, cold, acid, fire, and poison. The character gains

low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Finally,

if the wielder casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and

greater versions) to call a celestial, the creature serves for half

the price it would normally charge, in goods or services (at the

DMs discretion).

Resonating Effect (Three Items): While a single crea-

ture possesses all three items of the Regalia of Good,

he gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dex-

terity, and Constitution. Any weapon wielded by the

creature  becomes  a  holy  weapon,  dealing  an  extra

+2d6 points of damage to evil creatures. In addition, the

wielder  radiates  an  aura  of  courage,  granting  all  his

allies within 30 feet a +4 morale bonus on their saving

throws to resist fear effects.

Nongood Characters: A nongood character attempting to

use  any  of  these  items  immediately  takes  5d6  points  of

damage. Further, an evil-aligned character attempting to use

the items must make a Will saving throw (DC 18) or lose

2,000 XP.

twisted  mithral  is  elegant  and  slender,  fashioned  to  look  like

rays of light surrounding the head of the wearer. When a good

creature puts on the crown, its head is indeed surrounded in a

brilliant halo of light. The wearer gains immunity to electricity,

a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, a +4 deflection bonus to

Armor  Class,  and  spell  resistance  20.  He  can  use  the  spell

guidance at will. He can use the following spells three times

per day each: heroes feast, sending, and greater status. Once per

day, he can surround himself with a globe of invulnerability. All

spells are cast at 20th level. The wearer cannot speak any

lies while wearing the crown.

The Scepter of Good: This slender rod is made of mithral,

wreathed in a pattern of intertwining leaves. One end

constantly glows with a soft white light equivalent to a

torch, but heatless. While in a good characters posses-

sion, it confers a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma

and  grants  immunity  to  mind-affecting  spells  and

effects. The wielder can command obedience as if it

were a rod of rulership with no use limit, and can use

holy  smite  (DC  19)  and  searing  light  (DC  18)  three

times per day each. All spells are cast at 20th level.

The  wielder  of  the  scepter  becomes  increasingly

unable to refuse pleas for help, no matter how des-

perate the cause.

The  Orb  of  Good: This  6-inch  sphere  is  made  of

purest  crystal,  encased  in  a  filigree  cage  of  polished  mithral

laurel leaves. A good wielder can turn or destroy undead as a

15th-level  cleric.  While  in  a  good  characters  possession,  it

confers a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. Further, the

orb can be used to scry like a crystal ball with the added ability

to detect thoughts. Once per day, the orb can be used to cast heal

(as a 20th-level cleric) by touch.

Resonating  Effect  (Two  Items): While  a  single  character  pos-

sesses two items of the Regalia of Good, he gains the benefits of

the  Spell  Focus  (Good),  Gift  of  Faith,  Nimbus  of  Light,  and

Words  of  Creation  feats.  As  the  characters  nature  alters  to

reflect the celestial energies that surround the regalia, he gains

a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against electricity,

REDEEMING EVIL

MAGIC ITEMS

Some  magic  items  are  forged  in  evil  and  carry  its  taint

regardless  of  who  wears  them  or  to  what

purpose  they  are  put.  Demon  armor,

unholy weapons, a nine lives stealer,

a rod of the viper, a darkskullthese

items are evil, they work only for

evil  characters,  and  often  they

actively bring harm to good char-

acters  who  try  to  use  them.  As

such,  they  present  a  special  chal-

lenge  to  a  good  character:  she  cant

use  them,  and  selling  them  would

mean  putting  them  into  the  hands  of  a

potential enemy. What, then, is Alhandra to do with her foes

demon armor?

Though  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  accomplish,  a  character

who is devoted to good can sometimes redeem an evil magic

item, turning its power to holiness. Like creating a magic item

from scratch, redeeming an evil item requires the appropriate

item  creation  feat,  time,  spells,  and  experience  points,  but  it

does not require gold.

The first step toward redeeming an evil item is to temporarily

suppress  its  magical  properties  with  dispel  magic. Redemption

cannot proceed until the evil magic is suppressed. Thereafter,

the process of redemption is very similar to the process of cre-

ating a magic item from scratch. The redeemer must spend 8

hours per day in prayer or meditation with the item, must cast

any  prerequisite  spells  for  the  redemption,  and  must  spend  1

day per 1,000 gp of the redeemed items base price. The only cost

to  the  character,  besides  time,  is  XP  equal  to  1/25  of  the

redeemed items base price.

Redeemed Demon Armor: When it is redeemed, the very

shape of demon armor shifts so that its visage, while still bestial,

appears  more  like  a  snarling  hound  or  warden  archon,  or

119

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  1:56 PM  Page 120

perhaps a guardinal. It remains +4 full plate, and still allows the

wearer to make claw attacks. These attacks deal 1d10 points of

damage, strike as +1 weapons, and affect the target as if she had

been struck by a sword of conscience spell (Will negates DC 16).

The armor bestows one negative level on any nongood crea-

ture wearing it, rather than affecting nonevil creatures.

Strong enchantment; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

sword of conscience, redeemer must be of good alignment; Price

88,590 gp; Cost to Redeem 3,478 XP.

Redeemed Unholy Weapon: A redeemed unholy weapon

becomes a holy weapon.

Redeemed  Nine  Lives  Stealer: If  the  sword  is  redeemed

while it still has the ability to steal life, it becomes a +1 holy long-

sword. Otherwise, it becomes a +2 longsword with no special qual-

ities.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

holy  smite;  Price  18,315  gp  (+1  holy  longsword),  8,315  (+2  long-

Redeemed Darkskull: When a darkskull is redeemed, trac-

ings of silver forming holy symbols and words appear in its sur-

face. It emanates a hallow effect rather than unhallow, still with

no additional spell effect tied to it.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  9th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  hallow,

redeemer must be good; Price 60,000 gp; Cost to Redeem 2,400

magi can be transformed into a white one.

becomes a simple +3 heavy mace.

Moderate no school; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor;

Price 18,312 gp; Cost to Redeem 720 XP.

IRREDEEMABLE EVIL ITEMS

Redeeming a suit of demon armor is one thing; dealing with the

Hand  of Vecna or  the  Wand  of  Orcus is  another  matter  entirely.

Even a talisman of ultimate evil is an item so suffused with evil

power that the evil cannot be cast out from the item. Evil arti-

facts, like most evil outsiders, are beyond redemption. The best

option for a good character who discovers an evil artifact is to

seek its destruction.

Minor evil artifacts, like a talisman of ultimate evil or a copy of

the book of vile darkness, are no more difficult to destroy than any

other  magic  item.  Shattering  a  talisman  with  a  hammer  or

throwing a book on a fire destroys it, whether it is a minor arti-

fact or a mundane item.

Mordenkainens disjunction has a chance to destroy any major

artifact, though at great risk to the caster. As a variant rule, the

DM can decide that a good character in a consecrated or hal-

lowed location gains a +4 sacred bonus on her Will save to avoid

the devastating consequences of destroying an evil artifact by

this means.

Every  artifact  has  its  own  specific  means  of  destruction  as

well. The Dungeon Masters Guide suggests some possible means.

Others might include:

Enclose  the  artifact  in  a  voidstone  on  the  Negative  Energy

Plane.

Impale it on an icicle in the Ice Wastes, the 23rd layer of the

Abyss.

Dissolve it in a pool of poison in Smargard, the 74th layer of

the Abyss.

Grind it to dust in the clockwork gears of Mechanus.

Expose it to the radiance of the Illuminated Heaven, the pin-

nacle of Celestia.

Crush it between the two layers of Bytopia.

Cause a dead god to ingest it.

Use it to wound a specific deity.

Release the soul of every creature consumed by the artifact.

Resurrect every creature ever slain by it.

Suspend it in a fountain of flowing soulstuff.

Allow a soulmarauder to consume it.

Fill  it  with  the  grateful  tears  of  1,000  mothers  whose  dead

children have returned to life.

The powers of good smile upon those who rid the world of

great evil by destroying an evil major artifact. A party of good

characters who destroys an evil artifact can request a miracle at

no cost.

he archons, guardinals, and eladrins have their rulers,

leaders, and exemplars on the celestial planes where

good holds sway. These celestial paragons share much in

common with each other and also bear certain similari-

ties  to  their  archfiend  counterparts  on  the  Lower

Planes. At the same time, each is a unique being blessed with

powers and abilities that relate directly to that paragons area

of  interest  and  expertise.  Raziel  and  Pistis  Sophia  are  both

archon lords, but their nature and abilities are radically differ-

ent, as Raziel is the champion of paladins and Pistis Sophia is

the exemplar of monks.

While angels such as solars and planetars number among the

most  powerful  celestial  servants  of  good  deities,  the  celestial

paragons  function  independently  of  the  deities,  standing  as

powers in their own right. They have their own followers and

agents. They pursue their own agendas, which may or may not

coincide  with  the  goals  of  deities  of  like  alignment.  Short  of

deities, they are the most powerful creatures of good in existence.

They also supremely embody what it means to be good.

CELESTIAL PARAGONS

IN YOUR GAME

D&D, and certainly the Book of Exalted Deeds, assumes that the

player characters are the heroes, opposed to the forces of evil.

Given  that  premise,  the  celestial  paragons  present  problems

that the archfiends of Book of Vile Darkness do notspecifically,

how to introduce these powerful paragons of good into

your campaign without overshadowing the player char-

acters, at least before the PCs reach truly epic levels of 30

or higher.

Celestial paragons act as patrons for orders and organ-

izations such as the Fists of Raziel and the Champions

of Gwynharwyf. These organizations might act, in turn,

as patrons for player characters adventures or, at some

point,  recruit  them  as  members,  creating  opportuni-

ties for the PCs to adopt some of the prestige classes

detailed in Chapter 5.

As  the  PCs  advance  in  levels,  they  might  find

themselves entangled in the plots and corruption of

the archfiend cults described in the Book of Vile Dark-

ness. The end of the chapter describes several planar

allies that the PCs can summon or befriend. Each of

these emissaries of good belongs to an order tied to

a celestial paragon.

CHANNELING A

CELESTIAL PARAGON

In a high-level or epic-level campaign, a player

character  can  effectively  become  a  celestial

paragon.  Channel  celestial  paragon is  an  epic  spell,

available  to  epic-level  spellcasters  (as  detailed  in

the  Epic  Level  Handbook).  Epic-level  characters

might research and use this spell if they need to 121

confront an archfiend. As an alternative, you might allow char-

acters who have not quite attained epic levels (perhaps at 18th

level or so) to gain the same effect by completing a series of

arduous quests (see Questing in Chapter 2). In either case, tar-

gets of a channel celestial paragon spell each gain some aspect of

the paragons power; in effect, each player gets to run a part of

the  paragon.  All  the  players  remain  active  participants  in  a

fight that would otherwise be out of their league.

Channel Celestial Paragon

Transmutation [Good]

Spellcraft DC: 28 (see text)

Components: V, S, F, Abstinence, Sacrifice

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: You and 35 willing creatures and 1 willing celestial

paragon

Duration: 20 rounds (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (see text)

To Develop: 252,000 gp; 6 days; 10,080 XP (see text). Seeds:

Summon (DC 14, +36 DC for minimum CR 20, +60 DC for

unique individual), Transform (DC 21, +5 DC for transfor-

mation into outsider, +25 DC for transformation into

specific creature, +22 DC for minimum 26 HD). Factors:

Dismissible by caster (+2 DC), up to five additional targets

(+50 DC). Mitigating factors: Increase casting time by 9

minutes (18 DC), abstinence component (15 DC), sacri-

fice component (120 DC), one additional caster contribut-

ing a 9th-level spell slot (17 DC), channeling rather than

summoning (ad hoc 20 DC), major artifact required as

focus (ad hoc 20 DC).

By means of this mighty epic spell, you channel the power of a

celestial paragon through you body and at least 3 (but no more

than 5) of your allies. The spell effect is similar to that of the

channel  greater  celestial sanctified  spell.  However,  one  mortal

form  cannot  easily  contain  the  power  of  a  celestial  paragon

without  the  aid  of  a  deity.  Instead,  the  paragons  power  is

divided up among the participants in the spell.

Each  willing  mortal  participant  in  the  spell  gains  certain

attributes of the paragon, while other abilities of the paragon are

divided up among the participants.

Each participant gains the ability scores listed on Table 71 or

retains  his  own  ability  scores,  whichever  are  higher.  An

increase  in  Intelligence  does  not  grant  extra  skill  points.

Each  participant  gains  a  natural  armor  bonus,  deflection

bonus, and insight bonus to AC, as shown on Table 71.

Each participant gains damage reduction and spell resistance,

as shown on Table 71.

Each participant gains a singular spell-like ability, usable at

will unless otherwise indicated on Table 71.

Participants channeling a paragon of the Celestial Hebdomad

(Barachiel, Domiel, Erathaol, Pistis Sophia, Raziel, Sealtiel, or

Zaphkiel) gain the archon subtype.

Participants  channeling  a  paragon  of  the  Five  Companions

(Bharrai, Kharash, Manath, Sathia, Talisid, or Vhara) gain the

guardinal subtype.

122

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  2:53 PM  Page 123

Participants channeling a paragon of the Court of Stars (Faeri-

naal,  Gwynharwyf,  or  Morwel)  gain  the  eladrin  subtype.

As a move action, each participant can use greater teleport at

will (caster level 14th), except that it can transport only him-

self and up to 100 pounds of objects.

Each participant can speak with any creature that has a lan-

guage,  as  though  using  a  tongues  spell  cast  by  a  20th-level

cleric. This ability is always active.

Each participant in the spell must be willing, must meet the

abstinence  components  detailed  below,  and  must  have  the

same alignment as the paragon.

The Spellcraft DC and cost to develop specified above are for the

simplest version of the spell, which summons Manath, one of

the  five  guardinal  Companions.  Channeling  a  more  powerful

celestial paragon entails a higher DC and a higher cost, as shown

on Table 72.

This ritual spell requires one other spellcaster, who must con-

tribute  an  unused  9th-level  spell  slot  to  the  casting  and  who

must be one of the targets of the spell. You can add additional

spellcaster participants, each contributing a 9th-level spell slot

and reducing the spell DC by 17, to a minimum DC of 28.

Focus: You  must  have  a  major  artifact  of  good  alignment,

such as the Regalia of Good (see Chapter 6 for a description of

this item).

Abstinence  Component: You  and  each  willing  participant

must  abstain  from  intoxicants  and  stimulants  for  one  week

before  casting  this  spell.  You  and  each  willing  participant

must not be the subject of any other spell at the time you cast

this spell. You and each willing participant must not be suf-

fering from any ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain

at the time you cast this spell, including the effects of any pre-

viously cast sanctified spell.

Sacrifice: You  and  each  willing  participant  in  the  spell  each

lose one experience level.

CELESTIAL PARAGONS

AND CLERICS

Unlike the rulers of the Lower Planes, the mighty celestials

that  govern  the  Upper  Planes  do  not  desire  worship. Their

purpose,  they  protest,  is  to  encourage  goodness  and  point

mortals toward the deities of good. They do not tolerate cults

organized in their names and have no ability to grant spells

directly to mortals.

That said, all of the celestial paragons are patrons of organiza-

tions  or  even  specific  individuals  they  have  chosen  to  carry

their ideals forward in the mortal realms. Raziel, for example, is

the patron archon of paladins, and the Fists of Raziel is an organ-

ization  formed  in  the  archons  name  that  brings  together  pal-

adins  of  all  faiths,  whether  they  worship  Heironeous,  Pelor,

Moradin, Yondalla, Bahamut, or some other good deity, or even

no deity at all.

In  this  role  as  patron  of  organizations  and  individuals,  the

celestial  paragons  sometimes  petition  good-aligned  deities  to

grant particular spells and domains to their followers. For this

reason,  Chapter  6:  Magic  indicates  which  of  the  celestial

paragons are associated with the new domains presented therein,

and  each  paragons  description  in  this  chapter  likewise  details

the domains commonly chosen by clerics of the celestial orders.

While they cherish the orders that serve them, the celestial

paragons are careful to remind their followers (and sometimes

themselves) that they are not deities. To do otherwise would be

to succumb to the sin of pride.

In the interests of a balanced universe, if you have decided that

the archdevils and demon lords are actually deities with divine

rank 1 (as discussed in Book of Vile Darkness), it is probably best to

grant the same status to the celestial paragons. Even with a divine

rank,  the  celestial  paragons  remain  the  humblest  of  demigods,

still pointing mortals toward the worship of the real deities of the

campaign rather than accepting cults in their own honor.

THE UPPER PLANES

The Upper Planes are the home of all that is good, the Outer

Planes on which righteousness and justice flourish. On these

planes,  the  lawful  good  archons,  neutral  good  guardinals,

chaotic good eladrins, and angels (devas, planetars, and solars)

make  their  homes. The  souls  of  the  righteous  journey  to  the

Upper Planes when their earthly sojourn is over, there to live

eternal lives of blessed fulfillment in reward for their virtue on

earth. The  deities  of  good,  the  highest  embodiment  of  right-

eousness, dwell on these planes as well.

In the D&D cosmology, the Upper Planes include Arcadia,

Celestia, Bytopia, Elysium, the Beastlands, Arborea, and Ysgard.

The River Oceanus flows from Elysium, across the Beastlands,

to  Arborea,  providing  an  interplanar  link  among  some  of  the

Upper Planes. Magic portals connect the others, as well as allow-

ing access to the remaining multitude of planes.

Arcadia is a place of perfect law tempered only slightly with

good. It embodies perfection and harmony, with orchards of per-

fectly  lined  trees,  straight  streams  and  orderly  fields,  chiseled

mountains and geometric cities. Archons, angels, planetouched

aasimar, and mortals dwell here, alongside peaceful animals and

hive-dwelling insects. Some formians live here as well.

Celestia is a single sacred mountain rising from a sea of holy

waterthe absolute realization of law and good. Its inhabitants,

primarily archons and angels, strive toward the ideal of perfec-

tion  embodied  in  the  plane,  ascending  from  one  layer  to  the

next as they better themselves, hoping to one day reach the peak

of the Illuminated Heaven. The mystery of this highest heaven

is shrouded in impenetrable light and glory.

Bytopia is also called the twin paradises, for its two layers face

each other like two palms held together in prayer, one a pastoral

landscape and the other an untamed wilderness. In addition to

attendant  archons  and  guardinals,  celestial  animals  and  the

souls of mortal gnomes inhabit Bytopia.

Elysium is the plane of ultimate good, untainted by either

law or chaos. Elysiums brilliant beauty and vibrant sense of

life  entice  visitors  to  remain  forever,  enjoying  such  joy  and

contentment that they never desire to leave. All types of celes-

tials enjoy the blessings of Elysium, but it is the home plane

of the guardinals.

The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, filled with wild

forests, teeming swamps, and aridbut not lifelessdeserts.

The majority of the planes inhabitants, as its name suggests, are

celestial animals gifted with at least a modicum of intelligence,

eternally  living  out  the  dance  of  predator  and  prey. They  are

joined  by  some  of  the  wilder  guardinals  as  well  as  eladrins,

angels, and lillends.

Arborea  is  a  lush  and  verdant  plane  of  vibrant  energy  and

constant  anticipation.  Its  weather  is  as  unpredictable  as  its

inhabitants,  which  include  elven  spirits  as  well  as  eladrins,

angels, lillends, and fey creatures.

Ysgard  lies  between  Arborea  and  the  unceasing  chaos  of

Limbo, an epic plane where the spirits of fallen warriors wage

eternal battle on the fields of glory. Bariaurs, eladrins, and a few

devas live here as well.

As with the evil planes (as discussed in the Book of Vile Dark-

ness), you can create your own cosmology of the good planes.

You might prefer not to deal with the in-between planes of Arca-

dia,  Bytopia,  the  Beastlands,  and  Ysgard,  sticking  with  the

planes  that  directly  correlate  to  alignments.  Conversely,  you

could  have  just  a  single  plane  of  good,  called  Heaven,  where

archons, guardinals, eladrins, and angels coexist with little dis-

tinction among them (perhaps they are all called angels).

Both Manual of the Planes and Deities and Demigods offer exam-

ples of alternative cosmologies to the standard D&D cosmol-

ogy just described. Celestials might dwell in certain regions of

the Spirit World (described in Manual of the Planes and Oriental

Adventures), places that correspond to holy sites in the material

world. In either the Myriad Planes cosmology or the Winding

Road cosmology (both detailed in Manual of the Planes), there

could  be  many  Heavens,  each  with  unique  traits  and  inhabi-

tants and its own leaning toward law or chaos. It is possible that

angels  could  originate  in  a  different  Heaven  than  the  other

celestial  types  in  such  a  cosmology,  rather  than  sharing  the

same planar homes as archons, guardinals, and eladrins. Like-

wise, lillends might come from a different chaotic Heaven than

eladrins. In the Orrery cosmology, there is a lawful good plane

(the Golden Halls) and a chaotic good plane (Gods Choice), but

no neutral good plane, so the guardinals and their rulers might

not exist in this cosmology.

LAW AND CHAOS

IN THE HEAVENS

How celestials define, understand, and embody the concept of

good  varies  from  one  to  the  next.  While  an  archons  under-

standing is shaped by her adherence to the principles of law, an

eladrins is equally shaped by his chaotic viewpoint. The guardi-

nals may claim to represent pure good untainted by concerns of

law and chaos, but many would argue that their very commit-

ment to neutrality undermines their goodness.

Many celestials are fond of debating these issues with each

other,  sometimes  with  anyone  who  will  argue  with  them.  In

stark contrast to the fiends of the Lower Planes, however, these

philosophical differences among the celestials never erupt into

bloodshed. Corrupt hierarchs in good-aligned churches on the

Material  Plane  have  been  known  to  paint  vivid  portraits  of  a

war in the heavens between the forces of law and chaos, pri-

marily  as  a  means  to  justify  their  own  holy  warfare  against

other good faiths. The celestials, along with the deities of good,

recognize these inventions as manifestations of the taint of evil

among their followers. Slaughtering good creatures, even under

the guise of a just war, is never a good act, and it is unthinkable

to celestials who remain untainted by the lure of evil.

As devoted as they are to law, the archons of Celestia are far

better able to countenance the chaos of the eladrins than they

are able to stomach the evil of the Hells devils. When there has

been  real  war  in  the  heavensand  it  has  happenedit  has

been because of fallen celestials who eventually leave the Upper

Planes entirely to find new homes on the planes of evil.

THE CELESTIAL HEBDOMAD

In the days of creation, when the multiverse still quaked with

the aftershocks of birth, the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celes-

tia awaited the mortal souls who would protect and guide the

plane as the first archons. Seven blessed martyrs who had sacri-

ficed  themselves  to  the  cause  of  law  and  goodness  emerged

upon  the  young  plane  with  powerful  and  unique  formsa

mandate from Celestia itself that these beings would serve the

Seven Heavens as their immortal rulers.

The  seven  martyrs,  or  their  successors,  together  form  the

Celestial Hebdomad, the ruling council of Heaven. Similar to

the  strict  hierarchy  that  rules  the  Nine  Hells,  the  Hebdomad

governs the affairs of their home plane, supervising the archons

beneath them, marshalling the celestial armies when necessary,

and  leading  troops  to  war  against  the  forces  of  evil  when

Zaphkiel, their head, so commands.

In stark contrast to the archdevils of Hell, the seven paragons

of Celestia (sometimes referred to as tome archons by scholars

from the Material Plane) are utterly without jealousy, envy, or

pride.  Plotting  and  infighting  are  unimaginable  within  their

ranks,  and  never  have  the  armies  of  one  celestial  paragon

marched upon the fortresses of another.

Like Asmodeus in the deepest Hell, Zaphkiel is an ancient

ruler shrouded in mystery. He is wrapped in radiant light and

bathed  in  holy  power,  as  though  a  living  extension  of  the

heaven he rules. He is the only one of the original seven martyrs

who remains in his position in Celestiahis original six fellows

have all perished in the eons since their establishment. As one

of the Hebdomad falls, however, another archon somewhere in

Celestia rises to take its place, instantly assuming the form, rank,

and power of the fallen one. Most scholars believe that Zaphkiel

alone  can  promote  another  archon  to  the  Hebdomad,  which

may account, along with the exalted nature of the archons, for

the  complete  peace  and  harmony  that  prevails  among  the

ruling council.

SPECIAL QUALITIES

All members of the Celestial Hebdomad possess the following

special qualities:

Tongues (Su): The paragon can speak with any creature that

has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th).

This ability is always active.

BARACHIEL, THE MESSENGER

Large Outsider (Archon, Extraplanar, Good, Lawful)

Hit Dice: 33d8+264 (412 hp)

Initiative: +12

Speed: 40 ft. (8 squares), fly 120 ft. (perfect)

Armor Class: 42 (1 size, +12 Dex, +7 natural, +9 deflection,

+5 insight), touch 35, flat-footed 30

Base Attack/Grapple: +33/+45

Attack: Large electrified long-

sword +40 melee

Aura  of

Menace  (Su): A

righteous  aura

surrounds  the

paragon when it

fights or gets angry.

Any  hostile  crea-

ture  within  a  20-

foot  radius  of  the

paragon must make a

Will save (DC 10 + 1/2

the  paragons  Hit  Dice  +  its  Cha

modifier) to resist its effects. Those

who  fail  take  a  4  morale  penalty  on

attacks,  AC,  and  saves  for  one  day.  If  an

affected  creature  makes  a  successful  hit

against  the  paragon,  that  creature  (only)

can attempt a new saving throw. A creature that makes a suc-

cessful saving throw against the effect cannot be affected

again by that paragons aura for one day.

Barachiel, the

Messenger

Indelible Imprint (Su): When one of the Celestial Hebdo-

mad is slain, the dying paragon releases holy energy to brand

its  murderer  for  all  time. The  instant  the  paragon  dies,  all

creatures  within  100  feet  who  have  dealt  damage  to  the

paragon within the past day must make a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 the paragons Hit Dice + its Cha modifier). Those that suc-

ceed  suffer  no  ill  effects.  Creatures  that  fail  receive  an

unsightly rune upon their faces that instantly identifies them

to any lawful good outsider as a murderer of a member of the

Hebdomad. The  mark  may  be  removed  with  a wish or  miracle

spell.

Magic  Circle  Against  Evil  (Su): A  magic  circle  against  evil

effect  always  surrounds  the  paragon,  identical  with  the  spell

(caster level = paragons Hit Dice). The effect can be dispelled,

but the paragon can create it again during its next turn as a free

action.

Summon Archons (Sp): Twice per day, a member of the Celes-

tial  Hebdomad  can  automatically  summon  4d10  lantern

archons, 2d4 sword archons, 1d4 trumpet archons, 1d2 throne

archons, or another member of the Hebdomad.

Teleport (Su): As a move action, the paragon can use greater

teleport at  will  (caster  level  14th),  except  that  the  paragon  can

transport only itself and up to 100 pounds of objects.

This empyreal figure appears as a 9-foot-tall androgynous human with

silver skin and dark violet eyes. Great wings covered with silver feath-

ers grace his shoulders. He wears a flowing violet robe adorned with

tiny  motes  of  light  that  glow  like  stars.  He  wields  a  longsword  that

crackles with electricity and carries a burnished silver trumpet.

Barachiel (bah-RAY-kee-ehl) rules Lunia, the bottom layer of the

great heavenly mountain, also known as the Silver Heaven. He

commands  Celestias  defenses  against  incursion,  though  he

rarely  has  much  to  do  in  that  capacity.  In  addition,  he  is  the

herald and messenger of the archon paragons, even visiting the

Material Plane on occasion to deliver messages of the utmost

importance.  He  leads  the  trumpet  archons  and  is  a  patron  of

mortal heralds as well.

The Citadel of Stars is Barachiels home on the shore of the

Silver  Sea.  A  towering  fortress  with  gleaming  white  marble

walls, the Citadel entertains an almost constant stream of trum-

pet archons coming in and going out on their missions across

the planes.

Combat

Barachiel  prefers  to  use  lightning  bolts  in  combat,  but  faced

with enemies immune to electricity, he turns to his spells and

spell-like  abilities.  He  does  not  hesitate  to  use  his  summon

archons ability if he needs help.

Any  weapon  Barachiel  wields  is  treated  as  good-aligned

and  lawful-aligned  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Electrify  Blade  (Su): Any  metal  weapon  Barachiel  wields

crackles  with  electrical  energy.  He  normally  attacks  with  a

Large longsword but can use any metal weapon in this manner.

If  he  drops  the  weapon  (or  is  disarmed),  it  loses  its  electrical

power.  A  weapon  charged  in  this  manner  deals  an  additional

2d6 points of electricity damage on a successful melee attack. In

addition, Barachiel can use the weapon to make touch attacks to

deliver only the 2d6 points of electricity damage.

When  wielded  normally,  Barachiels  lightning  blade  over-

comes the damage reduction of other creatures as though it were

a natural weapon (using Barachiels damage reduction 15/evil).

As a touch attack, the lightning blade can affect any creature that

is harmed by magical electricity. The effect can be dispelled, but

Barachiel can renew it the next round as a free action.

Lightning  Stroke  (Su): When  holding  a  metal  object

(including a lightning blade), Barachiel can project a stroke of

lightning  toward  any  foe  within  100  feet.  He  must  make  a

ranged touch attack to hit the target, dealing 10d6 points of elec-

tricity damage with a successful attack.

Spells: Barachiel can cast divine spells as a 20th-level cleric

with the Good, Herald, and Law domains.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Trumpet  (Su):  Barachiels  trumpet,  like  that  of  a  trumpet

archon, produces music of utter clarity, piercing beauty, and, if

Barachiel wills it, paralyzing awe. All creatures except archons

within 100 feet of the blast must make a DC 35 Fortitude save or

be  paralyzed  for  1d4  rounds.  If  the  trumpet  is  ever  stolen,  it

becomes a chunk of useless lead until Barachiel can recover it.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Aura of Menace (Su): Will DC 35 negates.

Indelible Imprint (Su): Will DC 35 negates.

Sample Champion of Barachiel: Ziamiral

Ziamiral (zee-ah-meer-AHL) the sword archon is a dedicated ser-

vant  of  Barachiel  who  can  be  called  using  the  planar  ally or

planar binding spell.

When  not  summoned  to  the  Material  Plane  to  fight  evil,

Ziamiral serves in one of Barachiels standing armies, charged

with defending Celestia against attack. Since such attacks are

extremely rare, she spends an inordinate amount of time preen-

ing and setting all her feathers just so.

Ziamirals  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any  weapons  she

wields,  are  treated  as  good-aligned  and  lawful-aligned  for  the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Ziamiral: Sword  archon  fighter  1;  CR  12;  Large  outsider

(archon, extraplanar, good, lawful); HD 11d8+22 plus 1d10+2;

Includes a 3 armor check penalty for the +3 angelic breast-

Armor Class: 42 (1 size, +5 Dex, +7 natural, +12 deflection,

plate.

Armblades  (Ex): As  a  free  action,  Ziamiral  can  mold  the

flesh of her forearms, hardening and sharpening organic matter

into the form of powerful magic blades. She wields the blades

like longswords, and they gain the properties of +2 holy flaming

longswords.

Ziamiral can shift back to her normal hands as a free action.

The armblades cannot be disarmed or sundered, and they auto-

matically  assume  limb  form  upon  the

archons death.

Discorporating  Dive  (Su): Three  times

per  day,  Ziamiral  can  attempt  to  destroy  a

living enemy with a powerful dive attack, lit-

erally  flying  through  its  opponent  arm-

blades-first,  tearing  apart  its  body  and

sending  its  soul  to  imprisonment  in  the

Seven Mounting Heavens.

Resolve  a  flying  charge  as  normal.  If

Ziamiral fails to damage its opponent, the

discorporating  dive  attack  is  wasted.  If

damaged, however, the target must make

a DC 20 Fortitude save. Those who suc-

ceed the Fortitude save suffer no further

effect beyond the damage of the attack.

(The save DC is Constitution-based and

includes  the  +2  bonus  for  Ziamirals

Ability Focus feat.)

If  the  save  fails,  the  attack  utterly

annihilates  the  victims  body,  killing  it

instantly.  Further,  the  victims  soul  is

bound  to  a  great  prison  in  the  Seven

Mounting Heavens of Celestia, where

it  remains  until  the  archons  that

manage the celestial donjon see fit to

release it.

Release  involves  bartering

with  Barachiel,  with  some

quest for the cause of law and

goodness  being  the  most

common price.

Spell-Like  Abilities: At

layer of Celestia. Embodying all that is serene and sincere, she

Pistis  Sophia  can  cure  her  own

wounds.  She  can  cure  up  to  60  hp

each  day,  and  she  can  spread  this  healing

Sample Champion of Pistis Sophia: Drusulai

Drusulai (DRUH-suh-lye) is a dwarven paladin dedicated to Pistis

Sophia who can be called using the planar ally or planar binding

spell. This paladin of Moradin frequently guards the armories of

Erackinor, a dwarven manse on Solania.

Drusulai  met  Pistis  Sophia  once  and  was  awestruck  by  her

presence.  The  two  exchanged  pleasantries,  after  which  Pistis

Sophia knelt down and kissed the dwarf s waraxe, transforming

it  into  a  righteous  weapon  (see  Weapon  Special  Qualities  in

Chapter  6:  Magic)  that  additionally  provides  guidance  to  its

wielder in the form of lyrical riddles.

Organization: Solitary

Challenge Rating: 28

Treasure: Triple standard

Alignment: Lawful good

Advancement: 

A 9-foot-tall celestial being stands before you. He is muscular with plat-

inum-white skin, flames for hair, and bright, ruby-red eyes. He wears

an ornate mithral breastplate and carries a mithral shield in one hand.

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/26/03  2:57 PM  Page 133

In the other, he grasps a great longsword. Great wings with reddish-gold

and white feathers sprout from his broad shoulders.

Raziel  (RAY-zee-ehl)  rules  Mertion,  the  fifth  layer  of  Celestia,

known as the Platinum Heaven. Among his celestial peers, he is

called the Firestar for his judicious wrath. Raziel offers guidance

to paladins and devotes his energy to protecting the defenseless.

Raziel  opposes  tyranny  and  oppression  with  a  ferocity  that  is

both startling and inspiring.

When  legendary  paladins  seek  the  wisdom  of  the  Firestar,

they  come  to  Empyrea,  the  City  of  Tempered  Souls.  Raziel

doesnt maintain a stronghold but can be found in any one of the

citys great hospitals and infirmaries, providing spiritual guid-

ance and protection to the clerics and patients.

Combat

Raziel rides a celestial charger (unicorn) named Temperion into

battle. It has maximum hit points (211 hp) but otherwise con-

forms  to  the  statistics  presented  on  page  250  of  the  Monster

Manual.

The Firestar wears a majestic mithral breastplate and carries a

heavy mithral shield in one hand and an enormous holy sword

in the other.

Any weapon Raziel wields is treated as good-aligned and

lawful-aligned  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Smite  Chaos/Evil  (Su): Five  times  per  day,  Raziel  may

attempt to smite a creature that is either chaotic or evil (or both)

with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier

(+6) to his attack roll. If the attack hits a chaotic or evil target,

Raziel deals an additional 20 points of damage; if the target is

both  chaotic  and  evil,  the  damage  is  doubled  (40  points).  If

Raziel accidentally smites a creature that is neither chaotic nor

evil, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

Spells: Raziel can cast divine spells as a 20th-level cleric with

the  Good,  Law,  and  War  domains,  and  can  also  cast  paladin

spells as cleric spells.

Sample Champion of Raziel: Evansheer

Evansheer (EH-vehn-sheer) is an astral deva Fist of Raziel who

can be called using a greater planar ally or greater planar binding

spell.

Evansheer hunts fiends with ruthless fervor, sells their body

parts (teeth, hides, claws, and hearts) to interested (if dubious)

buyers, and gives the proceeds to the underprivileged or home-

less.  For  every  fiend  she  kills,  the  astral  deva  avenges  one

angelic ally whos perished fighting evil on the battlefield. Her

favored weapon is Zaethwar, an intelligent +5 holy spiked chain

forged  from  adamantine  (see  Intelligent  Items  in  Chapter  6:

Magic for a description of this weapon).

Whenever Evansheer smites

evil,  her  critical  rolls  are

automatically  successful

(so every threat is a critical

hit).  Furthermore,  her

weapon  is  considered  holy

(if  it  isnt  already)  and  deals

+2d6  points  of  holy  damage

against evil creatures. This addi-

tional  damage  does  not  stack

with the benefit of the Sanctify

Martial Strike feat, but it stacks

with  the  additional  holy

damage  Evansheer  deals

from the smite.

circle against evil and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a

but Evansheer can create it again as a free action on its next turn.

(The defensive benefits of the circle are not included in Evan-

Sealtiel (see-AHL-teel) is a patron of

the warden archons and the ruler

of  Jovar,  the  Glittering  Heaven

and  Celestias  sixth  layer.  He

commands  an  impressive  stand-

ing  army  of  archons  and  other

is  also  charged  with  pre-

venting  impure  beings

from  reaching  Chronias,

the  seventh  and  highest

layer of Celestia.

Sealtiels  empyreal  fortress

of  Pax  Exaltea  dominates  the

sixth terrace of Yetsira, a zig-

gurat-city with seven ter-

races. Warden archons

come  to  Vanguard

to  receive  new

tiel  also  entertains

countless celestial beings seeking enlightenment as

part of their quest to reach the seventh layer of Celes-

tia, the Illuminated Heaven.

Sealtiel, the

Combat

In battle, Sealtiel wields a massive greatclub licked by

Aura of Menace (Su): Will DC 39 negates.

Defensive  Stance  (Ex): Five  times  per  day,

Sealtiel can become a stalwart bastion of defense.

In  this  defensive  stance,  he  gains  phenomenal

strength and durability, but he cannot move from

the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength,

+4  to  Constitution,  a  +2  resistance  bonus  on  all

saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.

The  increase  in  Constitution  increases

Sealtiels  hit  points  by  2  points  per  level,  but

these  hit  points  go  away  at  the  end  of  the

defensive stance when his Constitution score

drops back 4 points. These extra hit

points are not lost first the way tem-

porary hit points are. While defending,

Sealtiel  cannot  use  skills  or  abilities  that

would require him to shift his position, such

as Move Silently or Jump. Sealtiels defensive

stance  lasts  for  19  rounds.  He  may  end  the

defense  voluntarily  before  this  limit.  Taking  the

stance takes no time itself, but Sealtiel can only do

so during his action.

Fortify (Su): Sealtiel strengthens whatever building or forti-

fication  he  occupies,  regardless  of  its  size.  Walls,  doors,  and

objects  within  or  attached  to  the  structure  have  double  the

normal hardness and hit points, and their break DCs increase by

+20.  Objects  within  the  stronghold  also  gains  a  saving  throw

against  spells  when  unattended  as  if  they  were  magic  items

(save bonus +12). In addition, any good character defending the

fortification gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resist-

ance bonus on saves. Such characters also gain spell resistance

25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures. Further-

more, they are protected from possession and mental influence

as per the protection from evil spell.

Indelible Imprint (Su): Will DC 39 negates.

Sample Champion of Sealtiel: Arkareon

Arkareon  (ar-KAH-ree-on)  is  dedicated  to  Sealtiel  and  can  be

called  using  the  lesser  planar  ally or  lesser  planar  binding spell.

Arkareon serves in Sealtiels army and has a profound affinity

for nature. He has died seventeen times fighting the forces of evil

and recalls each death in excruciating detail. Moved by the devas

dedication and tireless sacrifice, Sealtiel has consistently returned

Arkareon to life with a true resurrection spell. Of course, Arkareon

has killed hundreds of fiends during his seventeen lives. Slender

and agile, he has milky-white skin and silver hair and eyes.

Arkareon: Male movanic deva; CR 9; Medium outsider (extra-

planar, good, lawful); HD 6d8+12; hp 45; Init +8; Spd 40 ft., fly 90

ft. (good); AC 28, touch 16, flat-footed 24; Base Atk +6; Grp +10;

steel shield.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willaid, consecrate, continual flame,

create food and water, death ward (DC 18), detect evil, discern lies, poly-

morph, prayer, protection from arrows (DC 16); 3/dayatonement,

plane shift, remove curse (DC 17), remove fear (DC 15); 1/daycom-

mune, raise dead. Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-

based.

Divine  Equilibrium  (Ex):  Arkareon  is  immune  to  the

effects  of  negative-dominant  or  positive-dominant  planar

energy traits (see Adventuring on Other Planes in the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Heavenly Deflection (Su): Once per round as a free action,

Arkareon can deflect a ranged attack or spell by batting it away

with  his  +1  flaming  greatclub.  When  a  ranged  attack,  ray,  or

single-target spell would ordinarily hit or affect Arkareon, he

can make a Reflex save against a base DC of 20. If the ranged

attack  has  an  enhancement  bonus,  the  DC  increases  by  that

amount. If the attack is from a spell, the spells level is added to

the  base  DC.  If  Arkareon  succeeds,  he  deflects  the  attack.

Deflected spells are negates as if counterspelled. Arkareon must

be aware of an attack to have a chance to deflect it.

Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks made or effects created

by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to

AC  and  a  +4  resistance  bonus  on  saving  throws  to  anyone

within 20 feet of Arkareon. Otherwise, it functions as a magic

circle against evil and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a

radius of 20 feet (caster level 18th). This aura can be dispelled,

but Arkareon can create it again as a free action on its next turn.

(The  defensive  benefits  of  the  circle  are  not  included  in

Arkareons statistics, above.)

Soothing Presence of Nature (Ex): Arkareons divine spirit

is pleasing to inhabitants of the natural world. Unless magically

compelled  to  do  so,  no  plant  or  animal  will  attack  Arkareon.

Possessions: Mithral shirt, +1 animated heavy steel shield, +1 flam-

ing  greatclub,  moonblood  warpaint  (see  Special  Materials  in

Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment).

Personality Traits: Charitable, idealistic, and zealous.

beautiful yet androgynous figure standing 10 feet tall, with golden skin

and metallic, platinum-white wings. Warm light surrounds it, and its

expressions are both soothing and kind.

Zaphkiel (ZAF-kee-ehl) presides over the seventh layer of Celes-

tia, the Illuminated Heaven of Chronias. Zaphkiel embodies the

perfect good, and only the most exalted creatures can stand in

his presence without being consumed.

Zaphkiel watches over all of Celestia, sending advice and pro-

viding wise counsel to the other members of Hebdomad regard-

ing their dealings with mortals and

other  celestial  beings.  Zaph-

kiel  also  protects  and  nur-

tures the innocent spirits of

stillborn  babies  and  sacri-

ficed children.

Zaphkiel, the Watcher

Although  Zaphkiel

clearly has some interest

in advancing less-perfect

beings,  Zaphkiels  true

goals  remain  inscrutable.

Only  the  gods  and  the

other  Hebdomad  mem-

bers  have  actually  seen

Zaphkiel. All other beings

who  have  encountered  or

perceived  the  archon  have

either perished for their folly

or  achieved  such  a  state  of

goodness  that  their  essences

have  joined  with  Celestia  itself.

Combat

Zaphkiel does not wield weap-

ons  or  wear  armor,  relying

on  his  holy  touch  and

emanations  (see  below)

to quell evil foes.

Zaphkiels  melee

and  ranged  attacks

are  treated  as  good-

aligned and lawful-aligned for the pur-

pose  of  overcoming  damage  reduction.

Emanations  (Su): Each  of  the  stigmata

upon  Zaphkiels  hands  can  produce  a  magic  ray

once a round, even when the archon is attacking phys-

ically  or  moving  at  full  speed  (but  not  when  casting

spells). Both rays have a range of 150 feet. Zaphkiel may use one

or the other, or one of each ray, but may not use the same ray

twice in the same round.

Ray of Suffering: This ray wracks the victim with the pain and

anguish endured by the archon during its mortal life, dealing

15d10 points of damage. A successful DC 39 Will save reduces

the  damage  by  half.  The  ray  of  suffering  cannot  reduce  the

target to less than 1 hit point.

Ray of Soothing: This ray charges its target with the palliative

power  of  righteousness  experienced  by  the  archon  during

apotheosis. This infusion of holy power immediately ends any

and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target:

temporary  ability  damage  (but  not  permanent  ability  drain),

blindness  (including  dazzled  effects),  confusion  or  insanity,

daze,  deafness,  fatigue  and  exhaustion,  feeblemindedness,

nausea,  and  poison.  It  also  cures  15d10  hit  points  of  damage.

The ray of soothing does not remove negative levels, restore

permanently  drained  levels,  or  restore  permanently  drained

ability scores.

Holy  Touch  (Su): A  touch  of  Zaphkiels  hands  deals  3d6

points of holy damage to evil creatures. Undead and evil out-

siders take 6d6 points of damage instead. Evil creatures hit-

ting Zaphkiel with natural

weapons  or  unarmed

attacks take holy damage

as  though  hit  by  his

touch attack.

Spells: Zaphkiel

can  cast  divine  spells

as  a  20th-level  cleric

with the Good, Heal-

ing,  and  Law  do-

mains.

Turn  Undead  (Su): Zaphkiel  turns  undead  as  a  35th-level

cleric. His Knowledge (religion) skill grants him a +4 bonus on

turning checks.

Alternate  Form  (Su): As  a  standard  action,  Zaphkiel  can

assume one of two forms: an incorporeal maelstrom of golden

energy or a 10-foot-tall archon. In maelstrom form, he flies at

a speed of 90 feet (good maneuverability) and can pass through

solid  objects.  He  can  only  attack  and  be  harmed  in  archon

form.

Aura of Menace (Su): Will DC 39 negates.

Indelible Imprint (Su): Will DC 39 negates.

Positive Energy Aura (Su): An undead creature with 25 HD

or fewer that comes within 10 feet of Zaphkiel is automatically

affected as if he had turned it, while undead creatures with 15

HD or fewer are destroyed. Undead with total cover relative to

Zaphkiel are unaffected.

Champions of Zaphkiel

Zaphkiel  has  no  known  champions  who  fight  in  his  name,

although some might argue that the other six members of the

Hebdomad are, in some sense, his champions.

TALISID AND THE

FIVE COMPANIONS

The guardinals have no record of their origin. They have been

the protectors of Elysium for all of the planes recorded history.

For  as  long  as  Elysium  has  known  the  guardinals,  there  have

been  the  Celestial  Lion  and  his  Five  Companions,  exemplars

and epitomes of their respective kind. In contrast to the rela-

tively unchanging ranks of the archons, however, members of

the Companions come and go, assuming the office when they

are fit for it and abdicating when they are no longer fit. Talisid,

the current Celestial Lion, has held that position far longer than

normal, and few can even remember the name of his predeces-

sor,  but  the  Five  Companions  have  all  relatively  recently

ascended to their positions as representatives of their respective

kinds.

Talisid  and  the  Five  Companions  are  rather  more  like  an

adventuring  partythough  an  exalted  onethan  the  ruling

council of the Celestial Hebdomad or the loosely feudal court of

the eladrins. The Celestial Lion and his friends wander the fields

of Elysium, solving problems as they arise and smashing evil if

it dares rear its ugly head in their domain. They each hear peti-

tions and resolve disputes among guardinals of their kind, lead

companies into battle, and solve problems on their own initia-

tive when necessary.

All the actions of Talisid and the Companions are guided by

the principles of goodness, in particular the ideal of friendship

they embody in their work together. The Five Companions is

more than an empty title: the leaders of the guardinals are the

closest  of  companions,  bound  by  a  fierce  devotion  to  one

another  that  puts  mere  family  loyalty  to  shame. They  are  not

without discord, as the interests of the different kinds of guardi-

nals may at times conflict, but they argue and clash as the dear-

est of friends, holding themselves and each other to the highest

standards of love and good.

SPECIAL QUALITIES

The Celestial Lion and his Five Companions share the following

special qualities:

Lay on Hands (Su): As the paladin class feature, except that

each day, a guardinal can heal an amount of damage equal to its

full normal hit points.

Speak with Animals (Su): This ability works like speak with

animals  (caster  level  8th)  but  is  a  free  action  and  does  not

require sound.

Tongues (Su): The Celestial Lion or one of the Five Compan-

ions can speak with any creature that has a language, as though

using  a  tongues spell  (caster  level  20th). This  ability  is  always

active.

This mighty figure looks like a poised, 9-foot-tall lion-headed man with

a muscular build. He has golden fur, a regal mane of golden hair, and

dark, penetrating eyes. He wears exquisite robes and absently strokes his

chin whiskers with one sharp claw.

Although  proud  of  his  accomplishments  and  those  of  his

beloved Companions, Talisid (TAL-eh-seed) does not allow pride

or other emotions interfere with his mission to protect and aid

the  residents  of  Elysium.  His  love  for  the  Blessed  Fields  has

grown  in  the  thousands  of  years  he  has  served  as

Celestial Lion, and he takes great delight in its

many natural wonders.

The wisest and most powerful of leon-

als, Talisid regular travels the four layers

of  Elysium  but  spends  most  of  his

time  on  Amoria,  the  topmost  layer.

He  often  assumes  an  animal  form

when traveling alone in the wilder-

ness,  taunting  unlawful  hunters

with  his  trackless  step  and  wood-

land  stride  abilities.  He  maintains

no  permanent  residence,  often

shacking up with friends he has

made  throughout  the  Blessed

Fields. A king among guardinals,

Talisid prefers to think of himself

as a humble servant of the people

and  demands  no  special  treat-

ment or consideration.

Combat

Talisid  has  little  need  for  armor

or weapons, preferring to spring

into  battle  by  pouncing  on  foes

and tearing them to pieces with

his sharp claws.

Talisids  natural  weapons  and

any  weapons  he  wields  are

treated  as  good-aligned  for  the

purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Talisid

hits  a  Medium  or  smaller  oppo-

nent  with  his  bite  attack,  he  deals

normal lethal damage and attempts

to  start  a  grapple  as  a  free  action

without  provoking  an  attack  of  op-

portunity.  If  he  gets  a  hold,  he  can

attempt  to  rake  on  the  same  round.  There-

after,  Talisid  has  the  option  to  conduct  the

grapple normally, or simply use his mouth to hold the opponent

(20  penalty  on  grapple  check,  but  Talisid  is  not  considered

grappled).  In  either  case,  each  successful  grapple  check  he

makes  during  successive  rounds  automatically  deals  bite

damage.

Pounce  (Ex):  If  Talisid  charges,  he  can  make  a  full  attack

(including a rake attempt, as described below), even though he

has moved.

Rake  (Ex):  If  Talisid  gets  a  hold  on  an  opponent  (see

Improved  Grab,  above),  he  can  make  two  rake  attacks  (+55

melee) with his hind legs for 1d8+16 points of damage each. If

Talisid pounces on an opponent, he can also rake.

Roar (Su): Talisid can roar up to five times per day. Each roar

releases a blast in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of a

holy word spell and deals an additional 4d6 points of sonic damage

(Fortitude save DC 37 negates). The DC is Charisma-based.

Spells: Talisid casts spells as a 20th-level druid.

Bastion  of  Good  (Su): As  a

free  action,  Talisid  can  surround

himself  with  a  20-foot-radius  nimbus

of light. This acts as the bastion of good spell

(see Chapter 6: Magic).

Resist  Natures  Lure  (Ex): Talisid  gains  a  +4  bonus  on

Talisid, the Celestial Lion

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Thousand Faces (Su): While in his natural form, Talisid can

alter his appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell (caster

level 20th).

Trackless  Step  (Ex): Talisid  leaves  no  trail  in  natural  sur-

roundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a trail

if so desired.

139

Wild Shape (Su): At will, Talisid can turn himself into any

animal, plant, or good-aligned magical beast of Tiny to Huge size

or  an  elemental  of  Small  to  Huge  size.  Aside  from  having  no

usage limit, this ability works the same as a druids wild shape

ability.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Talisid may move through any sort of

natural undergrowth at his normal speed and without suffering

damage or other impairment.

(see Chapter 5: Prestige Classes).

Goldcrown is dedicated to Talisid and can be called using the

autumnal leaves. Instead of wings, it has a third arm with which

it can make slam attacks. Goldcrowns exalted animal compan-

iona  golden-scaled  constrictor  snake  named  Corruscoils

around one of the treants lower boughs, using its Hide skill to

go unnoticed. The treant has taught his serpentine companion

four tricks: attack, come, defend, and fetch.

Animate Trees (Sp): Goldcrown can animate trees within 180

feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full

round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a

speed  of  10  feet  and  fights  as  a  normal  treant  in  all  respects.

Animated trees lose their ability to move if Goldcrown is inca-

pacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise similar

nerability to fire that Goldcrown has.

a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.

Lions Pounce (Ex): Goldcrown can make a full attack at the

end of a charge.

Scent  (Ex): Goldcrown  can  detect  approaching  enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Trackless  Step  (Ex): Goldcrown  leaves  no  trail  in  natural

surroundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a

trail if so desired.

Wild  Shape  (Su):  Goldcrown  can  turn  himself  into  any

Small or Medium animal and back again five times per day. The

effect lasts for 6 hours or until Goldcrown changes back. Chang-

ing form is a standard action and doesnt provoke an attack of

opportunity.  See  the  druids  wild  shape  class  feature  for  addi-

tional information.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Goldcrown may move through any

sort  of  undergrowth  at  his  normal  speed  and  without  taking

damage  or  suffering  any  other  impairment.  However,  thorns,

briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipu-

lated to impede motion still affect him.

Possessions: Orb  of  storms,  gem  of  seeing,  2 beads  of  force,  pearl  of

power (1st).

Personality  Traits: Effervescent,  courteous,  and  immodest.

Improved  Grab  (Ex): To  use  this  ability,  Corrus  must  hit

with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Smite  Evil  (Su): Once  per  day,  Corrus  can  make  a  normal

melee attack to deal 3 extra points of damage against an evil foe.

Scent (Ex): Corrus can detect approaching enemies, sniff out

the Sky Duchess

Treasure: Triple standard

Alignment: Neutral good

Advancement: 

This tall, lithe woman has powerful wings instead of arms. Flecks of

green speckle her snow-white feathers. Her face is more human than

avian, but her hair resembles a feathery cowl, and her eyes are bright

gold. Her feet end in talons that have an emerald-green luster and look

as sharp as diamonds. Numerous small birds flutter around her, obvi-

ously drawn to her powerful presence.

The voice of the avorals, Sathia (SAY-thee-ah) is also a patron and

muse for gifted painters and sculptors. She possesses a sharp eye

for detail and has created a number of masterful paintings and

wood  sculptures.  Most  of  all,  she  enjoys  time  spent  with  the

Companions  and  soaring  in  the  skies  of  Elysium.

Sample Champion of Sathia: Zyd

Zyddumar  Dragoncrest  (Zyd  to  his  friends)  is  dedicated  to

Sathia and can be called using the planar ally or planar binding

spell.

Instead of wings, Zyd was born with a startling precognitive

gift  that  lets  him  receive  images  of  impending  evil,  many  of

them quite disturbing. The images first started appearing when

he was a young boy, and Sathia taught him how to render these

141

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  8:16 AM  Page 142

images on canvas. Zyd is periodically summoned to the Mater-

ial Plane to paint portentous scenes for kings and other influ-

ential  figures.  Although  he  cant  foresee  every  sign  of

impending evil, Zyd usually receives images of the most dire or

threatening.

Zyd never travels anywhere without an easel, canvas, brushes,

and pigments.

A 6-foot-tall figure stands before you, his head crowned with a mag-

nificent set of curved rams horns. His shaggy fur varies in color from

red to gold to autumn yellow on his bare chest, and his large cloven

feet are ash-black in color. A wry yet endearing smile plays across his

wise face.

Teerlyn  has  a  slim  yet  muscular  body  covered  with  short

red fur with golden highlights. Her long, curved horns bear

alternating  rings  of  gold  and  black.  Her  favorite  tactic  is  to

draw  an  animal  from  her  bag  of  tricks before  leaping  into

melee.

Manath (man-ATH) is the newest member of the Five Compan-

ions, only recently replacing the curmudgeonly Duke Rhanok.

The new duke of the cervidals feels he has much to learn from

Talisid and the other Companions, but if he has any doubts

about his ability to stand in Rhanoks hoofprints, he isnt

showing  them.  Manath  has  brought  a  keen  wit  and

sense  of  fun  to  the  Companions,  charming  the

others with his colloquial manner and prancing

tongue.

Combat

Although fearless in combat, Manath prefers to

resolve  disputes  peacefully,  using  friendly

jokes  instead  of  weapons  to  disarm  oppo-

nents.  When  charm  and  diplomacy  fail,  he

brings his horns and hooves to bear.

Manaths  natural  weapons  and  any

weapons he wields are treated as good-

aligned  for  the  purpose  of  overcom-

ing damage reduction.

Powerful  Charge  (Ex): Manath

can lower his head and charge an oppo-

nent, striking with his deadly horns. In addi-

tion to the normal benefits and hazards of a

charge,  this  tactic  allows  him  to  make  a

single  gore  attack  that  deals  2d6+16

points of damage.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  will

bless, command  (DC 20), detect poison,

light;  1/dayhold  person  (DC  21),

magic missile, suggestion (DC 22).

Caster  level  20th.  The  save

DCs  are  Charisma-based.

Ho r n   Po we r s   ( Su ) :

Manath can deliver any of sev-

eral  effects  by  a  touch  of  his

horns.  He  can  negate  any

disease  or  poison  (as  the

spells  neutralize  poison and

remove  disease)  in  the  crea-

ture touched, dispel an illusion (as

a  targeted  dispel  magic spell,  except

that it affects only spells of the Illusion school and is automati-

cally successful), or dismiss (as a dismissal spell) a summoned,

conjured,  or  extraplanar  creature.  Each  of  these  horn  powers

can be used at will as a standard action. Except as noted, all these

abilities  function  as  their  corresponding  levels.  Caster  level

and  emotional  spirit.  Her  fellow  Companions  know  that  she

takes her commitment to equinals and Elysium with absolute

seriousness and that she privately weeps when confronted by

suffering that she cannot herself allay.

Vhara  adores  flowers  of  all  sorts  and  enjoys  receiving  bou-

quets as gifts. When not traveling with the other Companions

on one of Talisids adventures, she dwells in a spacious manse on

Amoria. Her manse, Sienna Rise, stands atop a hill surrounded

by fields of flowers, and Vhara is seldom seen without a small

troupe of doting servants, including a male half-elf bard with a

small golden harp and a female elf sorcerer with a predilection

for speaking in rhymes and riddles.

Combat

In  battle,  Vhara  relentlessly  smashes  foes  with  her  great

hooves. Armor and weapons are beneath her. She tries to sur-

round herself with as many enemies as possible before

using  her  whinny  ability  and  Whirlwind

Attack feat.

Vharas  natural  weapons  and

any  weapons  she  wields  are

treated as good-aligned for the

purpose  of  overcoming  dam-

age reduction.

Whinny  (Su): Once  per

emit  a  piercing  shriek  that

affects  all  nonguardinals  in  a

20-foot-radius  spread.  Crea-

tures  with  30  HD  or  fewer  are

stunned  for  1d6  rounds,

while creatures with more

than 30 HD are deafened for

1d6  rounds.  A  successful  DC

either  effect.  This  is  a

sonic effect. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Standing  15  feet  tall,  this  statuesque  woman  has  a  horselike  head,

shoulders  of  heroic  proportion,  and  long  arms  ending  in  thick,  iron-

hard fingers that make creditable hooves when curled into fists. Her legs

are even more horselike, with a long foot ending in a true hoof. Her face

is long and narrow. A long, neatly groomed mane runs from the crest of

her head down to the center of her back. She is both lovely and poised.

Behind an aloof and somewhat domineering faade, Vhara (VAH-

rah), the duchess of the equinals, hides a profoundly generous

Sample Champion of Vhara: Imodocen

Imodocen (ih-moh-DOH-sen) is dedicated to Vhara and can be

called using the planar ally or planar binding spell.

Imodocen and Vhara have a rocky relationship. Vhara relies

on Imodocen as a messenger, but the impetuous asura is prone

to wanderlust and finds excuses to wage battles on the Material

Plane  and  elsewhere.  Vhara  is  unwilling  to  make  Imodocen

someone  elses  responsibility,  nor  does  she  want  to  make  the

but clearly refuses to be reined in.

Treasure: Triple standard

Alignment: Neutral good

Advancement: 

A werewolflike creature with topaz eyes steps from the shadows on all

fours. Measuring 10 feet long, its lithe, muscular body is covered in a

neatly groomed black and brown fur. It smiles broadly, revealing rows

of sharp, pearly-white fangs.

The paragon of lupinals, Duke Kharash (kah-RASH) is the clos-

est Companion to Talisid, sharing the Celestial Lions passion

for the hunt as well as his love for the untamed wilderness. The

two are nigh inseparable except when Talisid chooses to enter

a populated area, at which time Kharash usually opts to remain

in the wild. Although sly of tongue and not exactly shy, Kha-

rash doesnt care much for large groups or accolades. He adores

children but is inexplicably awkward around them. His ability

to remain out of sight coupled with his willingness to let Tal-

isid  speak  on  his  behalf  in  public  has  earned  Kharash  the

moniker Talisids Shadow, and the lupinal duke doesnt seem

to mind.

An undisputed master of the hunt, Kharash trusts his senses

and intuition. He doesnt fall easily into traps, and he studies his

enemies carefully before moving in for the kill. He maintains no

permanent residence. When traveling apart from Talisid and the

Companions, Kharash is usually joined by a pack of his trusted

lupinals.

Combat

Kharash prefers to study his foes for a few rounds before spring-

ing into battle, giving him the chance to use his death strike.

When  fighting  alongside  Talisid  and  the  other  Companions,

Kharash  usually  attacks  the  most  vulnerable  opponent  first,

hoping to take it out quickly before moving on to tougher prey.

Kharashs natural weapons and any weapons he wields are

treated as good-aligned for the purpose of over-

coming damage reduction.

Death Attack (Ex): If Kharash studies

his  victim  for  3  rounds  and  then

makes a sneak attack with a natu-

ral  weapon  that  successfully

deals  damage,  the  sneak

attack has the additional

effect of possibly either

paralyzing  or  killing

the

target.  While

studying the victim,

Kharash  can  take

other  actions  so

long  as  his  at-

tention  stays

focused on the

target and the

target  does

not  detect

him  or  rec-

ognize him

as  an  ene-

my.  If  the

victim  of

such an at-

tack  fails  a

DC  28  For-

titude  save

against the kill

effect,  she  dies.

If  the  saving

throw  fails  against

the paralysis effect, the

victims  mind  and  body  become

enervated, rendering her helpless and unable

to act for 1d6+10 rounds. If the victims saving throw suc-

ceeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once Kharash has

completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack

within the next 3 rounds. If the death attack is attempted and

fails (the victim makes her save) or if Kharash does not launch

the  attack  within  3  rounds  of  completing  the  study,  3  new

rounds of study are required before he can attempt a new death

attack.

Favored Enemies (Ex): As the ranger class feature, except

Kharash gains bonuses as follows: +8 against evil outsiders, +4

against undead, +2 against aberrations, +2 against elementals,

and +2 against dragons.

Fear Aura (Ex): When Kharash howls, every creature with-

in  600  feet  (except  other  guardinals)  that  can  hear  it  must

make a Will saving throw (DC 33). On a failure, a creature with

32 HD or fewer becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds; a creature

with 33 HD or more becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. Success

leaves the creature unaffected. Once a creature has either been

affected by this ability or made a successful save, it cannot be

affected by Kharashs howl again for 24 hours. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Kharash, the Stalker

Improved  Grab  (Ex): If

Kharash hits an opponent that is at least

one size category smaller than him with a bite attack, he deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action

without  provoking  an  attack  of  opportunity.  Kharash  has  the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use his jaws

to  hold  the  opponent  (20  penalty  on  the  grapple  check,  but

Kharash is not considered grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check he makes during successive rounds auto-

matically deals bite damage.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This ability functions as the rogues sneak

attack ability. Kharash deals +9d6 points of damage with a suc-

cessful sneak attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblink, blur (DC 19), darkness,

disguise self, ethereal jaunt; 3/daycone of cold (DC 22), cure light

wounds (DC 18), fly (DC 19), magic missile; 1/dayfind the path

(DC 23). Caster level 20th. Save DCs are Charisma-based.

Trip (Ex): if he hits with a bite attack, Kharash can attempt to

trip his opponent as a free action (see Trip in Chapter 8 of the

Players Handbook) without making a touch attack or provoking

an  attack  of  opportunity.  If  the  attempt  fails,  the  opponent

cannot react to trip Kharash.

Dodge Missiles (Ex): This ability operates like the Deflect

Arrows  feat,  except  Kharash  can  dodge  any  missile,  need  not

have his hands free (Kharash is dodging, not deflecting), and

can attempt to dodge every missile launched at him.

Scent (Ex): Kharash can detect approaching enemies, sniff

out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Wild Empathy (Ex): This ability works exactly as the druids

wild empathy class feature. Kharash receives a +4 exalted bonus

on wild empathy checks to sway the attitudes of animals and

good-aligned magical beasts (including, but not limited to, blink

dogs, unicorns, pegasi, and animals with the celestial template)

because he has the Animal Friend exalted feat.

Sample Champion of Kharash: Serradus

Serradus (seh-RAH-dus) is a lupinal dedicated to Kharash and

can be called using the greater planar ally or greater planar bind-

ing spell.

When not summoned to the Material Plane to fight evil, Ser-

radus  usually  runs  in  Kharashs  hunting  pack  on  Elysium.

Serraduss  natural  weapons  and  any  weapons  he  wields  are

treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction.

Serradus: Male lupinal stalker of Kharash 10; CR 15; Medium

environments), Swim +16; Alertness, Favored of the Compan-

ions,  Nemesis  (evil),  Point  Blank  Shot,  Precise  Shot,  Ranged

Smite Evil, Track.

Favored EnemyEvil (Su): Serradus gains evil creatures of

all  kinds  as  a  favored  enemy.  He  gains  a  +1  bonus  on  Bluff,

Listen,  Sense  Motive,  Spot,  and  Survival  checks  when  using

these skills against evil creatures. He also gains a +1 bonus on

weapon damage rolls against evil creatures.

Serradus may apply the benefits of the Nemesis feat to this

ability, allowing him to sense evil creatures within 60 feet and

deal +1d6 points of holy damage on weapon attacks.

Fear Aura (Ex): When Serradus howls, every nonguardinal

within 600 feet who can hear it must make a DC 21 Will save.

On a failure, a creature with 17 HD or fewer becomes panicked

for 4d6 rounds; one with 18 HD or more becomes shaken for

4d6  rounds.  Success  leaves  the  creature  unaffected.  Whether

the save succeeds or fails, a creature cannot be affected by Ser-

raduss howl again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Serradus hits an opponent that is at

least one size category smaller than itself with a bite attack, he

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action  without  provoking  an  attack  of  opportunity.  Each  suc-

cessful grapple check he makes during successive rounds auto-

matically deals bite damage.

Smite Evil (Su): Three times per day, Serradus may add a +4

bonus to his attack roll and deal 10 extra points of damage to an

evil foe. This bonus stacks with favored enemy bonuses. If he

accidentally smites a nonevil foe, the smite has no effect and is

still  used  up  for  that  day.  Serradus  may  use  this  ability  with

ranged attacks (thanks to his Ranged Smite Evil feat).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblink, blur (DC 14), darkness,

disguise self, ethereal jaunt; 3/daycone of cold (DC 17), cure light

wounds (DC 13), fly (DC 15), magic missile. Caster level 8th. The

save DCs are Charisma-based.

Trip (Ex): If Serradus hits with his bite attack, he can attempt

to trip his opponent as a free action (see Trip in Chapter 8 of the

Players Handbook) without making a touch attack or provoking

an  attack  of  opportunity.  If  the  attempt  fails,  the  opponent

cannot react to trip Serradus.

Dodge Missiles (Ex): This ability operates like the Deflect

Arrows feat, except that Serradus can dodge any missile and he

need not have his hands free. (He is dodging, not deflecting.)

This ability is usable three times per round.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): Serradus can use the Hide skill

even while being observed. With at least one-quarter cover or

one-quarter  concealment,  he  can  hide  from  view  even  if

another character is watching.

Lay on Hands (Su): As a paladin class feature, except that

each day, Serradus can heal an amount of damage equal to his

full normal hit points.

Scent (Ex): Serradus can detect approaching enemies, sniff

out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Scent  of  Evil  (Su):  Serradus  can  detect  evil  opponents

within 30 feet by their scent of evil. If the opponent is upwind,

the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. A

strong  aura  of  evil  can  be  detected  at  twice  these  ranges.  An

overwhelming  aura  of  evil  can  be  detected  at  triple  normal

range.

Speak with Animals (Su): This ability works like speak with

animals (caster level 8th) but is a free action and does not require

sound.

Track Evil (Su): Serradus can use the Track feat to track an

evil creature by its lingering evil aura, making a Survival check

to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no

matter the surface). The DC for tracking increases by 2 every 10

feat. Serradus can ignore the effects of surface conditions and

poor visibility.

Challenge Rating: 28

Treasure: Triple standard

Alignment: Neutral good

Advancement: 

This bipedal bear has thick snow-white fur, eyes like shards of blue ice,

and massive paws. She stands 18 feet tall and wears immaculate robes

of the finest quality.

Bharrai (buh-RYE) is the matriarch of the ursinals.

Some  ursinals  refer  to  her  as  Mother  Bear,  for

she  treats  others  of  her  kind  like  cherished  chil-

dren, taking great interest in their endeavors and

exploits and fearing for them when they leave Ely-

sium to study magic and fight evil abroad.

When not accompanying Talisid and the other

Companions  on  some  important

escapade,  Bharrai  resides  in  a  great

lodge  overlooking  a  small  lake,

all nestled between four moun-

tains  on  Eronia  (the  second

layer of Elysium). The region

enjoys  hot  summers  and

harsh  winters.  During  the

summer, Bharrai teaches her

fellow  ursinals  about  the

importance  of  living  in

harmony with nature. In

the winter, she turns the

lodge into a college of wiz-

ardryan  isolated  re-

treat  where  ursinals

and  visiting  wiz-

ards can study and

learn  magic  under

her supervision.

Combat

A formidable combatant, Bhar-

rai  prefers  to  cast  spells  than

engage in melee combat.

Bharrais  natural  weapons

and  any  weapons  she

wields  are  treated  as  good-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming

Bharrai, the Great Bear

damage reduction.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Bharrai hits an opponent that is at

least one size category smaller than himself with a claw attack,

she deals normal lethal damage and attempts to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. There-

after, Bharrai has the option to conduct the grapple normally or

simply use one claw to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grap-

ple  check,  but  Bharrai  is  not  considered  grappled).  In  either

case, each successful grapple check she makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals claw damage.

Nature-Friendly Spells (Su): This ability allows Bharrai to

change the composition of any energy-based spell she casts to

something that is not destructive to nature. The spell must have

the  acid,  cold,  electricity,  or  fire  descriptor,  and  Bharrai  may

choose  to  deal  nonlethal  damage  instead  of  lethal  damage

against animals and plants targeted or otherwise affected by the

spell.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): While on Elysium, Bharrai can react

to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.

She  retains  her  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  even  when

caught flat-footed. She loses this ability on other planes.

of the sentinels of Bharrai (see Chapter 5: Prestige Classes). He

THE COURT OF STARS

The noble, passionate, and mercurial eladrins call the Olympian

Glades of Arborea their home. Shifting between its three layers

is a demiplane known as the Court of Starsthe seat of power

of the eladrin people. The Court of Stars drifts about Arborea

like an autumn leaf on a pool and can only be reached when the

eladrin monarch, Queen Morwel, wishes it so. Portals leading to

and  from  the  Court  of  Stars  can  manifest  anywherewithin

the  halls  of  Corellon  Larethians  Court  on  Arvandor,  beneath

the eternal sea of Aquallor, somewhere in the white deserts of

Mithardir, or any other location Morwel fancies. No power on

Arborea seems capable of opening or closing a portal without

Morwels  consent.  Rumor  has  it  that  one  of  Arboreas  fabled

attractions, the Fountain of Beauty, which has the power to tem-

porarily improve ones Charisma, can only be reached from the

Court  of  Stars,  and  that  Morwel  requires  some  kind  of  gift

before granting passage.

Morwels  demiplane  resembles  an  autumnal  sylvan  forest

under a starlit sky. Time does not pass here, so creatures living in

the demiplane (including plants) never age, hunger, or thirst.

They  do  eat,  drink,  and  sleep,  but  purely  for  enjoyment.  Fey

creatures  living  in  the  forest  lead  visitors  to  Morwels  palace,

which  thrusts  up  from  the  heart  of  the  woodland,  its  spires

breaking through the forest canopy. Within the crystalline walls

of her palace, Morwel entertains guests, hosts parties, and dis-

cusses pressing issues with her eladrin advisors and consorts.

Queen Morwel can seem flighty and pretentious at times, but

she has the best interests of her people at heart. She does not

rule alone, relying heavily on the counsel of her dear consorts.

Over the centuries, Morwel has taken many consorts. Currently,

she has two: a male tulani named Faerinaal and a female bralani

named Gwynharwyf. Her affection for both is beyond measure.

Faerinaal is a master politician and a shrewd judge of charac-

ter.  Morwel  relies  on  his  guidance  to  handle  serious  matters

affecting her darling subjects. Gwynharwyf is a fierce and dev-

astating  warrior  whose  tireless  crusade  against  evil  helps  to

unite the eladrin people.

SPECIAL QUALITIES

Queen Morwel, Faerinaal, and Gwynharwyf share the following

special qualities:

Bardic Music (Su): They can use the bardic music ability as

20th-level bards. Each can use or maintain concentration on one

such ability per round as a free action, requiring no instrument

other than his or her unearthly voice.

Protective Aura (Su): As a free action, Morwel or one of her

consorts can generate a 20-foot-radius nimbus of light. This acts

as a double-strength magic circle against evil and as a minor globe of

invulnerability (caster level 20th). The aura can be dispelled, but

Morwel or any of her consorts can create it again as a free action

on its next turn.

Tongues  (Su): Queen  Morwel  and  her  consorts  can  speak

with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues

spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.

Challenge Rating: 31

Treasure: Triple standard

Alignment: Chaotic good

Advancement: 

This woman bears a passing resemblance to an elf, although her beauty

is awesome and otherworldly. She wears a shimmering mantle of stars

that flicker out before touching the ground, and she slices her brilliant

rapier through the air with playful confidence.

Morwel (MOR-wel) has always ruled the eladrins. No eladrin can

recall any monarch coming before her, and no eladrin can imag-

ine the Court of Stars without her. To them, she has always been.

Since time does not pass in the Court of Stars, it is conceivable

that Morwel is many thousands of years old, although no one

dares ask her to reveal her age.

Morwel never leaves her demiplane, and some fear that if she

did leave, the demiplane would collapse and be destroyed for-

ever. However, she welcomes and entertains a steady stream of

visitors and ardent admirers.

Although she usually appears in humanoid form, Morwel can

take the form of a 4-foot-diameter globe of scintillating, multi-

colored light.

Combat

Morwel  wields  her  brilliant  rapier with  blinding  speed  and

incredible finesse.

Any weapon Morwel wields is treated as chaos-aligned and

good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Blinding  Beauty  (Su): This  ability  operates  continuously,

affecting  all  humanoids  within  60  feet  of  Morwel.  Those

who look directly at her must make a DC 43 Fortitude

save or be blinded permanently as though by the blind-

ness spell. Morwel can suppress or resume this ability

as a free action. The DC is Charisma-based.

Gaze  (Su): Slay  evil  creatures  of  8  HD  or

fewer, range 60 feet, DC 43 Will save negates.

The DC is Charisma-based.

Prismatic Light Ray (Su): In globe form,

Morwel  can  project  a  ray  of  light  with  a

range of 300 feet (caster level 20th). Morwel

must  choose  the  color  of  the  ray  before

making each attack roll. During rounds

when  she  makes  multiple  attacks,

Morwel can change the color of the

ray  after  every  attack.  A  creature

struck by a ray must make an appro-

priate saving throw (DC 43) and suf-

fers the effects listed below (the

save  DC  is  Charisma-based).

Red: 20d6 points

of  fire  damage

(Reflex  half )

invisibility,  spectral  hand,  Tashas  hideous  laughter,  touch  of  idiocy;

sional  anchor,  rainbow  pattern; 5thbreak  enchantment,  feeble-

pelled,  but  Morwel  can  reactivate  them

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this

book.

Sword of Light (Su): Morwel can create a

+6 brilliant energy rapier at will as a free action.

The  rapier  deals  an  additional  2d6

points of positive energy damage

to  evil  creatures.  If  Morwel

dies or loses physical contact

with the rapier, it disappears

instantly.

prestidigitation,  read  magic; 1stcharm  person,  expeditious  retreat,

Unearthly  Beauty  (Su):

Morwel  can  evoke  this  ability

once per day. Any noneladrin within 30 feet

of  Morwel  who  looks  directly  at  her  must

make  a  DC  45  Will  save  or  die.  The  DC  is

Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Alternate  Form  (Su): Queen  Morwel  can

shift between her humanoid and globe forms as a standard

action. In humanoid form, she cannot fly or use her pris-

matic light rays, but she can use her gaze attack and spell-

like  abilities,  make  physical  attacks,  and  cast  spells.  In  globe

form, she can fly, use her prismatic light rays, and use spell-like

abilities, but she cannot cast spells or use her gaze attack. The

globe form is incorporeal, and Morwel has no Strength score

while in that form. While incorporeal, Morwel can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weap-

ons  (though  her  damage  reduction  still  applies  as  well),  and

spells,  spell-like  abilities,  or  supernatural  abilities.  She  is

immune  to  all  nonmagical  attack  forms.  Even  when  hit  by

spells or magic weapons, she has a 50% chance to ignore any

151

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  8:20 AM  Page 152

damage  from  a  corporeal  source

(except  for  positive  energy,  nega-

tive energy, force effects, such as

magic  missile,  or  attacks  made

with  ghost  touch weapons).

Morwel  remains  in  one

form  until  she  chooses  to

assume a new one. A change

in form cannot be dispelled,

nor  does  Morwel  revert  to

any  particular  form  when

killed.  A  true  seeing  spell,

however,  reveals  both  forms

simultaneously.

Sample Champion of

Morwel: Krune

Krune  is  a  half-celestial

androsphinx  dedicated  to

Queen  Morwel  who  can  be

called  using  the  planar  ally

or planar binding spell. A fre-

quent visitor to the Court of

Stars,  Krune  thinks  the

world of Morwel and cant

stop  talking  about  her

beauty  and  wisdom.  He

keeps  a  small,  harmless

white rat named Argyn as a

traveling  companion  and

plaything.  During  combat,

Argyn  hides  under  Krunes  armor,

giving  it  100%  cover  against  melee  and

ranged  attacks  and  protecting  it  against

Krunes roar.

Krunes  natural  weapons  are  treated  as

magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  over-

coming damage reduction.

Advancement: 

This breathtakingly handsome, elflike man moves with otherworldly

grace and casts a mischievous smile in your direction. He wears an elab-

orate midnight-blue robe adorned with silver stars and arcane symbols.

As Morwels consort, Faerinaal (FAY-reh-nayl) provides company

and counsel to the queen. He also oversees the defense of the

Court  of  Stars  should  it  ever  fall  under  attack.  Faerinaals  last

sworn duty is to liberate any eladrins captured by the forces of

evil. (It was during such a mission to the Abyss that Faerinaals

predecessor, Vaeros, perished.)

Faerinaal adores Morwel more than any other creature and

would gladly give his life to protect hers. His alternate form is

that of a 4-foot-radius scintillating sphere of rainbow-hued light.

Combat

Faerinaal  wields  a  +4  brilliant  holy  longsword in  battle.  Any

weapon Faerinaal wields is treated as chaos-aligned and good-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Dream Ray (Su): In globe form, Faerinaal can fire a corus-

cating ray of light with a range of 300 feet. The ray deals 1d6

points  of  temporary  Charisma  damage  with  a  successful  hit.

Any nonevil creature reduced to 0 Charisma by the dream ray

falls  into  a  dream-filled  coma.  An  evil  creature  reduced  to  0

Charisma falls into a nightmare-wracked coma and takes 1d10

points of damage plus an additional 1d10 points of damage per

hour spent in the comatose state. A creature awakens from its

coma  if  its  Charisma  is  raised  to  1  or  higher. This  is  a  mind-

affecting effect.

Gaze (Su): Slay evil creatures of 5 HD or fewer, range 60 feet,

Will DC 37 negates. The DC is Charisma-based.

Spells: Faerinaal casts spells as an 18th-level wizard.

The following abilities are always active on Faerinaal (caster

level  20th):  blessed  sight*,  detect  law,  detect  magic,  magic  circle

against evil (20-foot radius), and true seeing. These abilities may be

dispelled, but Morwel can reactivate them as a free action.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Sword of Light (Su): Faerinaal can create a +4 brilliant energy

holy longsword at will as a free action. If he dies or loses physical

contact with the sword, the sword disappears instantly.

Alternate  Form  (Su): Faerinaal  can  shift  between  his

humanoid  and  globe  forms  as  a  standard  action.  In  humanoid

form, he cannot fly or use his dream rays, but he can use his gaze

attack  and  spell-like  abilities,  make  physical  attacks,  and  cast

spells. In globe form, he can fly, use his dream rays, and use spell-

like abilities, but he cannot cast spells or use his gaze attack. The

globe  form  is  incorporeal,  and  Faerinaal  has  no  Strength  score

while in that form. While incorporeal, Faerinaal can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons

(though her damage reduction still applies as well), and spells,

spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. He is immune to all

nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weap-

ons, he has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal

source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects,

such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons).

Faerinaal remains in one form until she chooses to assume a

new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does Faeri-

naal revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing spell,

however, reveals both forms simultaneously.

Sample Champion of Faerinaal: Karasel

Karasel (KAR-ah-sel) is a lillend troubadour of stars dedicated to

Faerinaal. She can be called using the greater planar ally or greater

planar binding spell.

When  not  providing  musical  accompaniment  for  Morwels

and Faerinaals frequent dances, Karasel entertains the fey crea-

tures that live in the Morwels forest demiplane. Occasionally,

Faerinaal sends her to the Material Plane to search for Hwyrr,

the Clarion Harp (see Intelligent Items in Chapter 6: Magic).

Karasel wears golden barrettes shaped like treble clefs in her

flowing  golden-brown  hair  and  has  a  silver  teardrop  tattoo

under her right eye. She is rarely seen without her silver flute and

her  celestial  familiar  (a  pretty,  butterfly-winged  coure  eladrin

named Twilight).

ning Reflexes, Knight of Stars, Silent Spell, Words of Creation.

Bardic Music: Karasel has the bardic music ability of a 9th-

level bard.

Constrict (Ex): Karasel deals 2d6+5 points of damage with a

successful  grapple  check.  Constricting  uses  her  entire  lower

body,  so  she  cannot  take  move  actions  when  constricting,

though she can still attack with her sword.

Holy  Cacophony: As  an  additional  bardic  music  effect,

Karasel can create a song that hampers evil creatures. Any evil

creature within 30 feet of Karasel must succeed on a Concen-

tration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell or use a spell-

like  ability.  Using  the  Words  of  Creation  with  this  effect

increases the save DC to 20 + spell level and deals 8d4 points of

nonlethal damage to Karasel. Holy cacophony is a sonic, mind-

affecting ability.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Karasel must hit

with a tail slap attack. She can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If

she  wins  the  grapple  check,  she  establishes  a  hold  and  can

constrict.

Spells: Karasel can cast spells as a 6th-level bard.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdancing lights, detect evil, detect

magic, faerie fire; 3/daymagic missile, sleep (DC 14). All save DCs

are Charisma-based.

Alternate Form (Su): Twilight can assume the form of an

incorporeal ball of light at will. This transformation counts as

a  standard  action.  In  this  form,  she  can  be  harmed  only  by

other  incorporeal  creatures,  +1  or  better  magic  weapons,

spells,  spell-like  abilities,  and  supernatural  abilities.  In  this

form, Twilight has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a

corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made

with  ghost  touch  weapons.  In  this  form,  Twi-

light can pass through solid objects, but not

force  effects,  at  will.  While  incorporeal,

her attacks ignore natural armor, armor,

and  shields,  but  deflection  bonuses

and  force  effects  work  normally

against  them.  In  this  form,  she

always  moves  silently  and

cannot  be  heard  with  Listen

checks if she doesnt wish to

be.  While  incorporeal, Twi-

light  sheds  light  if  she

wishes,  providing  illumina-

tion  with  any  radius  she

wishes  up  to  30  feet.  Chang-

ing  the  amount  of  light  she

sheds is a free action that Twi-

light  can  perform  once  per

round.

Magic  Circle  against  Evil

(Su):  A  magic  circle  against  evil

effect always surrounds Twilight,

as the magic circle against evil spell

(caster level 8th). The effect can be

dispelled, but Twilight can create it

again during her next turn as a free

action. (The defensive benefits of

the circle are not included in Twi-

lights statistics above.)

Skills: Coures have a +4 racial

bonus on Hide and Move Silently

checks  (included  in  the  statistics

above).

Possessions: Dagger.

Personality  Traits: Faithful,  shy,  and

standoffish.

Gwynharwyf,

the Whirling Fury

A short, stocky elf stands ready for battle. Her hair is a wild

silver-white mane, and her eyes are as green as jade. She has

a  tanned  complexion  and  clutches  a  pair  of  gleaming  scimitars  that

seem to reflect every color of the rainbow.

A  patron  of  good  barbarians,  Gwynharwyf  (gwin-HAR-wif )  is

Queen Morwels loyal champion and a barbarian of unparalleled

ferocity. As one of Morwels consorts, she attends to the queens

desires  when  not  leading  barbarian  hordes  in  the  eternal

struggle against evil.

155

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  8:21 AM  Page 156

Gwynharwyf can also assume the form of a whirlwind of glit-

tering sand.

Combat

Gwynharwyf  rages  before  entering  battle,  cutting  her  foes  to

ribbons with her holy scimitars.

Gwynharwyf s  natural  attacks  and  any  weapons  she  wields

are treated as chaos-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction.

Mighty Rage (Ex): Gwynharwyf can rage 6 times per day, but

no more than once in a given encounter. During her rage, she

gains  a  +8  bonus  to  her  Strength  and  Constitution,  and  a  +4

morale bonus on Will saves; she also takes a 2 penalty to AC.

Gwynharwyf does not become fatigued at the end of her rage;

otherwise, this ability functions as the barbarians rage ability.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblur (DC 21), charm person (DC

20), gust of wind (DC 21), mirror image, wind wall; 2/daylight-

ning bolt (DC 22), cure serious wounds (DC 22). Caster level 20th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Whirlwind Blast (Su): When in whirlwind form, Gwynhar-

wyf  can  attack  with  a  scouring  blast  of  wind,  dealing  12d6

points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 33 half ). The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Alternate  Form  (Su): Gwynharwyf  can  shift  between  her

humanoid  and  whirlwind  forms  as  a  standard  action.  In  hu-

manoid form, she cannot fly or use her whirlwind blast, but she

can use her spell-like abilities and her weapons. In whirlwind

form, she can fly, make slam attacks and whirlwind blast attacks,

and use spell-like abilities.

Gwynharwyf  remains  in  one  form  until  she  chooses  to

assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor

does Gwynharwyf revert to any particular form when killed. A

true  seeing spell,  however,  reveals  both  forms  simultaneously.

Improved  Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): Gwynharwyf  cannot  be

flanked except by a rogue of at least 30th level (see the Epic Level

Handbook).

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): Gwynharwyf  can  react  to  danger

before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains

her  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  even  when  caught  flat-

footed.

Sample Champion of Gwynharwyf: Sirocco

Sirocco (SEER-ah-koh) is a bralani dedicated to Gwynharwyf. He

can be called using the lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding

spell.

Sirocco throws himself into battle with verve. In particularly

bloody fights, he tries to lighten the mood with a few jokes or

jibes, usually at his enemys expense. He is easily smitten with

women who enjoy a good fight as much as he does.

Sirocco: Male bralani; CR 6; Medium outsider (chaotic, eladrin,

15), gust of wind (DC 16), mirror image, wind wall; 2/daylight-

ning bolt (DC 17), cure serious wounds (DC 17). Caster level 6th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Whirlwind  Blast  (Su): When  in  whirlwind  form,  Sirocco

can attack with a scouring blast of wind, dealing 3d6 points of

damage  in  a  20-foot  line  (Reflex  DC  16  half ). The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Alternate Form (Su): Sirocco can shift between humanoid

and whirlwind forms as a standard action. In humanoid form,

he  cannot  fly  or  use  his  whirlwind  blast,  but  he  can  use  his

spell-like abilities and weapons. In whirlwind form, he can fly,

make slam attacks and whirlwind blast attacks, and use spell-

like abilities.

Sirocco  remains  in  one  form  until  he  chooses  to  assume  a

new  one.  A  change  in  form  cannot  be  dispelled,  nor  does

Sirocco revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing

spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.

Possessions: Bracers of armor +2, +1 holy scimitar, +1 holy composite

longbow (+4 Str bonus), quiver of 30 normal arrows.

Personality  Traits: Charming,  mischievous,  and  impetuous.

he creatures in this section are not monsters in the tradi-

tional sense and only rarely appear as adversaries to player

characters, unless those player characters are evil or pursuing

evil ends. Much more often, they serve as allies or advisors to

good-aligned player characters, whether summoned to the

Material Plane by means of a planar ally spell, acquired with the

Celestial Familiar feat, or through more traditional means.

THE DEATHLESS TYPE

Deathless is a new creature type, describing creatures that have

died but returned to a kind of spiritual life. They are similar in

many  ways  to  both  living  creatures  and  undead.  However,

while undead represent a mockery of life and a violation of the

natural order of life and death, the deathless merely stave off

the inevitability of death for a short time in order to accom-

plish  a  righteous  purpose.  While  undead  draw  their  power

from the Negative Energy plane, the deathless are strongly tied

to the Positive Energy plane, the birthplace of all souls. In fact,

the  deathless  are  little  more  than  disincarnate  souls,  some-

times wrapped in material flesh, often incorporeal and hardly

more substantial than a soul in its purest state.

Features

Skill points equal to (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per

Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die.

Traits

No Constitution score.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, com-

pulsions,  phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale  effects).

Not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal  damage,  or

ability  drain.  Immune  to  damage  to  its  physical

ability  scores  (Strength,  Dexterity,  and  Constitu-

tion)  as  well  as  fatigue  and  exhaustion  effects.

Unlike  undead,  the  deathless  are  subject  to

energy drain. Like living creatures, deathless are

harmed by negative energy and healed by posi-

tive energy.

Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude

save, except for energy drain attacks, effects that

also  work  on  objects,  and  harmless  effects.

Cannot use the run action.

Uses  Charisma  modifier  for  Concentration

checks.

12-sided Hit Dice.

Base attack bonus equal to 1/2 of total Hit Dice (as wizard).

otherwise  enrage  the  deity.  An  aleax  looks  like  its  intended

victim except that its eyes glow bright gold or silver.

An aleax does not exist until it is called into being by a deity.

The deity imbues the aleax with a fragment of his or her con-

sciousness  before  sending  it  to  the  location  of  its  intended

victim. When it appears, the aleax may utter a few brief words in

the language of the deity (which may or may not be understand-

able to the victim), stating the nature of the transgression and

insisting  that  its  victim  submit  to  punishment.  After  the

decree is spoken, the aleax attacks without quarter or

mercy. No discussion or plea is heeded.

A deity may have only one aleax at any given

time,  and  an  aleax  cannot  be  sent  after  more

than  one  creature.  A  deity  cannot  send  a  new

aleax to exact vengeance against a character who

has killed the deitys aleax once before.

CREATING AN ALEAX

An aleax has all of the statistics, abilities, qualities,

racial  traits,  and  possessions  of  its  intended  victim

(referred  to  hereafter  as  the  base  creature)  except  as

noted below:

Type: Changes to construct.

Hit Dice: Changes to 10-sided Hit Dice. An aleax of

Small size or larger gains a number of additional hit

points based on its size: Small 10, Medium 20, Large

30, Huge 40, Gargantuan 60, or Colossal 80. These

bonus  hit  points  do  not  change  when  the  aleax

shapechanges into a larger or smaller form.

Initiative: The aleax gains a +1 insight bonus

on initiative checks.

Armor Class: The aleax gains

a  +2  perfection  bonus  to

AC.

Not  affected  by  raise  dead and  reincarnate spells  or  abilities.

Resurrection and true resurrection can affect the deathless if they

are willing. These spells turn deathless creatures back into the

living creatures they were before becoming deathless.

Evil  clerics  can  turn  or  destroy  deathless  creatures  as  good

clerics turn or destroy undead. Good clerics and paladins can

rebuke, command, or bolster deathless creatures as evil cler-

ics rebuke, command, or bolster undead.

Deathless creatures gain the same benefits from

consecrate and hallow as undead do from desecrate

and unhallow, and they are hindered by dese-

crate and unhallow as undead are by con-

secrate and  hallow. Hide  from

undead and  undeath  to  death

also  work  against  deathless.

Detect undead and deathwatch also

reveal  deathless,  and  allow  the

caster  to  distinguish  deathless

creatures from undead. Evil casters can be

stunned  by  overwhelming  auras  of  death-

less creatures as good casters can be stunned

by  overwhelming  undead  auras.  Use  the

undead line in the detect evil spell descrip-

tion  when  deathless  are  in  the  area  of  a

detect  good spell.  Deathless  are  healed  by

disrupt  undead and  damaged  by  unholy

water  as  undead  are  by  holy  water.

Deathless are not affected by disrupt-

ing  weapons.  Spells  that  have

greater than normal effect against

undead creaturesincluding chill

touch,  magic  stone,  searing  light,

sunbeam, sunburst,  and wall  of

firedo  not  have  these  en-

hanced effects against death-

less  creatures.  Deathless

take  only  1d6  points  of

damage  per  two  caster

levels from searing light.

Spells  such  as  com-

mand undead, control

undead,  create  un-

dead,  create  greater  undead,

and  halt  undead do  not  affect  or  create

deathless creatures.

ALEAX

Physical manifesting vengeance, a deity sends forth an aleax

to  punish  and  redeem  those  who  stray  from  the  dictates  of

their alignments, who fail to make the proper sacrifices, or who

Special Abilities: The aleax gains all of the intended victims

special abilities plus the following:

Searing Light (Sp): Once per round, as a standard action, an

aleax may fire rays of light from its eyes. The rays duplicate

the effect of a searing light spell (caster level equals the aleaxs

Hit Dice).

Shapechange (Sp): An aleax can shapechange at will, as the spell.

An aleax typically has one or two favored alternate forms reflec-

tive  of  the  deity  it  serves.  (For  example,  Bahamuts  aleax  has

been known to take the form of a gold dragon.) The aleax retains

its  extraordinary  and  spell-like  abilities  regardless  of  the  new

form. Caster level 20th.

158

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  8:22 AM  Page 159

Sudden Death (Ex): If the aleax kills its intended victim, the

victims spirit is instantly transported to the aleaxs deity, who

gives the fallen character one last chance to barter for its life.

The deity can demand a service, a sworn oath, a magic item or

other precious item, or some similar sacrifice. If the character

does not pay, his spirit is destroyed, and the character cannot be

returned to life by any means.

If the intended victim destroys the aleax in battle, the aleax

and all of its equipment vanishes. However, some portion of the

divine  essence  infusing  the  aleax  merges  with  the  character,

who  immediately  gains  the  following  benefits:  a  +2  bonus  to

Wisdom, a +1 insight bonus on all initiative checks, a +2 perfec-

tion bonus to AC, and spell resistance equal to the aleaxs Hit

Dice. The deitys wrath is annulled, and no more attacks will be

made against that character for whatever offense begot the aleax

(regardless of whether that character is now acting in an appro-

priate manner).

Special Qualities: The aleax gains all of the intended victims

special qualities plus the following:

Construct Traits: An aleax has immunity to poison, magic sleep

effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy

effects,  mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,  phan-

tasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It

is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. Cannot heal

damage, but can be repaired. An aleax is immediately destroyed

when reduced to 0 hp or less. Since it was never alive, an aleax

cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft. and low-light

vision.

Fast  Healing  5  (Ex): The  aleax  heals  5  points  of  damage  per

round. Fast healing is otherwise like natural healing. Fast heal-

ing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suf-

focation, and it does not allow the aleax to regrow or reattach

severed body parts.

Singular Enemy (Ex): Although the aleax is visible to all, only

its intended victim can harm it. Attacks made by other creatures

are rebuffed, dealing no damage and hindering the aleax in no

way.

Spell Resistance (Ex): The aleax has spell resistance equal to 10

+  its  Hit  Dice  or  the  spell  resistance  of  its  intended  victim,

whichever is higher.

True Seeing (Sp): An aleax can use true seeing at will, as a free

action. Caster level 20th.

Abilities: An aleax has no Constitution score.

Skills and Feats: An aleax has the skills and feats of the base

creature.

Archons  speak  Celestial,  Infernal,  and  Draconic.  However,

they can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their

tongues ability.

Combat

Archons never attack without provocation. They avoid harming

other good creatures if they can, using nonlethal spells or sub-

dual attacks if possible. An angry archon can be wrath incarnate,

however.

Archons prefer to meet a foe head-on if it is prudent to do so.

If outmatched, they do what they can to even the odds (often

employing hit-and run tactics or standing off and engaging a foe

with magic before moving into melee).

Archon  Traits: An  archon  possesses  the  following  traits

(unless otherwise noted in a creatures entry).

Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Aura  of  Menace  (Su):  A  righteous  aura  surrounds  archons

that  fight  or  get  angry.  Any  hostile  creature  within  a  20-foot

radius  of  an  archon  must  succeed  on  a  Will  save  to  resist  its

effects.  The  save  DC  varies  with  they  type  of  archon,  is

Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail

take a 2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until

they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A crea-

ture  that  has  resisted  or  broken  the  effect  cannot  be  affected

again by the same archons aura for 24 hours.

Immunity to electricity and petrification.

+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.

Magic  Circle  against  Evil  (Su): A  magic  circle  against  evil

effect  always  surrounds  an  archon  (caster  level  equals  the

archons Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the circle are

not included in an archons statistics block.)

Outsider Traits: An archon cannot be raised, reincarnated, or

resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection

spell can restore life). Darkvision 60 ft.

Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the

spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport

only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.

Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that

has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level 14th).

This ability is always active.

ARCHON

When a lawful good deity wishes to interact with its subjects in

the Material Plane, it most often does so through angelic inter-

mediaries  known  as  archons.  Lantern,  hound,  and  trumpet

archons appear in the Monster Manual, for these archons are the

most  frequently  encountered  by  mortal  adventurers.  Those

who  venture  to  the  Seven  Mounting  Heavens  of  Celestia  or

those with access to planar ally spells might come into contact

with the more powerful archons presented here.

Owl archon

An owl archons natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as having the good and lawful alignments for

beak are also treated as silvered weap-

ons  for  purposes  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

This large owl stands slightly over 9 feet tall and

has  a  mixture  of  snow-white  and  charcoal-gray

feathers. Its wicked talons, sharp beak, and wide

eyes all possess a silvery gleam.

Owl archons patrol the skies of Celestia and

other good-aligned planes. They primarily

serve as airborne scouts, messengers, and

spies  for  the  throne  archons. They  can

also  serve  as  airborne  in-

fantry  when  needed.

Beyond  their  duties  to

their  superiors,  owl

archons  also  protect

lesser  celestial  creatures

animals  in  particular.  Harm-

ing  a  celestial  creature  on  the

Upper Planes is one quick way to

earn an owl archons wrath.

Owl  archons  rarely  announce  their  pres-

ence. When they spot a potential threat, they alert their superi-

ors  before  confronting  the  threat  directly,  although  they  are

quite capable of dealing with most problems on their own. They

do not require sleep and spend most of their time in flight. They

periodically leave the skies to consort with allies on land or visit

the courts of the celestial paragons. They are expected to give

daily  reports  to  their  superiors,  apprising  them  of  possible

threats on whatever plane they happen to reside.

Owl  archons  stand  8  feet  tall  and  weigh  300  pounds. They

speak Celestial, Draconic, Infernal, and Sylvan.

Combat

Battle is not the first choice for an owl archon. However, when

negotiations fail, an owl archon takes to the air and uses its eye

rays and spell-like abilities against opponents. In numbers, owl

archons  are  quite  bold  and  often  strafe  their  enemies  with

swoop attacks.

160

Eye Rays (Su): Six times

per day, an owl archon can

shoot twin beams of silvery light

from its eyes, striking an oppo-

nent  within  120  feet.  The  owl

archon  must  succeed  on  a  ranged

touch attack to hit, and any creature

struck by the eye rays must make a DC

20  Fortitude  save  or  be  turned  to  stone.

This  abilitys  save  DC  is  Constitution-

based.

Spell-like Abilities: At willcalm ani-

mals (DC 13), charm animal (DC 13), dispel

magic, faerie fire, freedom of movement (self

only; always active), speak with animals;

3/daydismissal (DC 16), find the path

(DC  18),  greater  dispel  magic,  neutralize

poison  (DC  16);  1/daydivine  power,

reincarnate. Caster level 12th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Swoop (Ex): The owl archon can execute a

swoop attack that is similar to a charge action in

all respects, except as noted here. The owl archon

must fly toward its target for a minimum of 40 feet

in a straight line. If the swoop attack succeeds, the owl

archon can attempt to grapple the target without

provoking  an  attack  of  opportunity  or

deal double claw damage (2d8+8 points)

instead.

Aura of Menace (Su): Will save DC 17.

Stone  to  Flesh (Sp):  An  owl  archon  can  use

stone  to  flesh at  will,  as  the  spell  (Fortitude  DC  18  negates).

When cast on a creature turned to stone by the archons own eye

rays (see above), the spell does not require the target to make a

Fortitude save to survive the transformation. Caster level 12th.

Skills: An owl archons keen vision gives it a +4 racial bonus

on Spot checks. *In areas of shadowy illumination, the bonus

increases to +8.

This creature resembles a ruggedly

handsome, oversized human with

glorious,  feathered  wings.  Before

entering battle, it transforms its

forearms  into  sharp,  fiery

blades  that  ripple  the  air

around them.

The  paragons  of  the  Seven  Heavens  use

sword archons as enforcers of the heavenly

laws,  a  pursuit  to  which  the  canny  sword

archons seem perfectly suited.

:

Unless the situation requires a specific weapon, sword archons

generally prefer to use their armblades in combat. While most

sword archons revel in battle, they understand the heavy burden

of  the  magic  abilities  available  to  them.  Accordingly,  sword

archons  use  their  powerful  discorporating  dive  only  against

those enemies they know to have transgressed the laws of Mount

Celestia  or  against  the  sworn  enemies  of  lawful  good  deities.

A sword archons natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as having the good

and lawful alignments for the pur-

pose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Armblades  (Ex): As  a  free

action, a sword archon can mold

the flesh of its forearms, harden-

ing  and  sharpening  organic

matter into the form of power-

ful magic blades. The archon

wields  the  blades  like  long-

swords,  and  they  gain  the

properties  of  +2  holy  flaming

longswords.

Sword  archons  can  shift

back to their normal hands as a

free  action. The  armblades  cannot

be  disarmed  or  sundered,  and  they

automatically  assume  limb  form

upon the archons death.

Discorporating  Dive  (Su):

Three  times  per  day,  a  sword

archon  can  attempt  to  destroy  a

living enemy with a powerful dive

attack, literally flying through its

opponent armblades-first, tearing

apart its body and sending its soul

to  imprisonment  in  the  Seven

Heavens.

Resolve  a  flying  charge  as

normal.  If  the  archon  fails  to

damage  its  opponent,  the  dis-

corporating  dive  attack  is

wasted. If damaged, however, the target

must make a DC 17 Fortitude save. Those

who succeed on the Fortitude save suffer

no  further  effect  beyond  the  damage  of

the attack.

Sword archons dress in simple garments of patterned

cloth, covering themselves in great cloaks when attempt-

ing to blend in with their surroundings. Most make little

effort to conceal themselves, however, believing that the just-

ness of their mission would be compromised by subterfuge. The

beauty  of  a  sword  archons  feathered  wings  rivals  that  of  the

most  stunning  giant  eagles. When  angered  or  in  combat,  the

forearms of a sword archon shift form to take on the quality of

holy flaming longswords.

Sword archon

If  the  save  fails,  the  attack  utterly  annihilates

the  victims  body,  killing  it  instantly.  Further,  the

victims soul is bound to a great prison in the Seven

Heavens  of  Celestia,  where  it  remains  until  the

archons  that  manage  the  celestial  donjon  see  fit  to  release  it.

Release  generally  involves  bartering  with  a  throne  archon

(see  Chapter  7:  Celestial  Paragons),  with  some  quest  for  the

cause of law and goodness being the most common price. Such

agents of Heaven never release the soul of an unredeemed evil

creature.

Sword  archons  speak  Celestial  and  Infernal. They  stand  10

feet tall and weigh 550 pounds.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willaid, continual flame, divination,

locate creature, locate object, message; 3/daycommune, dispel chaos

This towering, regal figure has fair hair, flawless golden skin, and glow-

facial expression bears an unshakable countenance that suggests great

wisdom and conviction. Although this glorious being has no wings, it

wears an ornate suit of golden full plate and carries a massive great-

sword etched with runes.

The spirits of the Seven Heavens of Celestia congregate in mag-

nificent  cities  throughout  the  planes  seven  layers.  Throne

archons,  powerful  embodiments  of  law  and  good,  command

these cities with stern attention to order and unyielding dedi-

cation to the power of benevolence. They serve as the judges of

the Heavens, occasionally tasking themselves with meting out

justice to the particularly vile or corrupt. Such duties require the

utmost patience and attention, so most resent being called to

the Material Plane. Nonetheless, if bargained with carefully, a

throne archon can be a devastatingly effective ally.

Throne  archons  stand  tallest  among  their  race,  the  largest

reaching 10 feet or more. Unlike most archons, thrones bear no

wings.  However,  their  belief  in  the

causes they represent gives them the

natural  ability

to  soar

through the air. Their faces

reflect  the  human  ideal  of

beauty, though all bear a regal,

somewhat  cold  expression

that  hints  at  the  ability  to

make  difficult  decisions.

Their eyes glow with the

glorious  love  of  the

Upper Planes.

speak  Abyssal,

They stand 12

feet  tall  and  weigh  700

pounds.

Combat

Throne  archons

let

others  (particularly

sword  archons  and

owl  archons,  who  serve

them  directly)  bloody

themselves  in  the

ceaseless  battle

against evil, preferring

instead  to  lead  the  angelic  archons  by  ex-

ample,  keeping  their  focus  on  the  affairs  of

Celestia. When forced to confront their enemies,

however, thrones make fearsome foes. They prefer to wade into

combat,  dispatching  victims  of  their  penitentiary  gaze  with

their +1 vorpal greatswords. Known throughout the Outer Planes,

such weapons are considered a part of the throne that wields

them, and anyone who has stolen one soon finds himself the

target of countless attacks from the thrones allies and servants.

Any weapons a throne archon wields are treated as having the

good  and  lawful  alignments  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

Penitentiary  Gaze  (Su): Any  nonlawful  good  creature

within 30 feet of a throne archon that meets the creatures glow-

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  10:59 AM  Page 163

ing blue eyes must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 23) or

temporarily fall under its influence. Such a being becomes filled

with remorse over the distance his lifes actions have taken him

from the ideals of law or goodness (even if such distance would

ordinarily make him proud). The intensity of the remorse (and

the relevant game effect) varies depending upon the creatures

alignment. Compare the victims alignment to the chart below,

adding  any  game  effects  that  apply.  This  abilitys  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

The  victim  is  free  to  act  (even  to  attack

the  throne  archon)  while  under  the

effects of the penitentiary gaze.

The  effects  persist  each  round

until  the  victim  makes  a  suc-

cessful  Will  saving  throw.

Throne  archons  can  disable

or  enable  this  ability  as  a

free  action.  The  gaze

cannot  be  disabled

same

the

during

round  in  which  it

was  enabled  (and

vice versa).

Law/Chaos Axis

Neutral: The vic-

tim is beset by reli-

gious  visions

in

which  angelic  le-

gions berate him for

straying  from  the

true path of law and

goodness. As a result,

he becomes fatigued.

Chaotic: Blister-

ing  mental  hell-

ness,  causing  so

much  psychologi-

cal damage that the

exhausted.

Good/Evil Axis

Neutral: Pangs of self-

result  in  blood-red  psychoso-

takes 10 points of damage.

Standing as tall as an ogre, this hulking creature has white fur, a bear-

like head, and eyes like gleaming black opals. Its broad white paws end

in razor-sharp, jet-black claws. The creature is clad in fearsome full plate

engraved with faintly glowing symbols of holiness and virtue.

The  solemn  warden  archons  guard  the

gates of the Seven Heavens, standing

ever vigilant should that bastion

of  law  and  order  fall  under

siege.  Since  such  attacks

seldom occur, the wardens

have  a  secondary  task  of

observing the affairs of

the  Material  Plane

through  great  magi-

cal  scrying  pools

located  near  the

gates.

A warden archons

bearlike  head  and

gentle  nature  some-

times  lead  its  ene-

mies  to  assume  it

possesses an ursine

disposition  to  lazi-

ness,  a  conclusion

soon  proven  wrong

by  powerful  jaws

and  claws  once

combat  has  begun.

Wardens  never

sleep,  spending  all

of their time observ-

ing  their  assigned

pools or gates. Many

mortals  hence  refer

to  wardens

as

Watchers. They have

more interactions with

and  a  keener  under-

standing  of  the  mortal

world than any other archons,

a  point  of  pride  they  bear  openly

(occasionally  too  openly,  leading  to  some  chafing  among  the

other archons). Perhaps because of the temptations they view

daily,  more  warden  archons  fall  to  the  vices  of  evil  than  any

other type of celestial.

Warden archons never speak aloud, preferring to communi-

cate via telepathy. They stand 10 feet tall and weigh 650 pounds.

Combat

Most  warden  archons  abhor  battle,  but  take  to  it  with  relish

when  protecting  the  gateways  of  Celestia  from  interlopers  or

164

when tasked to carry out some important deed in the name of

the deities of good. Wardens generally use their unerring assay

ability to locate potential targets before wading into melee and

attempting to grab, constrict, and rend as many opponents as

possible. Their  powerful  muscles  and  razor-sharp  claws  make

them stunning, if reluctant, hand-to-hand fighters.

A warden archons natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as having the good and lawful alignments for

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Rend (Ex): If a warden archon hits a single target with both

claws, it latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh.

This attack deals 2d8+12 points of

damage.

Spell-Like  Abilities: At

willaid,  continual  flame,

detect  scrying,  detect  thoughts

(DC 13), locate creature, scry-

ing (DC  16),  see  invisibility,

Charisma modifier.

Scent  (Ex): A  warden

archon  can  detect  approach-

ing enemies, sniff out hidden

foes,  and  track  by  sense  of

smell.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A

warden  archon  retains  its

Dexterity bonus to AC even

when  flat-footed  and  cannot

be  flanked  except  by  a  12th-

level or higher rogue.

Asura

Unerring  Assay  (Su): A

warden  archon  instinctively

knows  the  alignment  of  any

creature  within  60  feet.  Typical

methods  of  masking  alignment,

such  as  misdirection or  nondetection,

have  no  effect  upon  a  warden  archons

unerring assay.

Skills: A warden archons keen senses give it a +8

You  are  drawn  first  to  the

the long mane of coppery-red hair that crowns its

pale head. Marble-white flesh covers the beings stately frame.

Its legs end in birdlike talons with ruby-sharp claws, and

wings of crackling flame spring from its narrow shoulders.

A noble warrior, the asura (ah-SOO-rah) is found throughout the

Upper Planes, serving deities as messengers and heralds with

righteous zealotry. Sometimes one or more asuras are sent on

missions to other planes, carrying messages of revenge, punish-

ment, and death to those who have challenged or angered one

of the powers. Other celestial beings find them impertinent and

needlessly  violent;  however,  most  asuras  take  great  pride  in

their ability to intimidate and correct evildoers.

Asuras distrust angels (especially lawful ones) and see them

as rivals for the attention of the good deities. Due to the nature

of both types of beings, neither resorts to any sort of violence,

An asura stands about 6 1/2 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.

Asuras speak Celestial.

Combat

Asuras  travel  light  and  prefer  the  scimitar  and  bow.  A  typical

asura  will  be  encountered  with  the  following  equipment:  +1

mithral breastplate, +1 buckler, +1 flaming scimitar, trumpet of doom

(described in Chapter 6: Magic), masterwork composite long-

bow (+3 Str bonus), quiver of 20 normal arrows.

An asuras natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,

are treated as having the chaotic and good alignments for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Burning Wind (Su): An asura can beat its wings as a stan-

dard action and generate a searing wave of heat

that deals 2d6 points of damage to all creatures

within a 15-foot radius.

Bariaur defender

of Ysgard

BARIAUR

The creature looks a bit

like  a  centaur,  but

itmixes  the  forms  of

human and ram rather

than  a  human  and

horse.  From  the  waist

down,  it  is  indistinguish-

able from a powerful ram. From the waist up, it looks human, except for

two curling horns emerging from the top of its forehead.

Bariaurs travel the rolling hills and woods of Ysgard, protecting

all who call that plain their home. When evil is afoot, they track

it  to  its  source,  then  charge  into  glorious  battle.  Creatures  of

wanderlust, bariaurs rarely remain in one place for long. Their

flocks follow a single leader who remains in charge as long as he

or she can defeat opponents in a clash of horns (a sequence of

charge attacks similar to a jousting competition). Bariaurs love

contests, which tend to be sources of good-natured amusement

rather than rigorous tests of fitness.

165

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  11:00 AM  Page 166

Bariaurs  revere  Ehlonna,  deity  of  the  woodlands,  and  are

strict herbivores. Only bariaur rangers tend to eat meatgen-

erally  from  woodland  creatures  theyve  hunted  themselves.

Bariaurs  stand  6  feet  tall  at  the  shoulder  and  weigh  800

pounds. They speak Celestial and Common.

Combat

Bariaurs  relish  a  good  fight,  charging  into  battle  with  their

heads  lowered.  Once  theyve  pounded  their  way  through  the

front ranks of their foes, they press the attack in melee while

other bariaur archers pepper the defenders with a hail of arrows.

Powerful  Charge  (Ex):  A  bariaur  often  begins  a  battle  by

charging at an opponent, lowering its head to smash its horns

against a foe. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of

a charge, this allows the bariaur to make a single gore attack that

deals 2d6+2 points of bludgeoning damage.

Bariaur  Traits  (Ex):  Bariaurs  benefit  from  the  following

crypt  wardens  are  protectors  of  the  resting  places  of  saints  and

heroes.

Unlike  animated  undead  that  stand  eternal  guard  over  their

haunts,  crypt  wardens  lie  inanimate  until  their  tombs  are  dis-

turbed. When intruders enter, the crypt wardens spirit returns

from its enjoyment of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia,

animating its corpse in deathless form to protect the holy ground

it guards. When the threat is over, its soul returns to its rest.

A crypt wardens basic form is indistinguishable from a skele-

ton or similar creature. It wears a fine breastplate and carries a

shield and sword to use in its tombs defense. It speaks Common

and Celestial.

Combat

Crypt  wardens  fight  fearlessly,  for  they  literally  have

nothing  to  losewin  or  lose,  their  spirit  returns  to

heavenly bliss when its task is done. They are far more

intelligent than they appear, and quickly surprise tomb-

robbers who assume them to be nothing more than

mindless skeletons.

Animate  Objects  (Su): As  a  stan-

dard  action,  a  crypt  warden  can

cause a statue or another object

within the tomb it guards to

animate, as if affected by the

animate  objects spell.  It  can

animate  one  object  of

Large size or smaller each

round;  this  ability

otherwise  works  as  the

spell cast by a 10th-level cleric.

Coure

Holy Smite (Sp): A crypt guardian can use holy smite

at  will.  Caster  level  10th;  Will  save  DC  17.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Deathless Traits: A crypt warden is immune to mind-affect-

ing  effects,  poison,  sleep,  paralysis,  stunning,  disease,  death

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save, except for

energy  drain  attacks,  effects  that  also  work  on  objects,  and

harmless  effects.  It  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal

damage, ability drain, or death from massive damage. It is not

subject to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution damage. A crypt

warden  cannot  be  raised  or resurrected.  A  crypt  warden  has

darkvision (60-foot range).

ELADRIN

Eladrins are chaotic good celestials, distant cousins to the neu-

tral good guardinals and lawful good archons. The ranks of the

eladrins include the bralani and ghaele, which are described in

the Monster Manual. Rules for making a ghaele character are also

presented in Savage Species.

Like all celestials, eladrins are advocates of good throughout

the planes and staunch enemies of fiends. Their favorite causes

include opposition to organized evil and tyrannical regimes, as

well as combating the influence of devils.

Eladrins are no less beautiful than other celestials, but have a

fey,  somewhat  wild  look  in  comparison,  for  example,  to  the

stately beauty of the archons.

Combat

Of  all  celestials,  eladrins  might  be  the  most  ready  to  enter

combat, for their ire is easily provoked whenever

they  witness  injustice  or  oppression.  Their

chaotic  bent  also  makes  them  somewhat

unpredictable,  though  they  can  at  least  be

relied  upon  to  avoid  any  evil  act.  Unlike

archons,  however,  they  are  not  preoccupied

with  avoiding  even  the  appear-

ance of evil.

Immunities:  Eladrins  are

immune to electricity and petrifi-

cation.

Energy Resistance  (Ex):  Eladrins

have  resistance  to  acid  10  and  cold  10.

Tongues (Su): Eladrins can speak

with any creature that has a lan-

guage, as though using a tongues

spell  cast  by  a  14th-level  cleric.

This  ability  is  always  active.

a free action that the coure can perform once per round.

FIRRE

The smallest of the eladrins, the spritelike coures

embody carefree wandering, celebrating life as a

joyous dance. They often serve more powerful

beings  as  messengers  and  scouts,  provided

those  they  serve  can  tolerate  their  erratic

humor  and  near  endless  pranks.  Coures

exist  to  laugh.  They  prefer  a  star-filled

night  in  the  open  to  any  other  time  or

place,  preferring  to  reveal  their  pranks

and dance only in their own faerie light.

Coure  eladrins  appear  in  a  variety  of

improbable colors and are fond of wear-

ing bright apparel of questionable taste.

A coure can also assume the shape of an

incorporeal ball of light at will.

Coures  stand  2  feet  tall  and  weigh  20

pounds.  They  speak  Celestial  and

Common.

Combat

Coures  avoid  physical  combat,  knowing  that

their  small  frames  and  tiny  weapons  are  no

match for many larger foes. Unless directly con-

fronting  minor  evil  outsiders  such  as  imps,

coures see combat as a prompt to seek out and

befriend larger and more powerful celestials.

Any weapons a coure wields are treated as

having the chaotic and good alignments for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdancing lights, detect

evil,  detect  magic,  faerie  fire; 3/daymagic  missile,  sleep

Alternate  Form  (Su): A  coure  can  assume  the  form  of  an

incorporeal ball of light at will. This transformation counts as a

standard action. In this form, the coure can be harmed only by

other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, spells,

spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. In this form, the

coure has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal

source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch

weapons. A coure in this form can pass through solid objects,

but  not  force  effects,  at  will.  While  incorporeal,  its  attacks

ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses

and force effects work normally against them. In this form, a

The firre (pronounced FEER) eladrins love nothing more than an

evening  spent  dancing  and  singing  around  the  campfire,  but

such  frivolity  masks  their  serious  purpose  as  guardians  of

artistry and beauty. Devotees of all things precious and lovely,

firres take up arms to protect works of art and the artists that

create them. Theyre the mostly widely traveled of the eladrins,

going far and wide to hear a noted bard, gaze at a particular daz-

zling sunset, or witness a finely acting drama.

Firres can also transform themselves at will into crackling, 8-

foot-tall pillars of fire.

A firre stands about 6 feet tall and weighs

150 pounds. Firres speak Celestial, Com-

mon, Draconic, and Infernal.

Shiradi

Combat

Firres  seek  to  disrupt  a

battle  with  their  wide

array of spells and spell-

like  abilities  before  a

fight  can  begin  in

earnest.  When  pos-

sible,  they  protect

any  innocents  and

precious items in the

vicinity  from  harm

before  turning  their

attention  to  the  ene-

my.  When  they  do

fight,  they  maneuver  as

pillars  of  fire,  then  trans-

form  into  humanoid  form

to  use  their  gaze  and  spell

attacks,  and  finally  wade  into

combat with their +3 greatswords

or throw their +5 javelins (most firres

carry four).

A  firres  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any

weapons it wields, are treated as having the

chaotic and good alignments for the pur-

pose  of  overcoming  damage  reduction.

Gaze (Su): In humanoid form, the firre

can  gaze  at  a  target  within  60  feet  and

cause  it  to  burst  into  flames.  The  gaze

deals  2d6  points  of  fire  damage  and  causes  blindness  (as  the

blindness/deafness spell).  A  successful  DC  18  Fortitude  save

negates the blindness. The DC is Charisma-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect thoughts (DC 16), fireball

(DC 17), greater invisibility, persistent image (DC 19), polymorph, see

invisibility,  wall  of  fire; 1/dayprismatic  spray (DC  21).  Caster

level 10th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Spells: A firre in humanoid form casts divine spells from the

cleric list and the Chaos, Fire, Good, and Magic domains as a

12th-level cleric.

Typical Spells Prepared (6/6+1/5+1/5+1/3+1/3+1/2+1; save DC

13 + spell level): 0detect magic, detect poison, guidance, mending,

read magic, resistance; 1stbless, detect evil, divine favor, sanctuary,

ray  of  hope,  shield  of  faith;  2ndalign  weapon,  bears  endurance,

eagles splendor, hold person, resist energy; 3rdcontinual flame, dispel

magic,  invisibility  purge,  prayer,  searing  light;  4thdimensional

170

anchor, dismissal, tongues; 5thbreak enchantment, dispel evil, flame

strike; 6thgreater dispel magic, heal.

Alternate Form (Su): A firre can shift between its humanoid

and  fiery  forms  as  a  standard  action.  In  humanoid  form,  it

cannot fly or use its fiery slam attacks, but it can use its haze

attack  and  spell-like  abilities,  make  weapon  attacks,  sing,  and

cast spells. In the form of a pillar of fire, it can fly, make slam

attacks, and use spell-like abilities, but cannot sing, cast spells,

or use its gaze attack.

A firre remains in one form until it chooses to take the other

form. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor

does  a  firre  revert  to  any  particular  form

when killed. A true seeing spell reveals

both  forms  simultaneously.

Magic  Circle  against

Evil  (Su):  A  magic  circle

against  evil  effect  al-

ways  surrounds  firres,

as the spell cast by an

8th-level  sorcerer.

(The  defensive  bene-

fits  of  the  circle  are

not  included  in  the

statistics above.)

Song (Su): A firre

has  a  captivating

voice  and  can  use

bardic  music  just  as

a  bard  can,  inspiring

courage, fascinating, in-

spiring  competence,  or

giving  suggestions  to  those

who hear it (see Bardic Music

in Chapter 3 of the Players Hand-

book). Unlike a bard, however, a firre

can sing as often as it likes.

Standing 11 feet tall, this heavily muscled, statuesque figure has gleam-

ing bronze skin, wild black hair that seemingly moves of its own accord,

pointed ears with serrated lobes, and piercing black eyes. Its features are

bold  and  striking,  and  its  twin  bronze  wings  shine  brightly  even  in

faint light. In its hands, it clutches a great spiked chain.

Shiradis  battle  for  freedom  across  the  planes,  helping  the

oppressed,  deceived,  and  less  fortunate  wherever  they  travel.

They are in some ways the most morally flexible of all celestials,

believing that all creatures are free to act as they see fit as long as

their actions do not in turn impinge on the freedoms of others.

Although they often act on impulse, shiradis fight tirelessly

on the side of good, seeking out those conflicts and areas where

good creatures cannot act or think freely.

A shiradi exhibits none of the elflike frailty of other eladrins.

In  addition  to  its  statuesque  humanoid  form,  it  can  take  the

form of a swirling cloud of golden, triangular shards of light.

Shiradis  weigh  400  pounds  and  speak  Celestial,  Common,

Draconic, and Infernal.

Combat

Shiradi  eladrins  do  not  lightly  engage  in  combat,  but  when

moved to strike against injustice, they attack with unflinching

courage and devotion. In the first few rounds of combat, shi-

radis try to keep their foes within the usually superior reach of

their mighty spiked chains while casting beneficial spells such

as divine favor and bless weapon. In this manner, they try to take

advantage  of  their  reach  and  multiple  attacks  of  opportunity.

Their creative and individualistic nature makes shiradis inven-

tive tacticians, and they use their abilities to surprise foes when-

ever possible.

Any  weapons  a  shiradi  eladrin  wields  are  treated  as  having

the chaotic and good alignments for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Lightshard Strike (Su): A shiradi that assumes the form of a

cloud  of  light  shards  can  slam  an  opponent  for  2d6  points  of

damage. The slam is treated as a ghost touch attack for purposes

of  hitting  incorporeal  creatures.  In  addition,  the  light  shards

also act as a greater dispel magic spell targeted upon the creature

(caster level 12th).

Spell-Like  Abilities: At  willaid,  bless,  bless  weapon,  detect

poison, detect undead, greater dispel magic, divine favor, remove curse

(DC 19), remove fear (DC 17), remove paralysis (DC 18); 3/day

break  enchantment,  holy  smite (DC  20),  restoration (DC  20);

1/daycloak of chaos (DC 24), heal (DC 22). Caster level 12th.

The  save  DCs  are  Charisma-based. Shiradis  gain  a  +10  sacred

bonus on caster level checks made to dispel Enchantment spells

or effects when using greater dispel magic or break enchantment.

The following spell-like abilities are always active on the shi-

radi: blessed sight*, discern lies (DC 20), and see invisibility. Caster

level 14th.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Alternate  Form  (Su): A  shiradi  can  shift  between  its

humanoid  and  cloud  of  light  shards  forms  as  a  standard

action. In humanoid form, it cannot use its slam attack, but it

can fly and use its spell-like abilities and its weapons. In cloud

form, it can fly, make slam attacks, and use spell-like abilities,

but it cannot use its weapons.

A shiradi remains in one form until it chooses to assume a

new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the

shiradi revert to any particular form when killed. A true seeing

spell, however, reveals both forms simultaneously.

Enchantment Awareness (Su): Shiradis are automatically

aware of Enchantment effects affecting creatures within 20 feet.

Protective Aura (Su): As a free action, a shiradi can surround

itself with a nimbus of light having a radius of 20 feet. This acts

as a double-strength magic circle against evil and as a lesser globe of

invulnerability, both as cast by a cleric whose level equal to the

shiradis Hit Dice.

Skills: Shiradis  get  a  +10  racial  bonus  on  Sense  Motive

checks.

The being resembles a tall, stately elven noble dressed in shimmering

robes of shifting color. It has pure, yellow-gold skin and bright purple

eyes.

The tulanis, the ancient faerie lords of the eladrin, roam seeking

peace,  beauty,  and  solitude.  These  great  beings  favor  peace,

though  the  plights  of  good  creatures  can  move  them  to  fight

evil.  When  stirred  to  battle,  the  beautiful  tulanis  can  shatter

entire armies of evil, wielding glowing swords of light and cas-

cades of lightning.

Tulanis  exude  unearthly  beauty  and  grace;  their  voices  are

living music, and their faces shine with purity and beauty. The

most  reclusive  of  the  eladrins,  tulanis  rarely  stray  from  the

forests of the outer planes unless in answer to a dire summons.

The tulanis, and through them all eladrins, answer to the Queen

of Stars, the greatest of their kind.

Tulanis  speak  Auran,  Celestial,  Common,  Draconic,  Elven,

Infernal,  and  Sylvan.  They  stand  6  feet  tall  and  weigh  150

pounds.

Combat

Inventive tacticians and powerful spellcasters, the tulanis react

well  in  both  large  engagements  and  small  skirmishes.  The

reclusive tulanis are often underestimated by their foes. They

use dispel magic to strip protections away from mortal foes, then

shower them in repeated castings of their powerful chain light-

ning. Against fiends and other creatures resistant to lightning,

the tulanis fight mobile battles combining their spell-like abili-

ties and use of the Spring Attack feat.

A tulanis natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,

are treated as having the chaotic and good alignments for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A tulanis alternate form is that of a 4-foot-radius scintillating

sphere of rainbow-hued light.

Dream Ray (Su): In globe form, a tulani can fire a coruscat-

ing ray of light with a range of 300 feet. The ray deals 1d6 points

of  temporary  Charisma  damage  with  a  successful  hit.  Any

nonevil creature reduced to 0 Charisma by the dream ray falls

into  a  dream-filled  coma.  An  evil  creature  reduced  to  0

Charisma falls into a nightmare-wracked coma and takes 1d10

points of damage plus an additional 1d10 points of damage per

hour spent in the comatose state. A creature awakens from its

coma  if  its  Charisma  is  raised  to  1  or  higher. This  is  a  mind-

affecting effect.

Gaze (Su): Slay evil creatures of 5 HD or fewer, range 60 feet,

Will DC 27 negates. The DC is Charisma-based.

The  following  abilities  are  always  active  on  the  tulanis

person, as the spells cast by an 18th-level sorcerer: blessed sight*,

detect law, detect magic, magic circle against evil (20-foot radius), and

true seeing. These abilities may be dispelled, but the tulani can

reactivate them as a free action.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Sword of Light (Su): A tulani can create a +4 brilliant energy

holy longsword at will as a free action. If the tulani dies or loses

physical contact with the sword, the sword disappears instantly.

Alternate Form (Su): A tulani can shift between its humanoid

and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot

fly or use its dream rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like

abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it

can fly, use its dream rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot

cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is incorporeal,

and  a  tulani  has  no  Strength  score  while  in  that  form.  While

incorporeal,  a  tulani  can  be  harmed  only  by  other  incorporeal

creatures, +1 or better magic weapons (though its damage reduc-

tion still applies as well), and spells, spell-like abilities, or super-

natural  abilities.  It  is  immune  to  all  nonmagical  attack  forms.

Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to

ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive

energy,  negative  energy,  force  effects,  such  as  magic  missile,  or

attacks made with ghost touch weapons).

A tulani remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new

one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the tulani

revert  to  any  particular  form  when  killed.  A  true  seeing  spell,

however, reveals both forms simultaneously.

Bardic Music: Tulanis use the bardic music ability as 18th-

level bards. Tulanis can use or maintain concentration on one

such ability per round as a free action, requiring no instrument

other than their unearthly voices.

Protective Aura (Su): As a free action, a tulani can surround

itself with a nimbus of light having a radius of 20 feet. This acts

as a double-strength magic circle against evil and as a lesser globe of

invulnerability, both as cast by a cleric whose level equal to the

tulanis Hit Dice.

GUARDINAL

Guardinals  are  the  native  outsiders  of  Elysium,  the  living

embodiment of goodness. Guardinals are one of seven varieties:

the  avoral  and  leonal  described  in  the  Monster  Manual, the

cervidal and lupinal detailed in the Monster Manual II, and the

varieties  described  here:  the  lowly  musteval,  the  equinal,  and

the mighty ursinal.

The guardinals are staunch opponents of evil wherever it is

found. Left untroubled on their home plane, guardinals are as

peaceful as Elysium itself, roaming its magnificent landscapes

in small bands of companions. When evil threatens their home,

however, the guardinals are as fierce as any archon, and numer-

ous guardinals leave Elysium on righteous crusades to fight evil

on the Material Plane or other realms.

Guardinals  combine  the  features  of  handsome,  noble

humans  and  equally  noble  animals.  Individuals  vary  in  the

degree  to  which  the  animal  features  dominatesome  cervi-

dals,  for  example,  look  like  satyrs,  while  others  seem  almost

human except for the curling horns on their heads. Guardinals

who  dwell  on  the  Beastlands  are  the  most  animalistic,  often

moving about on all fours (which most other guardinals con-

sider undignified).

Combat

Guardinals vary widely in their combat ability, from the small

and weak mustevals to the mighty leonals. Ursinals are the

real spellcasters of the guardinals, while lupinals value

stealth and ambush. All guardinals prefer to subdue

and incapacitate if necessary, but they readily kill

evil  outsiders,  and  other  evil  creatures  if

necessary.

Energy  Resistance  (Ex): Guardi-

nals  have  resistance  to  acid  10  and

cold 10.

Immunities: Guardinals

are  immune  to  electricity

and petrification. They have

a  +4  racial  bonus  on  saves

against poison.

Speak  with  Animals (Sp):

Guardinals  can  mentally

communicate with animals as

a  free  action.  This  works

exactly like speak with animals as

cast  by  an  8th-level  druid  but

does not require sound.

Tongues (Su): Guardinals can

speak  with  any  creature  that  has  a

language,  as  though  using  a  tongues

spell  cast  by  a  14th-level  cleric.  This

ability is always active.

Level Adjustment: +7

This creature resembles a human with some

of the qualities of a draft horse. Its chest and

shoulders are of heroic proportion, and

its long arms end in thick, iron-hard

fingers that make a creditable hoof

when curled into a fist. Its legs are

even more horselike, with a long foot

ending  in  a  true  hoof.  Its  lower  limbs

are covered with short, bristly hair, and its face is

long  and  narrow,  with  a  long,  wild  mane

running from the crest of its head down to

the center of its back.

Along  with  cervidals,  equinals  are

the most common guardinals. They

are strong, boisterous, and generally

good-natured  champions  of

good.

Equinals stand just shy

of  8  feet  tall,  but  their

chests  are  like  barrels  and

they  weigh  600  pounds  or

more.  They  speak  Celestial  and

Equinal

Common.

Combat

In combat, equinals disdain the

use  of  weapons  and  wade  into

melee  with  their  iron-hard  fists.

They embrace any reasonable

opportunity to stand hoof-to-

toe  with  evil  creatures  and

beat  them  senseless. They  never

back  down  from  a  fight,  even  when  obviously  outmatched.

An  equinals  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any  weapons  it

wields, are treated as having the good alignment for the purpose

of overcoming damage reduction.

Spell-Like  Abilities: At  willaid (DC  14),  command (DC

fog cloud, light, magic circle against evil (self only), magic missile,

and see invisibility; 1/dayslow (DC  15)  and wall of stone (DC

17). Caster level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Whinny (Su): Once per hour, as a free action, an equinal can

emit a piercing shriek that affects all nonguardinals in a 20-foot

spread. Creatures with 4 HD or fewer are stunned for 1d6

rounds, while creatures with more than 4 HD are deaf-

ened for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 16 Fortitude

save negates either effect. This is a sonic effect.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Although the least powerful of the guardinals, mustevals never-

theless are unstinting foes against evil. They serve greater celes-

tials as spies, and they often aid humanoid heroes by delivering

information  about  powerful  evil  creatures. They  are  the  only

guardinal variety not represented among the Five Compan-

ions  of Talisid,  the  Celestial  Lion,  and  harbor  some

resentment over that fact, which they regard as a

simple oversight bound to be corrected very

soon.

This  large  biped  has  distinctive  bearlike

attributes. Its body is covered with fur that varies in color from light

gold to red to golden-brown. The hair grows thick and long on its fore-

arms, back, and lower legs but thin and fine on its torso and face. Its

face, which has a pronounced muzzle and high-set ears, bears a kind

expression.

Ursinal

Ursinals  are  the  scholars  and  philosophers  of  the  guardinals,

benevolent and wise. They serve as advisors to the leonals and

record-keepers of Elysium. They enjoy sharing their knowledge,

often at great length with endless digressions.

Ursinals  stand  just  over  8  feet  tall  and  weigh  close  to  700

pounds. They speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic, and

Infernal.

Ursinals  dislike  combat  and  avoid  physical  confrontations  as

long as possible. They are as fierce once they enter melee as any

dire bear, but they prefer to use their spell ability to break off

combat before it gets started.

An  ursinals  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any  weapons  it

wields, are treated as having the good alignment for the purpose

of overcoming damage reduction.

Improved Grab (Ex): If an ursinal hits an opponent that is

at  least  one  size  category  smaller  than  itself  with  a  claw

attack, it deals normal lethal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. Thereafter, the ursinal has the option

to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

one claw to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but the ursinal is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each success-

ful  grapple  check  it  makes  during

successive  rounds  automatically  deals

claw damage.

Spells: An  ursinal  casts  spells  as  a

12th-level wizard. They favor Divination

and  Enchantment  spells,  as  well  as  those

that mislead or confuse opponents rather

than deal damage.

Typical  Spells  Prepared  (4/5/5/5/4/3/2;

save DC 14 + spell level; Enchantment save

DC  15  +  spell  level):  0daze,  detect  poison,

flare, light; 1stcharm person, color spray, eyes

New spell described in Chapter 6 of

this book.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willaid, day-

light,  deep  slumber  (DC  17), detect  evil,  detect

Lay on Hands (Su): This works just like the paladins ability,

but  the  ursinal  can  heal  as  much  damage  per  day  as  its  own

undamaged hit point total.

Speak with Animals (Sp): Equinals can mentally communi-

cate with animals as a free action. This works exactly like speak

with animals as cast by an 8th-level druid but does not require

sound.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): While on Elysium, ursinals can react

to danger before their senses would normally allow them to do

so.  They  retain  their  Dexterity  bonuses  to  Armor  Class  even

when caught flat-footed. They lose this ability on other planes.

Hollyphant

This creature looks like a small, golden-furred

elephant about 2 feet long, with a pair of

shining white wings sprouting from its

back.  Its  coat  shimmers  and  gleams,

and its eyes dance with a rainbow of

colors.

The  hollyphants  larger  form

can  be  described  as  follows:

Immense  leathery  wings  sprout

from  the  broad  shoulders  of  this

bipedal  mastodon.  It  has  bright

eyes,  shaggy  black  fur  covering

most  of  its  great  bulk,  and  curved

tusks like gleaming scimitars.

176

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  11:04 AM  Page 177

Hollyphants are servants of the powers of good, found through-

out  the  Upper  Planes  on  missions  for  such  exalted  deities  as

Chaav and Lastai. They act as messengers and helpers for any

good deity, carry messages to mortals, and help celestial agents

in  their  tasks.  Their  harmless,  even  comical  appearance  has

proven the downfall of many evil creatures that grossly under-

estimate their significant magical and psionic power.

A hollyphant has two formsa Large bipedal mammoth with

curved  tusks  and  a  small  golden-furred  elephant.  In  its  Large

form, the hollyphant stands 12 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.

In  its  Small  form,  the  hollyphant  measures  2  feet  long  and

weighs  60  pounds.  A  hollyphant  communicates  telepathically.

Combat

Hollyphants  make  fre-

quent use of their

blessed  sight to

discern  evil

creatures  and

either  harass

them,  attack

them  itself,

or alert more

p o w e r f u l

c e l e s t i a l s

to  their  lo-

cation.  They

avoid  physical

confrontation

because of their

small  size,  but

have a wide range

of  spell-like,  su-

pernatural, and psi-

onic  abilities

to

defend  themselves.

Psionics  (Sp): At

sight*,

willblessed

detect  chaos,  detect  law,

detect  poison,  detect

thoughts (DC 15), invisibil-

ity, know direction, see invisi-

bility,  and suggestion  (DC  16).

These  effects  are  as  the  spells

cast  by  a  6th-level  sorcerer  (save

DCs, where applicable, are 13 + spell level).

The save DCs for these abilities are based on Charisma.

Three-headed

leskylor

sonic  damage  and  be  stunned  for  2  rounds.  Creatures  that

make a successful save take 1d10 points of sonic damage and

are stunned for 1 round. This DC is Constitution-based.

A 30-foot cone-shaped burst of sun sparkles. These motes of

holy  power  deal  8d8  points  of  damage  to  evil  outsiders,

undead, and any other creature vulnerable to holy water. A

successful DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half.

This DC is Charisma-based.

Alternate  Form  (Su):  A  hollyphant  can  shift  between  its

Small  and  Large  forms  as  a  standard  action.  In  Large  form,  it

loses the benefits of its invulnerability ability (see below) but

gains the advantages of its new size and strength.

A hollyphant remains in one form until it chooses to assume

the  other  form.  A  change  in  form  cannot  be

dispelled,  nor  does  the

hollyphant  revert

to any particular

form  when

killed. A true

seeing spell,

h o w e v e r ,

reveals both

forms  simul-

taneously.

Invulnerabili-

ty  (Su): A  Small

hollyphants  shim-

mering  coat  pro-

tects  it  as  a  continu-

ous  globe  of  invulnera-

bility, but only the hol-

lyphant  is  warded.  In

Large  form,  the  holly-

phant loses this ability.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At

willbless, light, greater teleport

(self  and  up  to  20  pounds  of

objects only); 3/daycure moderate

wounds (DC  15), protection  from  evil;

1/daybanishment (DC 19), flame strike

(DC  18), heal (DC  19), raise  dead.  Caster

level  15th.  The  save  DCs  are  Charisma-

based.

Telepathy (Su): A hollyphant can commu-

nicate telepathically with any creature within 60

feet that has a language.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Summon  Celestial (Sp): Once  per  day,  a  hollyphant  can

attempt to summon another hollyphant, an asura, or an avoral

guardinal with a 45% chance of success. The summoned crea-

ture automatically returns whence it came after 1 hour. A hol-

lyphant  that  has  just  been  summoned  cannot  use  its  own

summon ability for 1 hour.

Trumpet (Su): Three times per day, a hollyphant can issue a

blast of sound through its trunk, choosing one of the following

effects each time:

A 60-foot cone-shaped burst of sound forces creatures in its

area to make a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of

LESKYLOR

This great tigerlike feline has snowy-white fur with bands of pale blue,

icy-blue eyes that flicker with intelligence, and white-feathered wings.

Its pearly white claws and teeth are long and razor-sharp.

Leskylors are intelligent creatures native to Eronia, the second

layer  of  Elysium,  which  is  characterized  by  sharp-toothed

mountains, great windstorms, and extreme weather conditions.

Leskylors generally hibernate in cool caves during the hot sum-

mers and emerge to hunt and ply the winds in the bitter-cold

winters.  They  protect  mountainous  regions  and  forests  from

evil. Though solitary by nature, they sometimes ally themselves

with crusaders for good, often agreeing to serve as mounts or

companions.

Leskylors  are  nearly  10  feet  long,  have  a  30-foot  wingspan,

and weigh 700 pounds. They speak their own language as well as

Celestial and Draconic.

Combat

When it spots an evil creature in its protected domain, the lesky-

lor  takes  to  the  air,  often  hiding  within  the  clouds  until  an

opportune moment to strike presents itself. Unless the intruder

is already known to it, the leskylor usually makes a single warn-

ing pass indicating its intention to rid the area of its presence. If

the  creature  makes  no  effort  to  leave  the  area  or  stands  its

ground, the leskylor swoops in for the kill. The leskylor uses its

frost breath first, then strikes with its claws and bite.

Frost Breath (Su): Cone-shaped burst of frost, 30 feet long,

three times per day; damage 3d6; Reflex half DC 16.

Pounce (Ex): If a leskylor charges a foe, it can make a full

attack, including two rake attacks.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +11 melee, damage 1d8+3.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayblessed sight*, cause fear (DC 12),

cure moderate wounds (DC 13), eyes of the avoral, hold person (DC

13), obscuring  mist,  vision  of  heaven*. Caster  level  6th. The  save

DCs are Wisdom-based.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the leskylor must hit

with a claw or bite attack. If it wins the grapple check, it estab-

lishes a hold and can rake.

Three-Headed Leskylor

This  creature  has  the  multiheaded  creature  template,  as  pre-

sented in Savage Species.

Frost Breath (Su): The extra heads have breath weapons (3d6

damage; Reflex save DC 17). All three breath weapons activate

on the same round but can aim in different directions.

Multiple  Heads: Having  multiple  heads  also  makes  the

leskylor  more  able  to  survive  otherwise  lethal  attacks;  for

example, a vorpal sword would have to remove all three heads to

have its usual effect. Severing a head requires hitting the crea-

tures  neck  (same  AC  as  the  leskylor)  with  a  slashing  weapon

and  dealing  damage  equal  to  the  leskylors  original  hit  point

total divided by 3 (the original number of heads). The attacker

must declare an attack against the neck before making the roll.

The severed head dies, and a natural reflex seals the neck shut to

prevent blood loss. The leskylor can no longer attack with the

severed  head  but  takes  no  other  penalties.  A  severed  head

cannot regrow naturally.

Bonus  Feats:  The  three-headed  leskylor  gains  the  bonus

feats  Multiattack  and  Improved  Multiattack  from  the  multi-

headed creature template. The Improved Multiattack feat, intro-

duced in Savage Species, removes the penalty on attack rolls for

secondary attacks made with natural weapons.

This man-sized mastiff strongly resembles a wolf hound with a shaggy,

deep-black  coat.  It  bears  some  striking  humanlike  characteristics,

including front paws with opposable digits. Its haunting eyes resemble

lustrous obsidian orbs.

Often  confused  with  the  baleful  yeth  hound,  the  moon  dog

might be considered that creatures good

counterparta  native  of  Elysium  and

champion of good. A moon dog is roughly

the size of a large man on all fours. Its front

paws have some limited capacity

for  manipulation,  and  a  moon

dog can stand and even walk (at

half speed) on its hind legs in order

to make use of the forepaws.

Moon dogs speak Celestial, Common, and

Infernal,  but  they  prefer  to  communicate

telepathically.

Combat

Moon dogs are potent fight-

ers  and  relentless  in  their

pursuit  of  evil.  They  use

their  howl  ability  as  soon

as evil foes are within range,

then use their vicious bite in

melee.

Bark  (Su): When  a  moon  dog

barks, as a standard action, it cre-

ates a dispel evil effect as cast by

a 12th-level cleric. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Bay (Su): A moon dog

can bay as a standard

action.  Its  baying

has  the  effect  of  a

fear spell cast by a 12th-level sorcerer (Will save DC 17), but it

affects only evil creatures within an 80-foot radius of the moon

dog. A creature that makes a successful Will save is immune to

that particular moon dogs baying for 24 hours. This is a sonic,

mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Howl (Su): When a moon dog howls, evil creatures within 40

feet of the moon dog take 1d4+4 points of damage per round, in

addition  to  the  fear  effect  of  its  baying.  Evil  extraplanar  crea-

tures within 40 feet of a howling moon dog are targeted by a dis-

missal effect as cast by a 12th-level caster. If more than one moon

dog is howling within 40 feet of such a creature, the creature

receives only one saving throw, and the effective caster level of

179

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  11:05 AM  Page 180

the dismissal effect is increased by +2 for each additional moon

dog beyond the first.

Soothing Ministrations (Su): By licking a wound, a moon

dog can create any of the following effects, one time each per

individual  per  day:  cure  light  wounds,  remove  disease, and  slow

poison. The moon dogs caster level is 12th.

Spell-Like Abilities: Always activearcane sight, blessed sight*,

Caster level 12th.The save DCs are Charisma-based.

New spell described in Chapter 6 of

this book.

Whine  (Su): A  moon  dog  can

whine as a standard action to automat-

ically  dispel  any  illusion  effect

within 50 feet.

Improved  Evasion  (Ex):

When subjected to an attack that

normally  allows  a  Reflex

saving throw for half damage,

a moon dog takes no damage

if  it  makes  a  successful  saving

throw  and  half  damage  if

the saving throw fails.

Keen Senses (Ex): A moon

dog sees four times as well as a

human  in  low-light  condi-

tions  and  twice  as  well  in

normal  light.  It  also  has  dark-

vision with a range of 60 feet.

Luck (Su): A moon dog

receives a +2 luck bonus on all

saving throws (reflected in the

statistics above).

Quesar

Scent (Ex): A moon dog can detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden

foes, and track by sense of smell.

Shadow  Pattern  (Su): When  in  shadowy

light, a moon dog can move itself and manipu-

late the shadows around itself to create a special shadow pat-

tern. Creating the pattern is a full-round action, and the pattern

lasts only as long as the moon dog concentrates to maintain it,

plus an additional 2 rounds. The pattern emanates in a 50-foot

radius around the moon dog. Evil creatures within this effect

are fascinated as though by a hypnotic pattern spell (Will save DC

17)  cast  by  a  10th-level  sorcerer.  Good  creatures  within  the

effect are warded by a protection from evil effect and a remove fear

effect for the duration of the pattern. The save DC for the hyp-

notic pattern effect is Charisma-based.

Speak with Canines (Sp): A moon dog can use speak with ani-

mals (as  cast  by  a  12th-level  druid)  to  communicate  with  any

canine animal, including dogs and wolves. This ability functions

at will.

Telepathy (Su): A moon dog can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 50 feet that has a language.

Skills: A moon dog receives a +4 racial bonus on Hide and

Move Silently checks.

This  gaunt  humanoid  creature  has  blue  skin  and

tall  white  hair.  A  slender  torso  joins  two  graceful

arms, powerful legs, and a noble head. This form is

obscured,  however,  by  the  incredible  amounts  of

radiant energy emanating from the creature.

Like  a  star  brought  to  ground,  a  quesar  shines  with

blinding light that sears through evil creatures. Quesars

are constructs crafted by angels, originally intended to serve as

guardians  over  celestial  treasures.  In  their  benevolence,  the

angels gave their creations minds and free will, and the quesars

refused to serve as slaves. Now they are independentan iso-

lated society of artificial life who still serve as mighty allies to

the forces of good.

Quesars stand 6 feet tall and weight 160 pounds. They speak

Celestial.

Combat

A quesars most dangerous weapon is the energy that suffuses its

frame.  Though  they  never  use  weapons,  quesars  can  disrupt

flesh and bone with a simple touch, and their energy halo is a

powerful manifestation of their terrifying might.

Blinding Radiance (Su): At will, a quesar can increase the

brightness of its energy halo so that it radiates brilliant light to

a radius of 120 feet (and shadowy illumination to 240 feet). Any

creature within this radius must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or

be  blinded  for  1d10  rounds. The  save  DC  is  Charisma-based.

Creatures with light sensitivity take double the normal penal-

ties in this brilliant light.

Consuming Brilliance (Su): Three times per day, a quesar

can create an instantaneous burst of energy so intense that it

reduces all creatures and objects within 15 feet to a trace of fine

dust, dealing 22d6 points of damage, as the disintegrate spell. A

successful DC 14 Fortitude save means the creature resists dis-

integration, instead taking 5d6 points of damage. The save DC is

based on Charisma.

Mechanus. The rheks were helped to restore order in the wake

of this cataclysmic event.

Rheks strive for harmony and perfection. They try to impose

order upon a chaotic multiverse, doing their best to crush evil

wherever they find it. They are meticulous in seeing that every-

thing is kept in its proper place, and they have a low tolerance

for unpredictable beings. They enforce order through violence,

but they are not bloodthirsty.

Rheks  stand  7  feet  tall  and  weigh  350

pounds.  They  speak  Common  and  their

own language.

Searing  Burst  (Su): After  a  quesar  has  had  blinding

radiance  active  for  at  least  1  round,  it  can  increase  its

intensity still more, creating an instantaneous burst of

searing energy similar in effect to a sunburst spell.

All creatures within 30 feet of the quesar take

6d6 points of damage (Reflex save DC 14 for

half ).  A  quesar  can  use  a  searing  burst  6

times  per  day.  The  save  DC  is  based  on

Charisma.

Construct Traits: A quesar has

immunity  to  poison,

magic  sleep  effects,

paralysis,  stunning,

disease, death effects,

necromancy  effects,

mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,  phan-

tasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects

or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual

damage,  ability  damage,  ability  drain,  fatigue,  exhaus-

tion, or energy drain. Cannot heal damage, but can be

repaired. Darkvision 60 ft. and low-light vision.

Energy  Halo  (Su): At  all  times,  a  quesar  is  sur-

rounded by a radiant glow that sheds bright light to

a radius of 20 feet and shadowy illumination to 40

feet.

Fast  Healing  (Ex):  A  quesar  regains  lost  hit

points  at  the  rate  of  5  per  round  as  long  as  it  is  in

daylight (including spells such as daylight and celestial

brilliance, but not its own energy halo). It continues re-

gaining  hit  points  even  when  destroyed,  as  long  as  it  re-

mains in daylight. Fast healing does not allow the quesar

to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

their  Power  Attack  and  Re-

Powerful  Charge  (Ex): A

rhek typically begins a battle by

charging  at  an  opponent,  lower-

ing  its  head  to  bring  its  mighty

horn  into  play.  In  addition  to  the

normal  benefits  and  hazards  of  a

charge, this allows the rhek to make

a single gore attack that deals double

damage (2d8+8 points).

nal  organs  and  rapidly  congealing  blood. They  auto-

RHEK

This hulking humanoid combines the features of a human and a rhi-

noceros. Gleaming armor covers its leathery, pale-gray hide, and a great

black horn juts from the middle of its forehead. Clutching a wicked hal-

berd, it fixes its beady black eyes on you, as if to discern your intentions.

Although they reside on Arcadia, rheks are not native to that

plane.  They  originally  hail  from  somewhere  on  the  Material

Plane and were brought willingly to Arcadia by powerful mem-

bers of a planar faction called the Harmonium. The rheks first

appeared on Arcadia shortly after Menausus, formerly the third

layer  of  Arcadia,  dissolved  and  became  one  with  the  plane  of

Rhek Chaosgrinder

The rhek chaosgrinder is a highly focused rhek soldier trained

in hand-to-hand combat. It uses its Improved Overrun feat to

wade into combat, then unloads with a flurry of blows. Its gore

attack deals 1d4 points of additional holy damage (instead of 1

point, as noted) against evil outsiders and evil undead because

of the Sanctify Natural Attack feat.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): The rhek chaosgrinder may make a

full attack unarmed and gain an extra attack at +14/+14/+9/+4.

Ki Strike  (Su): A  rhek  chaosgrinders  unarmed  attacks  are

treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to

creatures with damage reduction.

Unarmed  Strike: The  rhek  chaosgrinder  gains  Improved

Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.

When  a  character  of  great  virtue  dies  while

another person is in her care, she sometimes

clings  to  a  form  of  life  as  a  sacred  watcher.

Not undead but deathless, a sacred watcher is very similar to

a ghost. Rather than haunting the place of her death or other-

wise harassing the living, however, a sacred guardian continues

to  watch  over  her  ward  until  someone  else  can  assume  that

responsibility.

Normally,  a  sacred  watcher  exists  on  the  Ethereal  Plane,

where she can still watch over her ward but remain mostly out

of sight. When the need arises, she can partially manifest on the

Material Plane, enough to have some effect on her surround-

ings  while  remaining  incorporeal.  On  the  Ethereal  Plane,  a

sacred watcher looks much as she did in life, except that she is

surrounded with a softly glowing nimbus of silvery light. When

manifested,  she  appears  insubstantial  and  translucent,  as

though formed completely out of her silvery radiance.

This example uses a 5th-level human fighter as the base crea-

turein  fact,  a  very  similar  fighter  to  the  one  used  as  the

example for the ghost template in the Monster Manual.

:

Speed: Sacred watchers have a fly speed of

30  feet,  unless  the  base  creature  has  a

higher  fly  speed,  with  perfect  maneuver-

ability.

Armor Class: Natural armor is the same as

the  base  creature  but  applies  only  to  ethereal

encounters.  When  the  sacred  watcher

manifests  (see  below)  its  natural  armor

value  is  +0,  but  it  gains  a  deflection

bonus equal to its Charisma modifier

or +1, whichever is higher.

Attack: The  sacred  watcher

retains all the attacks of the base

creature, although those rely-

ing  on  physical  contact  do

not  affect  non  ethereal

creatures.

Full Attack: The sacred

watcher  retains  all  the

attacks  of  the  base  crea-

ture, although those rely-

ing  on  physical  contact

do not affect non ethe-

real creatures.

Damage: Against

ethereal  creatures,  a

sacred  watcher  uses  the

base  creatures  damage

ratings.  Against  non

ethereal  creatures,

the  sacred  watcher

usually  cannot  deal

physical  damage  at

all but can use its spe-

cial  attacks,  if  any,

when  it  manifests  (see

below).

Special Attacks: The sacred watcher retains all the special

attacks of the base creature, although those relying on physical

contact do not affect non ethereal creatures. The sacred watcher

also gains a manifestation ability plus 1 to 3 other special at-

tacks described below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 sacred watch-

ers  HD  +  sacred  watchers  Charisma  modifier  unless  noted

otherwise.

Manifestation  (Su):  Every  sacred  watcher  has  this  ability.  A

sacred watcher dwells on the Ethereal Plane and as an ethereal

creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the mate-

rial world. When a sacred watcher manifests it partly enters the

Material  plane  and  becomes  visible  but  incorporeal  on  the

Material plane. The manifested sacred watcher can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons,

183

620_88026_ExaltedDeeds2a.qxd  8/27/03  11:28 AM  Page 184

or magic, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a cor-

poreal source. The manifested sacred watcher can pass through

solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. The

manifested sacred watcher can always move silently.

A manifested sacred watcher can strike with its touch attack

or a ghost touch weapon. If it has a weapon with at least a +1

enhancement  bonus,  it  can  use  this  weapon  against  material

creatures, but any such attack has a 50% chance to fail unless the

weapon is a ghost touch weapon (just as magical weapons can

fail to harm the ghost). A manifested sacred watcher remains

partially  on  the  Ethereal  Plane,  where  is  it  not  incorporeal.

Opponents on either the Material or Ethereal planes can attack

a manifested sacred watcher. The sacred watchers incorporeal-

ity  helps  protect  it  from  foes  on  the  Material  plane,  but  not

against foes on the Ethereal plane.

When a spellcasting sacred watcher is not manifested and is

on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Mate-

rial  Plane,  but  they  work  normally  against  ethereal  targets.

When  a  spellcasting  sacred  watcher  manifests,  its  spells  con-

tinue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Mate-

rial Plane normally unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested

sacred  watchers  touch  spells  dont  work  on  material  targets.

A sacred watcher has two home planes, the Material and the

Ethereal, and it is not considered extraplanar on either plane.

Positive  Energy  Touch  (Su):  A  sacred  watcher  can  make  a  hit

with an incorporeal touch attack to infuse a target with positive

energy. Undead foes (even incorporeal ones) take an additional

2d8+5 points of damage. The sacred watcher can channel this

positive energy into living creatures as well, healing up to 2d8+5

points  of  damage. The  sacred  watcher  can  control  its  positive

energy  enough  to  avoid  healing  living  foes  (dealing  only  the

base damage). This power can be used up to five times per day.

Special Qualities: A sacred watcher has all the special quali-

ties of the base creature and those listed below, and gains the

deathless type.

Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, its difficult to destroy a sacred

watcher  through  simple  combat:  The  destroyed  spirit  often

restores  itself  in  2d4  days.  Even  the  most  powerful  spells  are

often  only  temporary  solutions.  A  sacred  watcher  that  would

otherwise be destroyed returns to its mission with a successful

level check (1d20 + sacred watchers level or HD) against DC 16.

As a rule, the only way to conclusively end a sacred watchers

existence is to ensure it fulfills the purpose that sustains it.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A sacred watcher has +4 turn resistance.

Ward (Su): A sacred watcher is constantly aware of her wards

precise  location  and  status:  whether  he  is  unharmed,

wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, dead, and

so on. She can move instantly to her wards location as though

using greater teleport, except that this ability allows her to cross

planar boundaries. She can only transport herself and up to 50

pounds of ethereal objects. She can also scry on her ward at

will  (as  though  she  had  cast  scrying),  with  no  saving  throw

allowed and success guaranteed.

Abilities: Same as the base creature, except that the sacred

watcher  has  no  Constitution  score,  and  its  Charisma  score

increases by +4.

Skills: Sacred watchers receive a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

Search,  and  Spot  checks.  Otherwise  same  as  the  base  creature.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Any good.

Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature +5.

Mortal  by  birth,  celestial  by  virtue:  a  saint  is  the  epitome  of

exalted mortal nature. When a living creature lives her entire

life as an exemplar of the principles of good, she may become a

saint. See Sainthood in Chapter 2 for more information about

the process of sanctification.

A saint looks no different than she did before achieving sanc-

tification, though she is surrounded by a palpable aura of holi-

ness that sometimes (though not always) takes visible form in

her protective aura of light.

This example uses a 7th-level human paladin as the base crea-

ture.

Combat

This saint is a model of warrior virtue, fighting fairly, offering

quarter, and defending the cause of good to the death.

Holy Power (Su): The save DCs of any and all of the saints

special attacks, including spells as well as spell-like, supernatu-

ral, and extraordinary abilities, increase by +2.

additional 1d6 points of holy damage against evil creatures, and

Creating a Saint

Saint is an acquired template that can be added to any living

creature of good alignment that is not an outsider or an elemen-

tal (referred to hereafter as the base creature). See Sainthood in

Chapter  2  for  more  information  about  becoming  a  saint.

Size  and  Type: The  creatures  type

changes  to  outsider.  The  saint  has  the

native subtype. Size is unchanged.

saint  gains  an

insight  bonus

to AC equal to the char-

acters  Wisdom  bonus.

Special Attacks: A saint

retains all the characters spe-

cial attacks and gains those listed

below.

Holy Power (Su): The save DCs

of any and all of the saints

special  attacks,  includ-

ing  spells  as  well  as

spell-like,  supernat-

ural, and extraordi-

nary  abilities,

increase  by  +2.

Holy  Touch

(Su): A  saints

entire  being  is  suf-

fused with holy power,

which  likewise  flows

into  any  weapon  the  saint

any  weapon  (or  unarmed)

deal  an  additional  1d6

points  of  holy  damage

against evil creatures, and

1d8  points  against  evil

undead  and  evil  outsiders.  Any

evil creature that strikes a saint with a natu-

ral  weapon  takes  holy  damage  as  if  hit  by  the  saints  attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willguidance, resistance, virtue, and bless.

A saints caster level is equal to its Hit Die total. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

Special Qualities: A saint retains all the characters special

qualities  and  gains  those  listed  below,  as  well  as  the  outsider

and petrification attacks.

Keen Vision (Ex): Saints have low-light vision and 60-foot dark-

self with a nimbus of light having a radius of 20 feet. This acts as

a double-strength magic circle against evil and as a lesser globe of

invulnerability, both as cast by a cleric whose level equal to the

SANCTIFIED CREATURE

When an evil creature is subjected to a sanctify the wicked spell,

it  gives  up  special  qualities,  attacks,  and  abilities  that  are

inherently evil in exchange for more benevolent powers. The

sanctified  creatures  appearance  does  not  change  to  suit  its

new outlook, nor does it immediately find acceptance among

other  good  creatures.  For  this  reason,  many  sanctified  crea-

tures choose to have their form magically altered so that their

good  intentions  and  eager  pursuit  of  repentance  are  not

obscured by their vile appearance.

Many sanctified creatures feel a burning desire to purge their

past  evil  deeds  by  performing  selfless  acts  and  heroic  deeds.

They pursue their newfound dedication to good with the zeal of

an archon. Some strive to destroy evil where they find it, while

others  try  to  persuade  other  evil  creatures  to  seek  similar

enlightenment.  With  their  outlook  having  changed  to  good,

many sanctified creatures feel compelled to take up arms to pro-

tect the good and the innocent. Sometimes they join with celes-

tials and good-aligned adventurers to fight evil head-on.

A sanctified creature that reverts to evil, deliberately or not,

loses all benefits of this template. Essentially, it is restored to its

state prior to becoming a sanctified creature.

Sample Sanctified Creature

Sanctified Young Red Dragon

Large Dragon (Fire)

Hit Dice: 10d12+30 (95 hp)

Initiative: +4

186

A sanctified red dragon looks virtually identical in form from

its evil kin, except its eyes glow like pools of golden radiance,

and it keeps itself neatly groomed. Once a selfish, greedy crea-

ture, now it pursues higher goals, striving to help others and

defeat evil.

Combat

The sanctified red dragons natural weapons, and any weapons it

wields, are considered good weapons for purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Breath Weapon (Su): 40-ft. cone, 4d10 fire, Reflex save DC 18.

Light Ray (Su): Once per round, as a standard action, the

sanctified red dragon can fire a ray of searing light from its

eyes. The ray is treated as a ranged touch attack and has a max-

imum  range  of  60  feet.  Against  evil  creatures,  the  ray  deals

5d6  points  of  damage.  The  light  has  no  harmful  effect  on

nonevil creatures.

Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds the sanc-

tified red dragon. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of

it must make a DC 20 Will save to resist its effects. Those who

fail take a 2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for one day or

until they successfully hit the sanctified red dragon. A creature

that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by

this sanctified red dragons aura for one day.

Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil

effect always surrounds the sanctified red dragon, as the magic

circle against evil spell. Caster level 10th.

Tongues (Su): The very young red dragon can speak with any

creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell cast

by 10th-level sorcerer. This ability is always active.

Creating an Sanctified Creature

Sanctified creature is an acquired template that can be added

to any evil creature except for outsiders with the evil subtype

(referred to hereafter as base creature). The sanctified creature

retains its creature type. Outsiders gain the good subtype and

lose  any  of  the  following  subtypes:  baatezu  (devil),  tanarri

(demon),  and  yugoloth.  If  the  base  creature  had  the  fiendish

creature template, it loses the template and all special attacks

and special qualities granted by the template. It uses all the base

creatures  statistics  or  special  abilities  except  as  noted  here.

Attacks: The  sanctified  creature  retains  all  of  its  natural

weapons  and  attack  bonuses.  A  sanctified  creatures  natural

weapons, and any weapons it wields, are considered good weap-

ons for purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Special Attacks: The sanctified creature loses all of its preex-

isting supernatural and spell-like abilities, but retains its extraor-

dinary abilities. It also gains the light ray special ability (described

below).

Light Ray (Su): Once per round, as a standard action, the sanc-

tified creature can fire a ray of light from its eyes or hand. The

ray is treated as a ranged touch attack and has a maximum range

of  60  feet.  Against  evil  creatures,  the  ray  deals  1d6  points  of

damage per 2 HD of the sanctified creature (maximum 10d6).

The light has no harmful effect on nonevil creatures.

Special Qualities: The sanctified creature loses all of its pre-

existing  supernatural  and  spell-like  abilities,  but  retains  its

extraordinary abilities. If the base creature has damage reduc-

tion  that  can  be  bypassed  with  good  weapons,  the  sanctified

creatures  damage  reduction  changes  so  that  evil  weapons

bypass it instead.

A sanctified creature also gains the following special qualities:

Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds the sanctified

creature.  Any  hostile  creature  within  a  20-foot  radius  of  the

sanctified creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the sanc-

tified creatures Hit Dice + the sanctified creatures Cha modi-

fier)  to  resist  its  effects. Those  who  fail  take  a  2  penalty  on

attacks, AC, and saves for one day or until they successfully hit

the sanctified creature that generated the aura. A creature that

has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by that

sanctified creatures aura for one day.

Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect

always  surrounds  the  sanctified  creature,  as  the  magic  circle

against evil spell (caster level equals the sanctified creatures Hit

Dice, maximum 14th).

Tongues (Su): A sanctified creature can speak with any

creature  that  has  a  language,  as

though  using  a  tongues spell

(caster  level  equals  the

sanctified  creatures  Hit

Dice,  maximum  14th).

This  ability  is  always

active.

Feats: The sanctified

creature  loses  any  vile

feats  the  base  creature

possessed  (see  the

Book  of  Vile  Darkness).

It  does  not  get  to  re-

place these feats with

new ones. However, if

it  has  the  good  sub-

type,  it  gains  access  to

exalted feats.

Environment:  Same

as  base  creature,  al-

though the plane of res-

idence  usually  changes

to  a  good-aligned  outer

plane.

Challenge  Rating:

Same as base creature +1.

Alignment: Always good.

The sanctified creatures chaos/

law axis does not change.

Level  Adjustment: Same  as

base creature +2.

SWARM, DIVINE WRATH

When Kord, the deity of strength, wanted to punish Ezyk the

barbarian king for an ignoble defeat on the field of battle, he

sent a swarm of bronze locusts to burn down Ezyks stronghold

and devour the kings sons, ensuring the end of Ezyks blood-

line. When Thassel Tallstalk, a halfling paladin of the church of

Pelor, returned home to find his family sucked dry by his vam-

piric nemesis, he prayed to his god to send a swarm of sunflies

to reduce the vampire to ashesa wish so unbridled in its hate

that Pelor had no choice but to refuse.

Divine wrath swarms are instruments of vengeance used spar-

ingly by deities to punish the wicked, the decadent, or the deceitful.

They are also sent as harbingers of calamities and cataclysms proph-

esied by ancient seers and oracles. As manifestations of divine inter-

vention, they are far deadlier than typical creature swarms.

Four types of divine wrath swarms are presented here, but

other types exist. For rules on creating new swarms, consult the

Monster Manual.

APOCALYPSE FROG SWARM

Diminutive Magical Beast (Swarm)

Hit Dice: 5d10 (27 hp)

Initiative: +2

Speed: 20 ft. (4 squares)

Armor Class: 16 (+4 size, +2 Dex), touch 16, flat-footed 14

Base Attack/Grapple: +5/

Attack: Swarm (1d6 plus eternal torpor)

Full Attack: Swarm (1d6 plus eternal torpor)

Space/Reach: 5 ft./0 ft.

Special Attacks: Distraction, eternal torpor

Special Qualities: Low-light vision, retributive aura, swarm

traits

Saves: Fort +6, Ref +6, Will +3

Abilities: Str 1, Dex 14, Con 11, Int 1, Wis 14, Cha 4

Skills: Jump +12, Listen +4, Spot +4

Feats: Ability Focus (retributive aura), Great Fortitude

Environment: Any

Organization: Solitary, orchestra (25), or symphony (612)

Challenge Rating: 4

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always neutral

Advancement: None

A  sleek  amphibian  with  glossy  green  skin,  webbed  toes,  and

black eyes, the apocalypse frog bears a golden starburst pattern

on  its  back.  Apocalypse  frogs  croak  incessantly,  and  in  large

numbers their croaking can be heard for miles. Deities use them

as harbingers of doom, sending apocalypse frog swarms to com-

munities rife with evil or plagued by injustice as a warning of

some greater calamity yet to come.

Combat

An apocalypse frog swarm can be a nuisance to good creatures,

but it carries an affliction called eternal torpor that is detrimen-

tal to evil creatures.

Distraction  (Ex): Any  living  creature  that  begins  its  turn

with an apocalypse frog swarm in its square must make a DC 12

Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Con-

stitution-based.

Eternal  Torpor  (Su): Any  evil  creature  wounded  by  the

swarm must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or succumb to eternal

torpor  (an  affliction  described  in  Chapter  3:  Exalted  Equip-

ment).

Retributive Aura (Su): This effect is always active in a 30-

foot-radius spread centered on the swarm. Whenever the apoc-

alypse frog swarm takes damage from any source, every creature

within the area immediately takes an equal amount of damage.

A successful DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage. Regard-

less of the source of the damage to the swarm, the damage dealt

to  other  creatures  by  this  effect  is  not  subject  to  negation  or

reduction because of resistance, damage reduction, spell resist-

ance, or the like. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swarm Traits: A swarm of apocalypse frogs takes no damage

from  slashing  and  piercing  weapons.  It  is  immune  to  critical

hits, flanking, and spells that target a certain number of crea-

tures  (such  as  disintegrate). The  swarm  takes  a  10  penalty  on

saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as

many  evocation  spells  or  grenadelike  weapons.  If  the  area

effect  attack  does  not  allow  a  saving  throw,  the  swarm  takes

double damage instead. Swarms are never staggered or reduced

pled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.

The  swarm  deals  automatic  damage  to  any  creature  whose

Bronze locusts are miniature constructs meticulously crafted by

artisans in the forges of the upper planes. Their gleaming cara-

wise they resemble ordinary locusts. Each bronze locust has its

own miniscule furnace capable of generating white-hot gouts of

flame.  The  locusts  are  also  equipped  with  adamantine

mandibles that allow them to chew through stone, metal, and

other constructs as easily as they chew through flesh.

Combat

The bronze locust swarm surrounds and attacks anything that

gets  in  its  way,  including  fortifications. The  swarm  deals  3d6

damage to any creature or object whose space it occupies at the

end of its move.

The bronze locusts are treated as adamantine weapons for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

120 ft., swarm traits

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn with

a bronze locust swarm in its square must make a DC 17 Fortitude

save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-

based.

Divine Fire (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, as a free action,

the bronze locusts can spew forth tiny gouts of divine fire

that collectively deal 2d6 points of damage to any creature or

object  in  the  swarms  square.  Half  of  the  damage  is  fire

damage,  but  the  other  half  results  directly  from  divine

power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by

resistance to fire-based attacks. The fire also ignites

combustibles.

Construct Traits: A bronze locust swarm

has immunity to poison, magic sleep effects,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy

effects,  mind-affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,

phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale  effects),  and  any  effect

that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on

objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, sub-

dual  damage,  ability  damage,  ability  drain,  fatigue,

exhaustion,  or  energy  drain.  Cannot  heal  damage,  but

can  be  repaired.  Darkvision  60  ft.  and  low-light

vision.

Swarm Traits:

A  swarm  of  bronze

locusts  is  immune  to

weapon  damage,  critical

hits,  flanking,  and  spells

that  target  a  certain  number

of creatures (such as disinte-

grate). The swarm takes

a  10  penalty  on

saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as

many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect

attack  does  not  allow  a  saving  throw,  the  swarm  takes  double

damage instead (however, see Construct Traits, above). Swarms

are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also,

they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot

grapple another.

Deathravens are black crows with gleaming silver eyes

and  sharp  black  talons. They  usually  appear  at  dusk  or

just after midnight, bringing death and woe to all who

encounter them.

Combat

Deathraven  swarms  are  sent  to  dispatch  truly  vile

and  despicable  beings.  Creatures  enveloped  by  a

deathraven swarm are more likely to succumb

to its touch of death ability than its compara-

bly  weak  claw  and  bite  attacks,  although

deathravens  sometimes  feast  on

their  victims  flesh,  leaving  noth-

ing behind but bare bones.

Unlike  most  other  swarms,  a

deathraven  swarm  can  grapple  foes  and

items, lifting a Medium or smaller creature off

its  feet  and  sweeping  it  up  into  the  sky.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that

begins its turn with a deathraven swarm in its square

must  make  a  DC  21  Fortitude  save  or  be  nauseated  for  1

round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Pluck  Eyes  (Ex): Each  round  the  deathraven  swarm  deals

damage to a creature, there is a 20% chance that it plucks out the

creatures eyes, blinding it permanently. A remove blindness/deaf-

ness spell does not replace the lost eyes or cure the blindness. A

heal spell restores both the creatures eyes and its vision.

Touch  of  Death  (Su): Any  living  creature  wounded  by  a

deathraven swarm must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or die. A

creature killed by a deathraven swarm cannot be raised, rein-

carnated, or resurrected. Only a wish or miracle spell can restore

a life taken by this swarm. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swarm Traits: A swarm of deathravens takes half damage

from slashing and piercing weapons. It is immune to critical

hits, flanking, and spells that target a certain number of crea-

tures (such as disintegrate). The swarm takes a 10 penalty on

saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such

as many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area

effect attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes

double  damage  instead.  Swarms  are  never  staggered  or

reduced  to  a  dying  state  by  damage.  Also,  they  cannot  be

tripped, grappled, or bull rushed.

The  swarm  deals  automatic  damage  to  any  creature  whose

space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll

needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for con-

cealment or cover.

Skills: A deathraven swarm gains a +8 racial bonus on Spot

checks.

Sunflies are native to the planes of good. Individually, they are

used as messengers and couriers by archons, planar petitioners,

and clerics of Pelor. They are only dangerous in swarms, gnaw-

ing on evil creatures that are dazzled by their celestial radiance.

A sunfly resembles a large, golden dragonfly with an eldritch,

otherworldly quality. Their legs are long and spindly, their eyes

are bright and rainbow-colored, and their silvery wings are gos-

samer-thin. They also have mothlike antennae that catch sun-

light like dew-coated spidersilk.

Combat

The sunfly swarm surrounds and attacks anything that gets in

its way. The swarm deals 2d6 damage to any creature or object

whose space it occupies at the end of its move.

The sunfly swarms natural attacks are treated as good weap-

ons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Dazzling Distraction (Ex): Any creature that begins its turn

with a sunfly swarm in its square is automatically dazzled and, if

living, must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1

round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect evil (always active), detect

evil (always active). Caster level 10th.

Sunburst (Sp): Three times per day, a sunfly swarm can dupli-

cate the effects of a sunburst spell cast by a 20th-level cleric with

access to the Sun domain. A successful DC 19 Reflex save halves

the damage and negates the blindness effect. The swarm cannot

deal damage during the same round it uses the sunburst ability.

The save DC is Wisdom-based.

Sundance (Su): Once per round, a sunfly swarm can perform

a dance that duplicates the effects of a protection from evil spell,

affecting both the swarm and any creature occupying the same

square. The swarm cannot deal damage during the same round

it performs the sundance.

Immunity to Light: Sunfly swarms are immune to harmful

or debilitating light spells and effects, including all spells with

the light descriptor.

Outsider Traits: A  sunfly  swarm  cannot  be  raised,  reincar-

nated or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true res-

urrection spell can restore life). Darkvision 60 ft. Sunflies do not

need to eat or sleep.

Swarm  Traits: A  swarm  of  sunflies  is  immune  to  weapon

damage,  critical  hits,  flanking,  and  spells  that  target  a  certain

number of creatures (such as disintegrate). The swarm takes a 10

penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affect an

area, such as many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If

the area effect attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm

takes  double  damage  instead.  Swarms  are  never  staggered  or

reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped,

grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.

The  swarm  deals  automatic  damage  to  any  creature  whose

space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll

needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for con-

cealment or cover.

The Book of Vile Darkness presented the tools and legions

of evil, and now the Book of Exalted Deeds does the same

for the celestial host. Within its pages are exalted feats,

spells,  and  magic  items,  as  well  as  the  celestial

paragonsthe good counterparts of the Dukes of Hell

and  the  Demon  Princes.  Though  most  of  the  celestial

paragons do not personally sponsor cadres of followers,

individual champions nonetheless dedicate themselves

to furthering the agendas of these creatures.

The Book of Exalted Deeds offers one champion for each

celestial paragon detailed in its pages. This article presents

three moreone for a lawful good paragon of Celestia,

one for the queen of the chaotic good Court of Stars, and

one for a member of the neutral good Companions.

CHUUD, CHAMPION

OF SEALTIEL

Chuud is dedicated to Sealtiel. She can be called with a

greater planar ally or greater planar binding spell.

As  a  half-celestial,  Chuud  places  more  emphasis  on

the good portion of that ethos than other fellow rheks

do. All her life, Chuud has honed her body and mind for

defense, like the others of her kind. But while they were

content  in  defending  their  own  realm,  Chuud  sought

more.  A  sense  of  responsibility  deep  within  her  drove

her  to  offer  her  services  to  the  Celestial  Hebdomad.

Sealtiel the Defender recognized Chuuds potential and

took  her  into  his  army.  Realizing  that  defense  of  this

realm  was  her  lifes  work,  Chuud  dedicated  herself  to

Sealtiels service and became one of his elite.

Now  Chuud  goes  where  Sealtiel  directs,  using  her

incredible strength and her twin smite abilities to battle

enemies of Celestia wherever they may be. Mounted on

her celestial rhino Armorplate, she presents a terrifying

sight to those who embrace chaos and evil.

Chuud stands 7 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds. She

is bald and has a single horn and scaly skin like most of

her  kind,  but  her  scales  gleam  golden,  and  her  eyes

glow with holy fire.

Ranged Smite Evil**, Resounding Blow**, Servant of

the Heavens**.

Daylight  (Su): At  will,  Chuud  can  produce  a

daylight effect, as the spell.

Powerful Charge (Ex): Chuud typically begins a

battle by charging at an opponent, lowering her head to

bring  her  mighty  horn  into  play.  In  addition  to  the

normal  benefits  and  hazards  of  a  charge,  this  tactic

allows  Chuud  to  make  a  single  gore  attack  that  deals

2d8+14 points of damage.

Smite Chaos (Su): Three times per day, Chuud can

make a normal attack with a +2 bonus on the attack roll.

If  successful,  this  attack  deals  an  additional  5  points  of

damage against a chaotic foe. If she accidentally smites a

creature that is not chaotic, the smite has no effect, but

the attempt still uses up one daily use of the ability.

Smite  Evil  (Su): Twice  per  day,  Chuud  may

attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She

adds  +3  to  her  attack  roll  and  deals  an  additional  8

points  of  damage.  In  addition,  because  she  is  a  half-

celestial, she can smite evil once per day with a normal

melee attack to deal an additional 18 points of damage.

In either case, if she accidentally smites a creature that

is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the attempt still

uses up one daily use of the ability.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayholy aura (DC 21),

protection  from  evil; 1/dayaid,  bless,  cure  serious  wounds

(DC  16), detect  evil,  dispel  evil (DC  18), hallow (DC  18),

holy smite (DC 17), holy word (DC 20), mass charm monster

(DC 17), neutralize poison, remove disease, summon monster

IX (celestials only). Caster level 18th. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

2

Aura of Courage (Su): Chuud is immune to fear,

magical or otherwise. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains

a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

Aura  of  Good  (Ex): Chuud  has  a  strong  aura  of

good.

Blood of the Martyr(Sp): Once per day, Chuud

can use blood of the martyr**, as the spell (caster level 5th).

Defensive  Stance  (Ex): When  Chuud  invokes

this ability, her statistics change as follows: HD 5d8+40

plus  8d10+64  plus  5d12+40;  hp  242;  AC  40,  touch  20,

flat-footed 35; Grp +28; Atk +28 melee (1d8+15, gore) or

+33/+28/+23/+18  melee  (1d10+20/(cid:2)3,  +5  defending

holy  evil  outsider  bane  halberd)  and  +23  melee  (1d8+5,

gore); SA powerful charge 2d8+30; SV Fort +30, Ref +21,

Will +25; Str 31, Con 27; Concentration +12.

While  in  a  defensive  stance,  Chuud  cannot  move

from her position, nor can she use skills or abilities that

would  require  her  to  shift  her  position,  such  as  Move

Silently  or  Jump.  Her  defensive  stance  lasts  for  9

rounds, though she may voluntarily end the effect prior

to that limit. At the end of the defensive stance, Chuud

is  winded  and  takes  a  2  penalty  to  Strength  for  the

duration of that encounter.

Detect Chaos (Sp): Chuud  can  use  detect  chaos

three times per day, as the spell (caster level 5th).

Detect Evil(Sp): Chuud can use detect evil at will

as the spell (caster level 8th).

Divine Grace: Chuud applies her Charisma bonus

to  all  saving  throws.  (This  modifier  is  already  figured

into the statistics given above.)

Divine Health: Chuud is immune to all diseases,

including  magical  diseases  such  as  mummy  rot  and

lycanthropy.

Magic Natural Weapons: Chuuds gore attack is

treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcom-

ing damage reduction.

Instant  Stability  (Su): Chuud  has  redundant

internal organs and rapidly congealing blood. She auto-

matically  stabilizes  when  reduced  to  1  to  9  hp,

though she still dies when reduced to 10 hp or below.

Lay on Hands (Su): Chuud can heal wounds (her

own or those of others) by touch. Each day, she can heal

24  hit  points  of  damage.  She  may  choose  to  divide  her

healing among multiple recipients, and she doesnt have

to use it all at once. Alternatively, she can use any or all of

this  healing  to  deal  damage  to  undead  creatures.  Using

lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch

attack and doesnt provoke an attack of opportunity.

Magic  Circle

is  constantly

surrounded by an effect that duplicates the magic circle

against evil spell (caster level 5th).

DWAECOR, CHAMPION

OF FAERINAAL

Dwaecor  is  dedicated  to  Faerinaal.  He  can  be  called

with a planar ally or planar binding spell.

Many decades ago, Dwaecor once rendered a service

to the Court of Stars. As a reward, Faerinaal brought the

young djinni to the Court of Stars and presented him

with Artilf, the weapon of a former champion slain in

the battle against evil.

Captivated  with  the  beauty  of  the  queen  and  her

consort,  Dwaecor  swore  his  allegiance  to  Faerinaal  on

the  spot  and  has  never  wavered.  His  tasks  take  him

throughout the planes, and he often travels the elemen-

tal  planes  on  Faerinaals  errands,  since  he  is  uniquely

qualified to do so.

Dwaecor  wears  loose  blue  trousers,  a  red  sash,  and

no  shirt.  His  muscular  arms  bulge  under  his  bracers,

and  his  ancestral  weapon  is  strapped  at  his  waist.  His

chest is covered with star-shaped tattoos. Dwaecor has

discovered  a  .number  of  powers  both  within  himself

and within his scimitar as an anointed knight.

3

Spell-Like  Abilities: At  willinvisibility (self

only); 1/daycreate food and water, create wine (as create

water,  but  wine  instead),  gaseous  form (1  hour),  major

creation (created vegetable matter is permanent), persist-

ent image (DC 18), wind walk. Caster level 10th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Whirlwind (Su): Dwaecor can transform himself

into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in

that form for up to 7 rounds. In this form, he can move

through the air or along a surface at his fly speed. The

whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base up to 30 feet wide at

the top, and up to 50 feet tall (at least 10 feet).

Dwaecors movement while in whirlwind form does

not  provoke  attacks  of  opportunity,  even  if  he  enters

another  creatures  space.  Another  creature  might  be

caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters it, or if

Dwaecor  moves  into  or  through  the  creatures  space.

Any  Medium  or  smaller  creature  might  take  damage

when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air.

An affected creature must succeed on a DC 23 Reflex

save upon coming into contact with the whirlwind or

take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a DC

23  Reflex  save  or  be  picked  up  bodily  and  held

suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking

1d8 points of damage each round. A creature with a fly

speed  is  allowed  a  DC  23  Reflex  save  each  round  to

escape  the  whirlwind.  The  creature  still  takes  damage

but  can  leave  if  the  save  is  successful.  The  save  DC  is

Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment.

A  creature  trapped  in  the  whirlwind  cannot  move

except to go where Dwaecor carries it or to escape the

whirlwind.  It  can  otherwise  act  normally  but  must

make  a  Concentration  check  (DC  15  +  spell  level)  to

cast a spell. A creature caught in the whirlwind takes a

4 penalty to Dexterity and a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

Dwaecor  can  have  only  as  many  creatures  trapped

inside  a  whirlwind  at  one  time  as  will  fit  inside  the

whirlwinds  volume.  Dwaecor  can  eject  any  carried

creatures whenever he wishes, depositing them wher-

ever the whirlwind happens to be.

If  the  whirlwinds  base  touches  the  ground,  it

creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered

on Dwaecor and has a diameter equal to half the whirl-

winds height. The cloud obscures all vision, including

darkvision,  beyond  5  feet.  Creatures  5  feet  away  have

concealment,  while  those  farther  away  have  total

concealment.  Anyone  caught  in  the  cloud  must

succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level)

to  cast  a  spell.  While  in  whirlwind  form,  Dwaecor

cannot  make  melee  attacks  and  does  not  threaten  the

area around him.

Ancestral Weapon Benefits: Artilf, Dwaecors

ancestral scimitar has the following abilities in addition

to being a holy weapon.

Sunder Resistance: The scimitar has an extra 10 points

of hardness.

Unicorns  Blood  (Su): Any  evil  creature  wounded  by

Dwaecors scimitar must make a DC 17 Fortitude save

or  suffer  the  weakening  effects  of  unicorns  blood

(Injury  DC  17,  initial  damage  1d3  Str,  secondary

damage 1d4 Str).

Deep Strike: Three times per day, on a successful

attack, Dwaecor deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.

Inspired  Strike: Three  times  per  day,  Dwaecor

can take a single extra attack at his highest attack bonus

as a free action.

Outsider  Traits: Darkvision  60  ft.;  cannot  be

raised  or  resurrected  (though  a  wish  or  miracle  spell

can restore life).

Plane Shift (Sp): Dwaecor  can  enter  any  of  the

elemental  planes,  the  Astral  Plane,  or  the  Material

Plane. This ability transports him and up to eight other

creatures, provided they all link hands with him. This

effect is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name

(caster level 13th).

Possessions: Artilf, +2 holy scimitar (sunder resistance**,

unicorns  blood**),  bracers  of  armor  +5,  ring  of  protection

+5, belt of giant strength +4, cloak of Charisma +2, horn of fog.

HODARUN,

CHAMPION OF VHARA

Hodarun is dedicated to Vhara. He can be called with a

planar ally or planar binding spell.

Hodarun was never quite like the other centaurs of

his tribe. Though they were all good of heart, Hodarun

somehow  seemed  better  than  the  otherssmarter,

wiser,  and  much  more  good. It  was  he  who  would  aid

others in any enterprise, from righteous battle to haul-

ing water in a drought. He learned the arts of war like

many others of his tribe, but he refused to fight other

intelligent  creatures  unless  he  considered  the  battle

just.  All  the  while,  he  had  occasional  visions  of  the

Duchess of the Fields, who told him he was destined for

greater things.

Once  fateful  day,  Hodarun  and  his  fellows  were

captured by a hobgoblin warband. The hobgoblins also

held  nearly  one  hundred  human  prisoners  from  a

nearby town they had sacked. The humans were being

kept as slaves, and one was slain and eaten each day. The

hobgoblins  let  their  prisoners  know  that  the  most

4

troublesome would be eaten first. Hodarun, unable to

sit  by  and  watch  such  evil,  overcame  his  guard  and

freed  the  remaining  humans.  When  the  hobgoblins

discovered the escape, he blocked their way in a narrow

mountain  pass,  determined  to  hold  them  off  long

enough for the humans to make good their escape. He

succeeded in his goal, but fell from his own wounds.

Not content to allow him a heros death, the hobgob-

lins  took  the  dying  Hodarun  back  to  their  camp  and

healed  some  of  his  wounds.  For  weeks,  they  tortured

him daily, then partially healed him at night. Just when

he thought he could bear no more, Vhara appeared to

him  and  said,  Over  and  over  you  have  placed  others

above  yourself.  Such  a  giving  heart  is  worthy  of

reward. When he awoke, a nimbus of light surrounded

him. The hobgoblins, recognizing the light as a mani-

festation of the higher powers of good, decided not to

risk attracting further notice from the good deities. So

they bound Hodarun and his fellows and moved their

camp  elsewhere,  abandoning  the  centaurs.  With  his

newfound  saintly  powers  in  addition  to  his  many

talents,  Hodarun  freed  his  companions,  healed  their

wounds, and found them food. He then brought them

back to the tribe, whose members hailed him as a saint.

After that incident, Hodarun took up the mantle of

cleric  and  devoted  himself  to  Vhara  as  her  personal

champion. He continues to fight evil wherever he finds

it, and to listen to his inner voice at all times.

Hodarun resembles a well-muscled centaur, but his

coat is white and his hair is golden and braided with red

phoenix  feathers.  His  eyes  are  a  deep  brown  with

golden glints. An aura of white light surrounds either

his whole body or just his head, as he wishes.
