Champions of Valor is for players and Dungeon

Masters who want to incorporate great heroism

into their campaigns. This is more than simply

a list of good deeds and good traits, for a lowly peasant can do

good deeds or embody good traits, intentionally or accidentally.

The use of the word valor in the book title is signi cant; it

means  courage  and  boldness,  the  qualities  of  a  hero,  and

exceptional courage when facing danger. Compare these means

to the contextual meaning of the word good; a thief might be

good at picking a pocket, an assassin good at murder, and a black-

guard good at cowing his enemies, but none of those things are

valorous or heroic. This book is about valorous charactersthose

who  might  be  good  or  in  some  cases  merely  neutral,  but  are

great and heroic in facing down the greatest dangers of Faern.

Most valorous characters are good, but a signi cant fraction of

them are indifferent to good and evil, and a rare few are evil

but recognize that some evils must be challenged (even the mad

Halaster has battled on Mystras behalf).

Its worth noting that if you look at the ratio of good, neutral,

and evil deities in Faern, there are a disproportionate number

of good-aligned deities compared to neutral or evil deities. You

see this if you compare the thirty fully described deities in the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, or just the greater and

intermediate  deities  of  Faern,  or  all  the  deities  described  in

Chapter 5 of that book: Good-aligned deities outnumber those

with a neutral aspect, and they outnumber evil deities as well.

This means there are more good in uences in the world than

evil or neutral ones (though the evil ones tend to be more overt

and  careful  in  their  in uence).  There  are  more  good-aligned

4

adventurers in Faern than neutral or evil ones, not just because

of divine in uence but because Faern calls out for good heroes.

From the earliest version of the setting to the latest incarna-

tion, FORGOTTEN REALMS books assume that player characters

are usually good and will sometimes do things just because its

the right thing to do, not for a reward. However, it is unfair to

expect the PCs to always behave this way; part of the enjoyment

of playing D&D is seeing your character become more powerful,

and when the rewards are lacking it detracts from the experience.

One of the goals of this book is to provide DMs ways to motivate

valorous characters and reward them in atypical ways.

If youre a DM, use this book for ideas on how to encourage

your players to play valorous PCs, create valorous adventures for

those PCs, and build a campaign based on heroic deeds. You can

even use this material to guide the behavior of your villains and

villainous organizations, for one of the pinnacles of valor is chal-

lenging your evil opposite with the fate of the world at stake.

If youre a player, this book presents you with new options

for  your  characters,  whether  you  want  them  to  have  humble

beginnings and aspire to great heroism of be born destined for

greatness and aware of it from the very start. Read this book and

talk to your DM about what he expects from valorous heroes;

this book can help establish common ground so your character

doesnt stumble in mid-campaign over con icting perceptions of

what is valorous behavior.

need any of those books to use this one, some speci c ideas and

game concepts presented in those books appear here in a limited

form, and you can  nd more details in the appropriate book.

For example, this book suggests ways to incorporate the goliaths

(a  new  race  from  Races  of  Stone)  into  a  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

campaign, but only includes the briefest amount of information

on the goliath race; if you want more information on goliaths,

refer to Races of Stone.

Several other books are referenced herein. In many cases,

this reference is in the form of a superscript abbreviation of

the books title, which is tacked onto the end of the name of a

spell, monster, or some other piece of information. The books

(including some of those mentioned above) and their abbrevia-

tions, when applicable, are as follows: Book of Exalted Deeds

(BE), Champions of Ruin (CR), Complete Warrior (CW), Lost

Empires of Faern (LE), Magic of Faern (Mag), Players

Guide to Faern (PG), Races of Faern (Rac), and Unapproach-

able East (Una).

How to Use This Book

in Your Campaign

This  book  gives  you  many  options  for  running  a  valorous

campaign, running valorous PCs or NPCs, and making heroics

a critical part of your FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign. Whether

its new options for building a character, inspirational organi-

zations  a  character  can  join,  places  of  power  tied  to  heroism

and sacri ce, or new allies and companions for valorous PCs,

Champions of Valor is the key supplement for Faerns heroic

characters. Alternatively, much of this book can be used with

minor adjustments in any setting.

Introduction: What is the difference between good and valor?

Why are there are so many heroes in Faern?

Chapter  1:  The  Valorous  Hero  has  advice  for  DMs  and

players  about  valorous  campaigns,  valorous  challenges,  and

valorous archetypes by class and race. It addresses the idea of

 awed heroes, atonement, and con ict between different kinds

of good.

Chapter 2: Character Options details new regions, feats, spells,

magic items, and substitution levels tailored for Faernian deities

and organizations.

Chapter 3: Valorous Organizations covers several valorous

organizations,  including  information  on  how  to  join  and  the

bene ts of joining each group. Following that are short descrip-

tions of many valorous knighthoods, monk orders, and other

organizations.

Chapter 4: Prestige Classes introduces four new prestige classes

for valorous heroes, from the Knight of the Flying Hunt to the

Triadic Knight.

Chapter 5: Places of Valor gives sample locations associated

with good, from a holy temple to the site of a great battle.

Chapter  6:  Agents  of  Good  describes  several  new  NPCs

and monsters with descriptions and game statistics, suitable for

cohorts, allies, or contacts.

Timeline

This book assumes that the current year is the Year of Lightning

Storms (1374 DR).

Swift and Immediate Actions

Some of the rules and features described in Champions of Valor

use two action types not described in the core rulebooks: the

swift action and the immediate action. A description of how

each works follows.

Swift Action: A swift action consumes a very small amount

of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy

than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn

without  affecting  your  ability  to  perform  other  actions.  In

that regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you

can perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of

what other actions you take. You can take a swift action any

time you would normally be allowed to take a free action.

Casting a quickened spell is a swift action (instead of a free

action,  as  stated  in  the  Quicken  Spell  feat  description  in  the

Players Handbook). In addition, casting any spell with a casting

time of 1 swift action (such as divest essentia) is a swift action.

Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 swift action does

not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Immediate Action: Much like a swift action, an immediate

action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents

a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action.

However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be

performed at any timeeven if its not your turn. Casting

feather fall is an immediate action (instead of a free action,

as stated in the spell description in the Players Handbook),

since the spell can be cast at any time.

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as

using a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that

turn.  You  cannot  use  another  immediate  action  or  a  swift

action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate

action when it is not currently your turn. You also cannot use

an immediate action if you are currently  at-footed

Book of Exalted Deeds addresses the concepts of

good and evil in the D&D universe. This chapter

examines those issues in the context of the FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, providing advice for DMs and

players who want more valor and heroics in their campaigns.

Good and Evil

in Faern

Faern is an interesting place, to be sure, when viewed in terms

of  good  and  evil.  The  goddess  of  magic  is  good,  so  all  magic

ultimately comes from a good source, and while she can restrict

magical access to only good creatures, she does not do so or risk

upsetting the balance of power in the world. The god of the dead

is neutral, seeing death as an inevitable thing but not something

he wants to promote or encourage before its due time. Several

nongood deities allow paladins in their service, promoting only

the  most  lawful  and  good  aspects  of  their  faith.  The  god  of

knowledge is neutral, while the gods of literature and song are

good. The protector of caravans is neutral, while the goddess of

festhalls is good. While the D&D game views good and evil in a

more black-and-white sense than what exists in the real world, it

is clear that in Faern, these concepts are not so cut-and-dried.

That  said,  we  can  use  the  godly  portfolios  to  determine

there  are  some  things  in  Faern  that  are  de nitely  good  or

evil. Nature, rather than being an indifferent or neutral force,

is often good (Chauntea, Eldath, and Mielikki are good, while

Silvanus is neutral). Hereditary rule by quali ed nobles is associ-

ated with goodCormyr is the only true human monarchy and

is considered a good nation; Mulhorand is ruled by lawful good

hereditary priest-kings; Evermeet and the Great Rift clans are

good monarchies. Light, whether sunlight or moonlight, is good

(Lathander, Selne, Horus-Re, Eilistraee, and Sehanine Moonbow

are good deities of light, dawn, or the moon). Undeath, wanton

killing,  and  destruction  are  evil  (Bhaal,  Myrkul,  Velsharoon,

Kiaransalee, Cyric, Talos, Set, and Malar). Oppression, conquest,

and in icting suffering are evil (Bane, Loviatar, Lolth, Gruumsh,

Urdlen, Deep Duerra, and Talona), as are darkness and thievery

(Mask, Shar, and Vhaeraun).

When viewed in this way, the deities of the setting help de ne

the borders of Faernian morality. In short: Life, concern for

others, and respect for nature are good, while disruptions of the

natural cycle and abuse of power are evil. Thus it is quite possible

for a powerful good government to act in an evil manner by

abusing its power,  destroying nearby lands, or engaging in war

for the sake of glory or territory.

Rewarding

Valorous Behavior

Faern is a well-developed campaign world, with an established

history and connectivity between its countries, organizations, and

powerful individuals. When something happens, others are sure

to  nd out about it and respond. The mage who destroyed the

dire doppelgangers hold on Westgate gains a reputation elsewhere

along the Dragon Coast. The Rashemi barbarian who held off

a charge of Thayan knights long enough to enable a hathran to

heal her wounded sister and escape is spoken of in Thesk and

Aglarond as well as his homeland. The heroic thief who stole the

Bloodstaff of Arkhoun from a Banite templethe night before

THE VALOROUS HERO

Fzoul was to claim itearns many rounds of drinks in Cormyr

and Waterdeep.

While it is easy to reward valorous characters with money and

magic items or to allow them to take special feats, these types

of rewards arent the only way to reinforce valorous behavior.

In the real world, people who do great deeds are often rewarded

 nancially, but quite often these rewards are minor compared

to the fame and thanks heaped upon them by those they helped.

A fantasy world with magic, true celestials, and huge areas of

pristine land has even more ways to reward valorous characters

than the real world does, and all without adding game mechanics.

A Mulhorandi high priest might reward a heroic wizard with

the power to make any creature realize the hero is a friend of

the  royal  family.  A  valorous  cleric  can  be  assigned  a  speci c

veteran celestial to watch over her, and it is this celestial that

answers her lesser planar ally and commune spells. A warrior

dragonslayer can be awarded title to the lands formerly held by

the dragon and permission to build a castle as a knighted lord

of the realm. A heroic rogue who broke the back of an assassins

guild might be given a key to the city and a position as advisor

to the local duke.

This is not to say that magic, spells, and feats arent interest-

ing and exciting ways to reward a valorous character, but since

good characters are expected to do good deeds without requiring

a reward, always giving them a material award cheapens their

actswhile  other  types  of  rewards  help  build  the  characters

reputation and establish him or her in the setting (nonmaterial

awards also avoid the problem of exceeding the recommended

amount  of  treasure  for  a  particular  character  level).  Heroes

inspire great stories, which cause others to retell and emulate those

stories, which often results in a new generation of heroes inspired

by the previous generation. In a way, that is true immortality.

How to DM for

Valorous Heroes

Running a campaign with valorous heroes requires extra work

and preparation by the Dungeon Master, but the rewards are

signi cant. In a standard campaign, PCs might be content to

escort caravans, defeat orc outposts, and dabble in heroics now

and then, but such campaigns are usually poorer in the retelling.

By comparison, a valorous campaign where the stakes are high,

the heroes larger than life, and the villains especially foul is more

likely to inspire good memories of the games and encourage the

players to even greater acts of heroism.

Valorous heroes require special care and attention. Even more

so  than  in  a  standard  campaign,  the  two  rules  of  running  a

FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign (see Chapter 8 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting) are critical. First, you must remember

that your campaign is your world. You dont need to follow the

events of the novels or campaign updates in the game supplements,

and if you need to change something to

give your characters the opportunity

to do something valorous, then by

all means do it. If you want your

valorous  PCs  to  pass  through

Tilverton  right  before  it

vanished  from  Faern,  give

them  a  chance  to  stop

whatever  causes  the

catastrophein  your

campaign, Tilverton

A small keep makes the perfect gift for a valorous knight

8/31/05   3:16:41 PM

THE VALOROUS HERO

still exists as long as the PCs intervene. If you want your PCs

to have a chance to prevent the rebirth of Bane by attacking an

avatar of Xvim, do itin your campaign, Bane might stay dead

forever if the PCs are made of the right stuff.

Second, by all means make the PCs the stars of the campaign

rather than the famous NPCs. If even the most valorous hero

gets less screen time than Drizzt DoUrden or Elminster in

your campaign, it cheapens the efforts of your PCs and makes

the players wonder why they bother trying to be valorous at all.

Give  your  PCs  the  opportunity  to  shine  and  do  great  things,

pushing NPCs out of the spotlight. If youre playing a campaign

in Cormyr during the war against Nalavara the Devil Dragon,

and your valorous Cormyrean wizard PC proves himself wise

and  mighty,  ignore  the  information  about  Caladnei  on  page

115 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting and instead

let Vangerdahast nominate the PC wizard as his successor, citing

a  long-forgotten  branch  of  the  line  of  Royal  Magicians  that

culminates in the character. Perhaps a noble-hearted duergar and

his friends were the ones who defended Mithral Hall against an

invasion of gray dwarves rather than a violet-eyed drow  ghting

against the vengeful forces of his home city. Perhaps the true

heir to the throne of Tethyr is not Zaranda Star but actually a

Chondathan mercenary  ghter PC who must battle to unite the

land he would claim as his own; in your campaign, it might not

be Khelben Arunsun who negotiated a temporary peace with the

Zhentarim, but rather an ambitious half-elf bard who then left

to form his own organization. If you make the PCs the stars and

let them perform incredible heroic deeds that affect the entire

world, the players recognize that it is they who are shaping their

gaming world, not authors and game designers.

Creating Valorous

Challenges

For heroes to truly shine with the light of valor, they must face

down the darkest evils. Theres only a small potential for valor

in an adventure focused on guarding a caravan carrying copper

ingots to the Western Heartlands. If instead the cargo is dwarven

steel to be made into swords to arm a local militia against an

invasion of Zhent soldiers, and the caravan is passing through an

area known to be patrolled by Kurn Cormaeril (vampire skymage

of the Zhentarim and traitor to the crown of Cormyr), now you

have  an  opportunity  for  heroism.  The  militia  cant  keep  this

caravan safe by itself; it needs a group of heroes to lead them

in battle so the rank-and- le soldiers wont be slaughtered. This

type of scenario has great potential for valor, even for low-level

characters and for a broad mix of character classes.

Remember  that  Faern  isnt  just  a  bland  fantasy  setting,

it  has  a  rich  and  detailed  history  that  you  can  use  to  create

scenarios tied to the world and lay the groundwork for future

adventures. A lot is going on at any moment in Faern, even if

you only look at a small area, and there should be plenty of ways

to incorporate far-reaching plot elements for valorous heroes to

seize, shake, and follow.

Champions of Ruin and Book of Vile Darkness are excellent

resources for the enemies that valorous heroes loathe,  ght, and

defeat. Even if you dont have those books, there are dozens of

adventure seeds are strewn throughout the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting and other FORGOTTEN REALMS products. In its

long history, Faern has seen several evil countries rise to power

only to collapse because of internal con ict, delving too deep into

forbidden magic, con ict with evil enemies, or destruction at the

hands of the forces of good; even dead evil empires can be the

seeds of great adventures, as misguided humanoids unearth and

use  long-buried  artifacts,  liches  and  other  immortal  evils  dig

themselves free or awake from centuries of magical imprison-

ment, or a madman tries to reconstruct the glory days of old.

Evil gods can die and still leave their legacyMoanders cultists

still try to bring him back from the dead, Myrkuls evil lingers

in the crown of horns, and so on.

Not that enough evil isnt already present in Faern to keep

valorous heroes occupied for quite some time. Thayan enclaves

can seem innocuous, but in most cases its certain that enclave

pro ts go to researching powerful and dangerous spells that the

Red Wizards will test in battles against Aglarond and Rashemen

(and if successful, the rest of the world). The new church of Bane

is the driving force behind the Zhentarim and their leader is Banes

chosen. A dozen other evil gods try to carve pieces out of the map

or from the  esh of living mortals. Thieves guilds put a chokehold

on trade in and out of a crucial port city, cutting off supplies

needed to help win a foreign war against an orc horde, while an

assassins guild literally strangles the life from a citys prestigious

families to settle an old rivalry. Bandits declare themselves kings

and take over peaceful towns, putting any resistors to the sword

and claiming the spoils of blood and innocence. Pirates attack

pilgrims vessels in the Sea of Fallen Stars and merchant vessels

on the Sword Coast. Yuan-ti threaten civilization in the Chultan

peninsula.  The  Shades  loom  over  Cormyr  and  the  Dalelands.

The People of the Black Blood conspire to murder travelers or

infect them with lycanthropy and turn them loose in large cities

where they can do the most harm. Phaerimms, mind  ayers, and

drow conspire and scheme in the Underdark, sometimes reaching

upward to crush the lives and spirits of people on the surface

world. Priestesses of Loviatar open roadside inns, then torture

to death anyone who accepts their hospitality.

The point is that real evil exists in Faern, meaning plenty of

work for true heroes to do. If players want to roleplay as valorous

heroes, there is no excuse not to give them the opportunity. While

not every adventure has to pit absolute good against absolute evil

THE VALOROUS HERO

or thwarting the machinations of yet another villain who wants

to rule all of Faern (after saving the world day after day, one

starts to wonder why it hasnt fallen apart due to some heros

failure), a valorous campaign should have regular episodes where

valor is the expected norm.

Valiant Hero

Archetypes

Its  easy  to   nd  archetypical  valorous  characters  for  each  of

the eleven standard classes in the Players Handbook. Though

many of the early archetypes can seem to be cliches, thats only

because these characters de ned the archetype, and the writers

who  followed  based  their  sample  heroes  on  these  archetypes.

Not every valiant hero has to be something new and unique in

the world; theres a place in the game for the simple courageous

paladin or thief with a heart of gold. The following characters

are archetypical examples of valiant heroes of their class.

Barbarian: The valorous barbarian archetype is the noble

savage, a man or woman from uncivilized lands who confronts

evil when he or she sees it, even though his or her actions might

be mocked or unappreciated by others. Robert E. Howards most

famous character, Conan, has remarkable prowess in battle and

instincts for survival; though hardly a man of virtue, Conan did

his share of battling evil wizards and horrible monsters when

such things needed to be done. Elements of the berserker aspect

of the barbarian class are common in Norse tales; the greatest

warriors slain in battle go to Valhalla to await Ragnarok when

their strength will be needed to  ght the frost giants at the end of

the world. The Celt hero C Chulainn is also a barbarian, though

while some consider him a bard because of his Celtic origins, he

was actually mighty warrior in battle, and his warp-spasm (rage)

physically transformed him into something strange and terrifying.

In Faern, the berserkers of Rashemen who pay for the freedom

of their land with blood spilled in battle with the Red Wizards

of Thay are sometimes valorous barbarians.

Bard: The D&D bard derives almost completely from the

Celtic  bards:  those  musicians  who  spread  wisdom,  recorded

knowledge and story in the form of song, and used their music

to blur the line between the natural and the supernatural. The

Greeks and Norse also had a strong bardic tradition, with the

Iliad,  the  Odyssey,  and  poetic  and  prose  eddas  passed  down

orally for generations by bards (thus, Homer and Snorri Stur-

luson should be considered bards). The in uence of Celtic bard

culture on the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting is clear: Oghma is

the Celtic god of bards, Silvanus is the Celtic god of nature,

and one of the most omnipresent good-aligned groups is the

Harpers. In Faern, the Harpers and the elves are common

sources of valorous bards.

Cleric  and  Druid:  Whether  serving  the  gods  or  nature

itself, priests are a staple of  ction and history. Friar Tuck was

a valorous priest, and though in most modern stories he plays

second  ddle to Robin Hood, he was Robins equal in sword and

bow. For a Biblical example, consider Moses; turning against his

adopted royal family, he risks death by taking up the cause of the

slave class, using divine magic to coerce and battle the enemies

of his people. Cathbad is a druid from the tales of C Chulainn,

father  of  a  king  and  speaker  of  the  prophecy  that  convinced

C Chulainn to take up arms and become a great hero. Faern

has many examples of valorous priests, Cadderly (the Chosen of

Deneir) being one of the most powerful.

Fighter:  Scotlands  William  Wallace  (Braveheart)  was  a

valorous  ghter; the son of a low knight, he united the clans of

his people to throw off the oppressive rule of a foreign leader,

came back from apparent death, and was captured and executed

for his actions. Col. Robert Gould Shaw (a real person upon whom

the movie Glory is based) is a more recent valorous  ghter; he

fought for the North in the Civil War because he believed in the

abolition of slavery, fought prejudice in his own army because

of those beliefs, and gave his life on the battle eld. The Purple

Dragons of Cormyr often produce valorous  ghters.

Monk: Unarmed combat has many styles, and dates back over

a thousand years. The 16th-century Chinese general and author

Qi Jiguang is a critically important martial artist; he taught his

soldiers  unarmed   ghting  techniques  and  mental  training  to

build courage, allowing them to defeat armored Japanese pirates

attacking the eastern provinces. Li Mu Bai in Crouching Tiger,

Hidden Dragon is a retired honorable martial artist who must

take up his sword again to stop a mysterious thief and the evil

woman who murdered his master. (Many characters from the

Jiang Hu mythical period of Chinese history would be valorous

monks in the D&D sense.) Members of several Faernian monk

orders (see page 25 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting)

are archetypal valorous monks.

Paladin:  The  valorous  paladin  archetype  primarily  comes

from the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round

Table, though some of these knights were less than perfect. Other

examples of the warrior chosen by the gods are Joan of Arc,

samurai in service to a good an honorable lord, and Hiawatha,

who spread peace and law among the Native American tribes,

facing  a  strange  snake-haired  wizard  and  eventually  founding

the Five Nations of the Iroquois. As members of the only D&D

standard class with a good alignment requirement, many paladins

are valorous characters. Valorous paladins are likely to appear in

any Faernian paladin order, though Torms and Tyrs followers

seem to be driven to valor.

Ranger:  Tolkiens  rangers,  particularly  Aragorn,  are  the

model for D&D rangerswoods-wise, sword-strong, and protect-

ing their fallen homeland from ancient evil as best they can (its

A valorous wizard confronts her darkest foes

telling to note that in previous editions of the game, rangers

had to be good). In more recent sources, Prince Gwydion of

Lloyd Alexanders Prydain Chronicles is clearly a noble ranger

(though as a secondary character he gets fewer pages than the

commoner protagonist), a leader of men, skilled in woods magic,

and brave in battle. Tarzan is another valorous ranger archetype;

though uncivilized, he lacks a barbarians battle lust, and his

love of nature and bond with animals mark him as a ranger.

Since the founding of the Silver Marches, that land has seen a

marked increase in the number of valorous rangers patrolling

its forests.

Rogue: Robin Hood, though born an aristocrat and trained

in war, is a good example of a valorous rogue; willing to risk

death to challenge a usurper to the throne, stealing from the

wealthy to give to the poor, and using trickery to defeat his

enemies and escape trouble. A more modern example is Indiana

Jones,  a  well-educated  man  who  unearths  long-lost  treasures

not to sell them, but to display them for all to see,  ghting

the Nazis and other evildoers in the process. Valorous rogues

can turn up almost anywhere in Faern,  ghting tyrants in

Westgate or on the Moonsea, working to destroy the evils of

Undermountain.

Sorcerer and Wizard: Again using Tolkiens writings as an

example, Gandalf is a valorous wizard. In the body of an old

man, a powerful spirit guides a team of heroes on a quest to save

the world, gives his own life to help them escape, and faces down

other evils to defend innocents. Harry Potter is a valorous wizard

even though he is just a boy when his quests begin; he faces the

lingering spirit of the man who killed his parents,  ghts horrible

monsters that would panic and devour an ordinary boy, and risks

himself to save his friends. Aglaronds many battles with Thay

have produced a disproportionate number of valorous sorcerers

in that country, and Waterdeeps place as the center of Faernian

trade and culture means that valorous wizards pass through its

gates almost daily.

The Imperfect

Champion of Good

Even among valorous heroes, nobody is perfect. Characters are

heroic because they overcome obstacles, whether those obstacles

are external or internal. Internal obstacles, or  aws, help de ne

a valorous character, and such a heros successful adventures set

an example to others that they shouldnt let their own failings

prevent them from doing great thingsovercoming ones own

shortfalls is a quest in itself.

A number of personality  aws are discussed below. An indi-

vidual hero might have one or more of these  aws to a greater

or lesser degree; each entry includes reasons why the hero might

act that way, and what races, nationalities, or faiths of heroes

THE VALOROUS HERO

might commonly have this  aw. When creating a valorous hero,

use these traits to help guide your character development but not

con ne it; as with alignment, these traits are a tool for  eshing

out a character, not stereotyping.

Bigoted: Bigoted heroes consider themselves better than an-

other group, race, nationality, profession, or religion. They might

feel this way because they were born in a culture of intolerance

and never had the opportunity to interact with members of the

inferior group, or because they see themselves as the cham-

pion of their position and dont have time to deal with lesser

concerns. Elves are often considered bigoted. Some long-lived

races consider humans arrogant if not bigoted in their sense of

superiority, and genasi think most other beings are less special

than the planetouched. As citizens of an ancient empire that still

stands to this day, the people of Mulhorand can be bigoted toward

foreigners,  as  can  Chessentans,  Sembians,  or  Waterdhavians,

who feel their city is the center of human trade and civilization.

Spellcasters look down on warriors for lacking brains and arcane

talent, and warriors curse spellcasters for their cowardly magic.

For a time shortly before the Godswar, the church of Torm in

Tantras persecuted unbelievers (members of other faiths) as

directed by its heretical high priest, which certainly is a form of

religious bigotry, as are the cross-elemental biases of Grumbar

and Akadi, or Kossuth and Istishia.

Brave: Brave heroes always try to appear fearless in the face

of danger. Some make a show of bravery to strengthen the hearts

of those around them; others do it to keep their inner fear from

breaking the surface and becoming known, while still others know

no fear because they are fools. Elves and dwarves are known for

their stoic bravery in the face of death. Hal ing heroes act brave

to bolster the common folk of their lands in times of danger.

Humans often use bravado in the same way as hal ings, but just

as often its a cover for the cold terror within. Cormyrs soldiers

are inspired to courage by their Purple Dragon Knights, while

heroes of Calimshan must look fearless in order to save face in

front of their family, servants, and slavesno matter what they

feel inside. The religions of Tempus, Tymora, and Tyr are three

faiths that greatly value courage.

Cautious:  Cautious  heroes  refuse  to  let  themselves  get  too

upset  or  too  enthusiastic  about  anything.  Such  a  hero  might

have acted rashly in the past to the detriment of others, or he

might fear that if he shows too much interest in vanquishing

something evil, spies might take note and go out of their way

to protect that thing. Some dwarves are cautious (except in the

face of immediate battle), remembering too many friends and

kin at home lost to a disastrous decision. Svirfneblin and drow

fear enemy spies (usually drow) who would use their actions to

 nd  the  location  of  their  home  city  or  the  identity  of  secret

allegiances. Citizens of Aglarond fear Thayan spies, Cormyreans

recall friends lost in foolish charges against the Devil Dragon,

and Sembians worry that showing too much interest can spoil a

deal or reveal a business contact better kept private. Remembering

the atrocities of Maztica, followers of Helm can be very cautious

in their actions. Many heroes serving good deities worry that

spending too much time at a particular church, town, or home

can draw their enemies attention to that place.

Fanatic: Fanatic heroes are willing to take on nearly impossible

odds at great risk to themselves if they think they can succeed.

Such a hero might be compensating for a past loss or failure to

act at the right time, or might be  a veteran of many battles,

with many lost friends over the years, and who now places little

value in his own life any longer. For many years, dwarves  t this

mindset, while their race seemed on the verge of extinction, but

the Thunder Blessing has changed this for most of them. Valor-

ous half-orcs can be fanatic in their attempts to prove to others

that they are truly heroes despite their orc heritage. Any nation

such  as  Cormyr,  Tethyr,  or  Unther  that  has  suffered  terrible

war losses in recent years is prone to have fanatic heroes. Many

paladins of Helm, Torm, and Tyr become fanatics in the hopes

of repaying various debts to the world for the Time of Troubles,

and old heroes of Tempus or the Red Knight may be ready to

leave Faern and join their deity in the afterlife, hoping to die

in battle rather than aged and in rmed in a bed.

Forgiving:  Forgiving  heroes  are  willing  to  overlook  past

slights, welcome old enemies as new friends, and accept that even

monsters can repent their evil ways and become good. Perhaps

they experienced prejudice in the past (whether for something

innate like their race, or perhaps because of an act they com-

mitted) or saw a friend turn to evil but crawl back to the light

again. Humans, even with their insatiable appetite for power, still

tend to be forgiving; the good-hearted gnomes and hal ings tend

to be as well. Aasimar and tie ings approach forgiveness from

opposite ends, but understand the need to accept those who are

different or who have turned away from darkness. Tethyrians and

Damarans have learned to put aside old hurts in the interest of

peace, and the people of Unther know that living under a tyrant

doesnt mean you enjoy tyranny. Ilmaters faith is best known

for its acceptance of old enemies and healing of old hurts; some

say Ilmater would forgive Loviatar herself if she repented her

cruelty. Followers of Helm understand that those who have done

wrong can regret their deeds, and in the long term, Silvanuss

worshipers are very tolerant of those who once hurt the forest

but now try to protect it.

Observant: Observant heroes are always on the lookout for

problems and frequently give suggestions and corrections to allies

and strangers. Perhaps they are forcing themselves to be vigilant

to make up for failing to notice the early signs of a great tragedy

or trying to prove themselves to a well-respected superior, ally, or

family member. Dwarves, elves, or deep gnomes might remember

a surprise attack on their community that occurred while they

THE VALOROUS HERO

were on duty. Members of every race are subject to hero worship

and  its  consequences.  Surviving  warriors  of  Untheric  border

towns might very well regret not mentioning the eastern dust

clouds that heralded the approaching Mulhorandi army, just as

Aglarondan border-watchers think back on every trick the Red

Wizards used to cross their border. Clerics of Torm wonder why

they didnt speak out against the offenses caused by their Tantran

high priest. Followers of Selne and Mystra wonder why it took

them so long to notice the existence of the Shadow Weave.

Overbearing:  Overbearing  heroes  are  vocal  about  their

quali cations and involvement. This behavior can be due to ar-

rogance, a desire to be in the spotlight, or a change from a meek

perspective. Elves and dwarves tend to be overbearing, especially

when younger, smaller, or weaker races are involved. Humans

have a gift for arrogance, remembering their races victories and

none of its many failures. Hal ing heroes often brag or boast

in order to make sure theyre noticed or to show theyre not just

jumped-up  farmers.  Calishites,  Sembians,  and  Thayan  wizards

tend to be overbearing, all believing they know how to handle a

situation the best. Followers of Tyr tend to assume they should

be in charge and act accordingly, and Lathanders faithful tend

to be exuberant, especially the recent converts.

Reserved: More than just exhibiting a tendency toward silence,

reserved heroes are usually content to go along with whatever the

group decides; they are reluctant to give their input, especially

when it contradicts the group leader or anyone of equal status.

Some quiet heroes do this because theyre agonizing over a past

mistake, while others save their input for the few topics they think

are really important. Hal ings are used to being overlooked, and

may remain quiet out of anger, letting it simmer until they reach

a point where they must speak their mind. Despite their frequent

jokes, many gnomes are actually quiet heroes, saving their strong

opinions for important discussions. Heroes of Tethyr often remain

silent because they understand what happens when a group turns

on itself due to con icting opinions, while Moonsea heroes still

remember the people killed for opposing the Zhentarim.

Reverent:  Reverent  heroes  are  very  common  among  the

faithful;  they  frequently  quote  scripture,  pray  at  every  shrine

and temple, and lecture others about their moral failings. Among

the lay folk, reverent heroes are meticulous about following the

law, unwilling to trespass on an enemys castle grounds without

announcing themselves. These heroes might have violated some

important religious or legal code and dont want it to happen

again, or might have recently found new faith or love of the

law  and  want  to  make  a  good  impression  among  like-minded

folk. Normally, this is a lawful-minded behavior. Humans are

the  most  likely  to  become  overzealous  in  this  regard,  though

drow living in exile often still cling to bits of religious doctrine

(such as never killing spiders, not looking women in the eye, and

so on). Uthgardt barbarians and half-orcs raised by orc tribes

often adhere to strict taboos of behavior for fear of offending

the spirits or bringing shame to their family. Grumbars faith is

meticulous in maintaining its ancient practices, and the lawful

Mulhorandi deities are similarly strict. Followers of the Triad

THE VALOROUS HERO

can annoy friends and strangers with frequent talk of morals,

laws, and following church directives.

Suspicious: Suspicious heroes scrutinize everyone, even their

friends and allies. Perhaps they are dealing with an unfamiliar

race  or  culture,  or  were  tricked  by  a  doppelganger  or  mind-

controlled ally, or fooled by a skilled enemy spy. Many dwarves

are suspicious by nature, as are drow raised in the Underdark.

Heroes of Amn and Calimshan are often suspicious given the

near omnipresence of thieves, spies, and assassins in their home-

lands. Selnes faithful can be suspicious of others despite their

general good nature, because Shar constantly plots to destroy

them. Many of Mystras followers have recently become more

suspicious of other spellcasters as rumors of the Shadow Weave

have become more prevalent.

Temperamental: Moody and often irritable, temperamental

heroes often have a shady past or a secret shame. Reluctant

heroes are often temperamental. Dwarves are often tempera-

mental because of concern over their home clans. Humans and

half-orcs can be moody because of old  aws or secrets. A hero

from  Hlondeth  might  worry  that  his  friends  will  learn  his

family is tainted with the blood of yuan-ti. A Thayan wizard

might brood over things he had to do as an apprentice to an

evil Red Wizard. A reluctant champion of Tymora, prodded

to  greatness  by  coincidence  and  circumstance,  might  regret

abandoning his family and worry about their welfare. Followers

of Kelemvor are taught that their god was a lycanthrope in his

mortal life, cursed to harm those he loved, so they understand

how  a  dark  secret  can  poison  the  laughter  in  an  otherwise

decent person.

Trusting: Trusting heroes can be trying to lull a suspected

enemy into a false sense of security, rebounding from a bout of

paranoid suspicion that got an innocent person hurt, or perhaps

are simply naive. Some drow heroes pretend to be trusting to see

if surface-dwellers intend to take advantage of them. People from

isolated communities often sincerely trust what others tell them,

no matter the source. Of all the Faernian deities, Eldath and

Lliira are the most likely to have extremely trusting followers,

con dent in their ethos that the world is a safe place.

How Do You Atone?

Sometimes a  awed hero stumbles, and sometimes that stumble

causes  a  fall.  Fortunately,  most  good  societies  understand  the

concepts  of  penance,  forgiveness,  and  redemption;  a  valorous

game without these concepts becomes a game of attrition, as one

by one the heroes fail and cannot continue.

USING THE ATONEMENT SPELL

When  a  hero  falls  morally,  that  hero  can  avail  himself  of  a

chance to prove himself over again to those who have come to

doubt his commitment, strength, and ability. In stories, these

are usually special tasks, quests, or rituals. In the D&D game,

the obvious method is the atonement spell, which could require

some sort of quest. However, it is important to note that the

atonement  spell  isnt  always  required.  A  suitably  remorseful

hero  can  atone  for  a  misdeed  without  the  intervention  of  a

spellcasting priest; there is nothing particularly special about

a 9th-level spellcasters ability to forgive transgressions other

than his access to the spell, and a lower-level priest could use the

spell from a scroll or a wand, so clearly the priest and the spell

arent the key factors. The D&D game simpli es many things

for Dungeon Masters who dont have the time or inclination to

require extended roleplaying for a characters penance, and the

atonement spell serves that purpose.

In campaigns where magic is more than what spells you have

prepared and faith is more than what deity is written on your

character sheet, any sincerely penitent person should be able to

atone for a transgression on his own through appropriate acts.

Whether this act is a self-imposed exile in the desert for a year

or a divinely inspired task that carries great risk, in a world where

the gods walked in mortal form less than a generation ago, those

gods and nameless powers of good can recognize sincere atonement

whether or not a priest is there to cast a spell. Of course, many

strict religions still require the spell even after a true atonement,

just to make it of cial in the church records, but other than

ostracism from the church, a hero who truly absolves his sins

needs no other proof of it than what lies in his own heart.

That said, in many cases a hero wants the atonement spell

not because he wants a shortcut, but because he wants or needs

some sort of of cial recognition that his transgression is forgiven.

A righteous paladin of Torm who is dominated by a vampire

and terrorizes a town for a month wants to make sure that not

only does his church believe he is worthy of absolution, but the

townsfolk  know  that  the  church  believes  this  (and  hopefully

the  paladin  has  made  reparations  to  the  town  as  part  of  his

atonement).

THE ACT OF ATONING

A sin or other spiritual failure is really a kind of debt, whether

a debt to a deity, an oath, or ones principleswhether or not

the act was intentional. The goddess Hera once drove Heracles

temporarily insane, and while so mad he killed his own children;

as penance for the crime against his family, he served ten years

as a slave of his cousin Eurystheus (Silvanus might do this to

a hero who destroys a natural treasure or kills a rare animal).

These acts of penance are a metaphysical coin for paying the

heros debt.

Atoning is a ritualistic or spiritual way to repay that debt,

usually in a way related to the offense. A hero who deliberately

kills an innocent man could be directed to raise the orphans as

13

8/31/05   3:17:15 PM

THE VALOROUS HERO

his own children; a hero who offends a goddess might have to

build her a temple with his own hands. Having the quest suit

the  nature  of  the  failure  is  thematically  stronger  than  (for

example) a quest to kill a monster that has nothing to do with

the failure, and players are more likely to remember the stories

of their heroes adventures if their punishment  ts the crime.

Fortunately, Faern has many evil cults, guilds, and monsters

that are suitable for such quests, and dozens of ancient items of

powers to be restored to the proper handsin other words, many

currencies useful for paying metaphysical debt.

Of course, many times heroes gain great fame for performing

their atonement quests, relegating their misdeeds into compara-

tive obscurity. For example, the Twelve Labors of Heracles were

actually dictated to him by Eurystheus as part of his punish-

ment, but few remember that, focusing on the Twelve Labors

as acts of heroism destined for a hero to accomplish. The gods

(and other agents of atonement) are aware of this and can decide

that a more humbling or debilitating punishment is in order.

When Hera drove Heracles mad at a later time and again caused

him to strike down his children, Zeus made him the slave of a

Greek queen, forced to wear womens clothes and sew for a year.

In  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  high-magic  setting,  even  stranger

punishments are possible. A paladin of Ilmater who rebuffs a

frightened old mans request for help might be tasked to take

on the  oggings of an entire prison full of murderers; a greedy

priest of Chauntea who  lls her belly while her constituents go

hungry might be required to live on bread and water for a year,

using her skill and spells to provide food for a village during

that time. Heroes who commit horrible acts can be banished to

one of the Nine Hells to be tortured by devils for a month, or

imprisoned on the Plane of Shadow for a like amount of time,

surrounded by half-real illusions of the victims of their acts. These

tasks absolve the heroes failings without rewarding them with

fame in the process. Valorous heroes who are repeat offenders

should get successively more dif cult quests or tasks to atone for

their failings.

Atonement should always cost the hero something signi cant.

Sometimes the cost is a risk, as when he is sent to  ght a horrible

monster. Sometimes its the heros time, as with the temple-build-

ing example. Rarely is the cost simply money, since the D&D

treasure system expects that heroes have a certain amount of

wealth at each character level, and even large amounts of donated

treasure  are  usually  just  a  temporary  setback.  In  a  few  cases

(particularly with lawful individuals) the omission of action is

the cost; heroes can be required to swear oaths to abstain from

certain things (sex, particular foods, and so on) or certain acts

(cursing, talk to nonbelievers, and so on). Of course, after multiple

failings a hero might be so constrained by his oaths that he can

hardly take action without careful consideration beforehand to

make sure he doesnt break his word.

Vengeance versus Compassion

Vengeance in Faern is an interesting subject. Many stories talk

of heroic vengeance, but gaining revenge often comes at a great

cost  in  life,  magic,  or  damage  to  the  land.  Its  interesting  to

examine vengeance from a divine perspective as well. Horus-Re

is a god of vengeance and is good, but Hoar and Shevarash are

both  neutral  (and  Shevarashs  vengeance  is  only  against  evil

drow,  not  indiscriminate  vengeance)  and  Kiaransalee  is  evil.

Clearly, according to the gods revenge has its place and can be

done in the name of good, but it is just as likely to originate in

evil or be divorced from good and evil entirely. This is a lesson

to valorous characters who tread the path of revenge, and should

be a caution to them. Are their motivations good, or less pure?

What are the consequences of this vengeance? Is there a more

constructive way to right the wrongs you are avenging? Is the

target of your vengeance redeemable, or so vile that the world

is better off with it dead?

That last point is especially important. Book of Exalted Deeds

talks about mercy and forgiveness as key elements of a truly good

character. Extending mercy to a defeated opponent is something

an evil character would never do, nor would an evil opponent truly

forgive someone who wronged him, and as such those two acts

de ne what is good behavior (the willingness to do something no

evil creature would consider the right response). Again, looking

at the deities, Ilmater is a powerful deity who embodies persever-

ance and suffering; he more than any other knows what horrors

evil can perform, but he endures by holding onto the hope that

eventually evil hearts will turn to good, or, if need be, destroyed

outright. While he is allied with Torm, a martial god of paladins,

Ilmaters superior is Tyr, god of justice, and part of true justice

is knowing when a punishment is appropriate or excessive and

when clemency is merited. In a world where truly evil gods walk

the earth, the leader of the Harpers makes a peace agreement

with the Zhentarim, and one of the lands most famous heroes is

a good-aligned dark elf, the desire to slay an enemy for revenge

must always be questioned.

Kill or Capture?

Good characters throughout Toril face the same dilemma that

good characters elsewhere deal with: What to do with captured

enemies? In a world where magic is much more common, deal-

ing with captives can be much easier, especially with the use of

portals, teleport spells, and other magic that lets you transport

many creatures to other locations in a short period of time.

Adventurers are common enough that most places have laws

specifying what adventurers can and cannot do (Cormyr requires

them to register, for example, making it easier to identify and

track adventurers who take the law into their own hands), and

8/31/05   3:17:19 PM

THE VALOROUS HERO

good-aligned  adventurers  should  not  feel  they  can  disregard

local laws just because theyre out of earshot of a town. Most

countries have laws about killing prisoners without a trial or at

least make arrangements to ransom them back to their comrades

in the hope that enemies will respect a similar agreementso

heroes who put captured opponents to the sword are little better

than common murderers. Good heroes should prepare for the

necessity of binding subdued opponents or be willing to let their

captives go free with a promise of better behavior (and prob-

ably stripped of their weapons and armor so they cant easily

harm other people). Of course, it is a different situation when

the heroes are acting as agents of the lawkilling a wanted

murderer in open combat is completely legal, for examplebut

even those acting with approval of the law must obey these

same laws; a Waterdhavian priest of Tyr acting under orders

of his temple to root out a thieves guild should try to capture

some of the thieves if possible so they can be questioned, tried,

and sentenced.

Character against

Character

In a world where the gods of death are neutral and lawful good

gods are a minority, alignment con ict (and thus philosophical

con ict) between characters occurs frequently. To a good character

with neutral or evil friends, this con ict can be very frustrating,

since he wants his friends to be the best they can be and doesnt

want to compromise his own principles, but usually knows that

morality lectures do little good. The good-aligned character in

such  a  group  should  consider  a  different  way  of  showing  his

friends the bene ts of being good, such as by offering the good

option in practical rather than moral terms. If the others in

the  group  agree  to  the  good  characters  choice,  he  can  later

explain his moral reasons for the choice and how they support

the practical reasons.

Example:  A  good  moon  elf  and  his  dwarf  and  human

companions have just dealt with the warriors of a small tribe

of Stonelands goblins raiding Cormyr farms. The dwarves and

humans want to kill the females and young because they believe

goblins  are  incurably  evil,  and  if  they  are  left  alive  theyll

just want revenge on the Cormyreans for their dead husbands

and fathers. The moon elf points out that killing them just

means that some other evil group is going to take over their

territory and be a problem for the farmers later. He suggests

leaving them alive with some of their treasure and weapons,

arranging  to  have  a  team  of  Chauntean  priests  teach  them

rudimentary agriculture appropriate for the area, and hoping

that they change their ways in the future, since perhaps the

raiding goblins were evil out of starvation or worship of evil

gods. If his allies accept this proposal (perhaps after suggesting

that the treasure left behind comes out of the elfs share), the

elf can later explain why he feels killing defenseless creatures,

even evil ones, is wrong, because killing an evil creature just

sends another soul to an evil deity, while giving it a chance to

redeem itself not only steals a soul from the evil gods, it sends

it to the good gods.

Another more risky method is to speak out against less

moral choices the other characters make and point out when

their poor choices come back to haunt them. Of course, a good

character shouldnt allow his friends to commit evil acts, but

he might choose to stand idly by during some minor infrac-

tions,  so  this  is  risky  behavior.  A  crafty  good  character  or

one with a lot of contacts and resources even has the option

of cleaning up the messes his allies make, then confront-

ing  them  with  their  mistakes  and  showing  how  his  actions

prevented  serious  repercussions.  Unfortunately,  the  good

character tends to come across as incredibly arrogant when

doing this, so sometimes it is best to only deal with major

problems, letting the minor things come back to haunt the

allies. When they grow annoyed with the damage caused by

these old problems, the good-aligned character can point out

that hes been  xing things as best as he can but he cant  x

everything,  and  if  they  tried  harder  to  make  good  choices

they wouldnt be suffering so. This option requires a strong

roleplayer willing to spend time alone with the DM negotiating

resolutions to the partys blunders.

Good versus Good:

When Beliefs Collide

Just as its possible for an adventuring party to have con icts be-

tween good and nongood characters, a party of differently aligned

good characters can disagree on moral issues. On a larger scale,

two good churches or even countries can come into con ict about

differing concepts of good. It is remarkable that in a world with

actual, tangible evil, two different good characters or countries

are willing to engage in bloody con ict about whose interpretation

of good is correct, but it is the nature of humanoids to come to

blows when even small disagreements get heated.

Law versus Chaos

This form of con ict is a surprise to no one; independence and

personal freedom opposed by obedience and duty. Chaotic good

characters feel restricted by the rules of lawful characters, and

lawful characters feel that chaotic characters have no discipline

or  respect  for  order.  Followers  of  Tymora  think  that  Torms

worshipers are too stiff, and Tyrs faithful wish the church of

THE VALOROUS HERO

Selne would get organized and  ght evil in an effective, sys-

tematic manner. As the Players Handbook states, lawful good is

the best alignment because it combines honor and compassion,

while chaotic good is the best alignment because it combines a

good heart with a free spirit. These ideas are not incompatible,

and  wise  members  of  both  alignments  need  to  be  willing  to

agree to disagree.

Neutral versus Others

Those who can afford the luxury of debating the merits of dif-

ferent kinds of good sometimes say that neutral good (true good)

is the best kind of good because it focuses on doing good without

worrying about chaos or law. They say that if the combinations

of law, chaos, good, and evil were drawn on a great wheel, neutral

good  would  occupy  the  highest  position  on  the  wheel,  higher

(relative to the ground) than either lawful good or chaotic good,

proving that indifference to law and chaos allows a person to

do more good in the world. Whether this is true or the proof is

even valid, neutral good heroes sometimes face criticism from

both law and chaos.

Lawful characters see a neutral good hero as falling short of

her full potential, while chaotic characters think the neutral good

character is willing to sacri ce a few too many personal freedoms

in the name of greater good. Neutral good characters can see the

merits of both sides of the law-versus-chaos argument and use

these points to counter whoever criticizes their moral choices.

Chaunteas followers understand that supporting the prosperity

of a community is often more important than following all the

rules of a sovereign settlement, but they know that without some

kind of structure and agreement

to aid each other, smaller com-

munities might fall apart.

Law versus Law

Much like how the different branches of Christianity disagree

on what is the true religion and what acts are necessary to

be accepted in the eyes of the divine, different lawful churches,

organizations, or governments can disagree on interpretations of

good. In Faern, most of the lawful good churches are closely

allied by race or region (the Triad for the Faernian humans,

Horus-Re and Osiris for the Mulhorandi humans, the dwarf pan-

theon for the Stout Folk, the gnome pantheon for the Forgotten

Folk, and the hal ing pantheon for the hin) and dont come into

con ict about doctrine because they have few interactions outside

of world-spanning evil threats. Even followers of rogue lawful

good entities such as Nobanion are so isolated and specialized in

their areas of concern that they seldom meet other lawful good

creatures of radically different perspectives.

The countries that have a signi cant lawful good presence in

their citizens and governmentCormyr, some of the Dalelands,

the  Great  Rift,  Halruaa,  Impiltur,  Luiren,  Mulhorand,  the

Silver Marches, and Tethyrare so geographically scattered that

only two of them share a common border, and therefore open

con icts are rare at best. For example, it is hard to imagine that

Tethyr and the Silver Marches could ever disagree so strongly

as to declare each other enemies, and the logistics of  ghting a

war between those two countries would be impossible without

the use of magic that could be put to better use defending those

countries against immediate threats.

Chaos versus Chaos

Chaotic  good  characters  are  generally

less concerned with what other people

think about them than what they think

about themselves. This is not to say that theyre egomaniacs, it

just means that a chaotic good adventurer doesnt care if the

local priest thinks hes too independent and rebellioushes more

concerned with doing good in the world than obeying some stuffy

old church laws, and this applies whether the priest is lawful or

chaotic. Chaotic good churches and groups are usually focused on

their own agendas and dont fret about other chaotic good entities

as long as they dont get in the way of that agenda.

For example, it unlikely youd ever  nd a priestess of Selne

arguing with a Lliiran bard about who is doing more good in

the world. The priestess isnt going to demand that the bard stop

dancing and help her  ght a werewolf any more than the bard

is going to insist that the priestess ignore the lycanthrope threat

to deal with a local lord who has banned dancing as immoral.

They could ask each other for help in their tasks, but (except in

extreme cases) neither feels that his or her side is superior or that

the opposing side is immoral. Likewise, you wont see a follower

of Sharess and one of Sune start a  ght about whether love or

pleasure is more important (though such a  ght would undoubt-

ably attract a crowd). Being chaotic good is about recognizing

that you cant have one set of rules that applies to everyone, each

person has to be able to make his own choices about how to be

good, and others should respect those choices.

Races from Other

Supplements

Recent  D&D  supplements  have  introduced  three  new  races:

the goliaths (Races of Stone), illumians (Races of Destiny), and

raptorans (Races of the Wild). If you have these books and want

to include these new races in your FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign,

here are some suggestions for where in Faern these races might

call home and ways to introduce them to Faern as a new race.

Goliaths

These stony humanoids prefer mountains; if you want them to

already exist in Faern, consider placing them in the Azirrhat

or other northern mountains of Anauroch, where they compete

with the asabi for resources. The goliaths could live in Chult,

unseen by the lowland peoples because of the rock-folks love for

the high places. Their attitude and tribal nature is compatible with

the followers of Uthgar, and while the cold climate of the Spine

of the World doesnt suit their tendency to wear little clothing,

perhaps they come from a volcanically warmed hidden valley

amid the frosty peaks. If you want the goliaths to be a relatively

new race, they could be a cross between earth genasi and stone

giants, creatures brought to Faern by Grumbar from another

Material Plane to  ght Akadis in uence, another Thayan failed

experiment in creating a servitor race, a creation by the sharns

or phaerimms in their long war, or humans newly altered by

wizards of Halruaa to deal with the monsters on the outer face

of the mountains that ring that land. Goliaths have a friendly

rivalry with earth genasi and enjoy commenting on the smaller

stature of their cousins.

Illumians

This race is made up of humans transformed by magic. If the

illumians in your campaign are an established race rather than

new arrivals, the archmage-ruled island of Nimbral is an ideal

place for them. Nimbrals illumians might populate much of the

island or live in only one part, a naturally magical faction among

the  Nimbral  Lords.  The  illumians  could  also  be  an  offshoot

of the shades of old Netheril, bearing shadow sigils instead of

lights. Perhaps a brilliant Red Wizard has discovered the Ritual

of Words Made Flesh, transformed herself and her apprentices

to  increase  her  own  power,  then   ed  Thay  before  her  rivals

discovered her advantage; they now hold their cabal in a secret

place in Murghm or the Hordelands. A Halruaan could have

discovered the Ritual and was banished for using it on others

without permission of the Council of Elders, and now he and

his followers are scattered across southern Faern searching for a

place to call their own. Most illumians in Faern worship Azuth,

Deneir, or Mystra, though given their obsession with mastering

situations some choose to follow the Red Knight.

Raptorans

These  winged  humanoids  favor  the  same  sort  of  terrain  as

aarakocras.  In  a  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign,  perhaps  the

aarakocras made a pact with Akadi, transforming themselves into

raptorans and gaining increased fertility (similar to Moradins

Thunder Blessing) in exchange for service to the Lady of the

Winds.  In  this  situation,  the  raptorans  would  control  one  or

more of the three current aarakocra aeries (the Storm Horns in

Cormyr, the Cloven Mountains on the Vilhon Reach, and the

Mistcliffs in Chult). Alternately, Akadi could have transported

a raptoran  ock from another plane to Faern, calling on them

to obey their pact with the air elementals to help her combat the

forces of Grumbar; these raptorans might live in the Wyrmbones

(mountains southwest of Shar) due to this ranges proximity to the

Mound of the First Shrine, an Akadian holy site in the ruins of

Blaskaltar. Finally, if the aarakocras hail from Maztica, perhaps

the raptorans do, too, and a contingent of them have arrived

in western Faern (either in ships or a long albatrosslike  ight

across the Trackless Sea) to continue an old feud with or pay a

debt to the other birdfolk. These raptorans might worship Akadi

or Eha, the Maztican god of air.

Valorous

Racial

Archetypes

While  many  of  the  nonhuman  PC

races tend toward a good alignment,

there is a difference between play-

ing a good character and playing

a  valorous  character.  Here  are

examples of valorous archetypes of

each race in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting as well as goliaths,

illumians,  and  raptorans  if  youre

using them in Faern.

The  Valorous  Dwarf:  Mountain

dwarves  and  hill  dwarves  tend

toward good alignments, and valor-

ous dwarves are the ones dwarf bards

sing  about  for  generations.  Valorous

dwarves are the greatest

champions of their com-

munities, single-handedly

hunting  down  the   eeing

members  of  enemy  raiding  par-

ties  if  necessary.  Given  the

relative security of the

Great Rift compared

to  the  many  declin-

ing shield dwarf communities

(only  reversed  in  this  past

generation  by  the  Thun-

der  Blessing),  gold

dwarves are less likely

to  become  valorous

heroes  than  shield

dwarves,  perhaps  because

there is less of a need for them.

Valorous  duergar  are  exceed-

ingly  rare;  the  dreary  life  of  most

duergar quickly extinguishes the

spark of nobility and self-sacri-

 ce among the gray dwarves,

and those who resist enough

to  remain  good  in  their

hearts often barely have

the strength to escape,

THE VALOROUS HERO

From top down:

the valorous raptoran,

goliath, and illumian

let  alone  champion  any

valorous cause.

The Valorous Elf: Each

of  the  many  races  of  elves

achieves valor in its own way.

Sun elves are most often the

exalted  heroes  of  the  elf  race,

clearing the path to Evermeet,

holding  the  line  so  that  others

make  it  safely  to  the  Elven

Court,  and  obliterating  any

evil that threatens the elves that

remain in Faern. The moon elves

are  usually  the  protectors  of  the

things elves love in the worldthings

that  convinced  them  to  ignore  the

Retreat.  Valorous  moon  elves  are  the

most  accepting  of  other  races,  forging

friendships  with  valorous  humans  and

dwarves, uniting against evils that would

harm  indiscrimi-

nately. Wild elves,

wood  elves,  and

aquatic  elves  are  generally

too  reclusive  to  take  up  the  mantle

of  great  valor,  content  to  live  in

their hidden communities safe from

most  large-scale  danger.  Like

gray dwarves, few drow have the

potential  to  become  valorous

and even fewer ever meet that

potential, though some would

say  that  Drizzt  DoUrden

is  an  example  of  a  valorous

dark elf.

The  Valorous  Gnome:

Gnomes  are  much  like

dwarves  in  that  their  most

valorous  heroes  often  never

appear on the surface world,

so intent are they on smashing

the enemies of the Forgot-

ten Folk. Rock gnomes are

more likely to be valorous

heroes than other gnomes,

since  svirfneblin  and  forest

gnomes generally tend not to be risk-takers

willing to make heroic sacri ces.

THE VALOROUS HERO

The Valorous Goliath: The goliaths tend toward good overall,

and their competitive and daring nature means that many good

goliaths  aspire  to  valorous  heroics.  Ironically,  goliaths  are  so

competitive that if one member of a tribe becomes a valorous

hero, others in the tribe often try to outdo their rivals great

deeds, leading folk living nearby to assume that all goliaths are

overly brave paragons of good.

The Valorous Half-Elf: Because most half-elves are descended

from moon elves, it is not surprising that most valorous half-

elves blend the tendencies of valorous humans and moon elves,

taking their valor to an extreme and watching over places that

call to the elven heart. Good half-drow, like good half-orcs, often

throw themselves zealously into valorous quests, as if to prove

that they are individuals and not slaves to the evil tendencies of

their nonhuman ancestors.

The Valorous Hal ing: Because most strongheart hal  ings

live  in  Luiren,  many  assume  theyre  homebodies,  but  the

stronghearts have a strong warrior tradition, and many valorous

strongheart hal ings have distinguished themselves in various

battles  defending  their  homeland  from  horrible  monsters.

Lightfoot  hal ings  often  have  extended  families  stretching

across  multiple  frontiers,  and  as  such  theyre  more  likely  to

hear about evil and injustice and take action to defend their

loved ones against desperate odds. Ghostwise hal ings are the

least likely to become valorous heroes because their nature and

culture doesnt reward attracting attention, though those who

answer the call tend to become great liberators of oppressed

peoplehal ing or otherwise.

The Valorous Half-Orc: Half-orcs are viewed with scorn and

derision in most of Faern, and half-orc heroes are uncommon.

Valorous half-orcs are not unheard of, however, and a signi cant

number of truly good half-orcs are valorous, either to prove they

are not crude orc-spawn or to atone for evils caused by their orc

(or human) ancestors. Thesks population of settled Zhentarim

orcs has mixed well with the locals, and their community is the

home of at least one valorous half-orc.

The Valorous Human: Some would argue that humans have

the greatest potential of all the races of Faernthe greatest

good  and  the  greatest  evil.  Proponents  of  humanity  point  to

Cormyr, Waterdeep, and Mulhorand as examples of the accom-

plishments of human civilization; those critical of humanity point

to Netheril, Thay, and Zhentil Keep as humanity corrupted by

power. Seemingly ignorant of the debates, humanity continues

to  spit  out  valorous  heroes  all  over  the  world,  toppling  petty

dictators, slaying marauding dragons, and even saving the world

and ascending to godhood.

The Valorous Illumian: Valorous illumians are great strate-

gists, planning far ahead and trying to anticipate their opponents

next  moves.  Because  they  enjoy  showing  their  mastery  over

others, illumians have no dif culty accepting an enemys sur-

render (an appropriate act for a valorous person). Because they

constantly analyze social structures, valorous illumians are often

the  rst to realize that something is amiss in an organization

that is secretly corrupt.

The  Valorous  Planetouched:  Aasimar,  like  paladins,  are

naturally drawn to valorous behavior, and a steady trickle of

part-celestial heroes comes from Mulhorand, where that race

is much more common. The genasi do not often become valor-

ous because their self-centered tendencies and af nity for the

neutral elements makes it dif cult for them to take the big step

and act for the greater good. Tie ings have the same problem

as half-orcs and drow: Theyre perceived as inherently evil and

have to work twice as hard just to be accepted. A few driven

tie ings can become valorous heroes, though they always worry

about temptation and corruption.

The Valorous Raptoran: These winged humanoids train all

their offspring to the maximum of their potential, which means

a surprising number of raptorans turn out to be valorous rather

than just good. The main obstacle to raptorans becoming valorous

is their aggressive nature in combat, which makes mercy a rarely

considered option.

This  chapter  provides  scores  of  new  character

options  for  players  to  explore.  DMs  will  also

 nd the material in this chapter useful when

building NPCs. Players should check with their DMs before using

the material in this chapter; as always, the DM has the  nal say

when it comes to deciding whats allowed and whats not allowed

in his or her campaign.

Regional Backgrounds

Regions in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting are typically associated

with large geographic areas or at least some locale as large as

a city. This book expands that concept by presenting regional

backgrounds that function in conjunction with a region. These

backgrounds represent character origins or upbringings and are

typically tied to a particular area, organization, or belief, such as

a monastery, temple, druid circle, Harper safe house, or bardic

college. Some of these backgrounds are speci c to one region,

while others have multiple sites separated by miles and country

borders. For example, the Orphan of the Yellow Rose regional

background is one small place in a Damaran mountain range,

while the Ward of the Triad regional background consists of a

dozen small pockets across several countries that favor Ilmater,

Torm, and Tyr. All of the regional backgrounds described in this

book are tied to good in some way.

A  character  who  chooses  a  regional  background  uses  it  in

place of a region for determining his automatic languages, bonus

languages, favored deities, regional feats, and bonus equipment.

Effectively, the background replaces the characters region for

all of these listings. However, for the purpose of meeting any

other prerequisites (other than regional feats), use the characters

actual region rather than his regional background. For example,

a character who chooses the Dalelands as his region and Bastard

of Azoun as his regional background quali es for prestige classes

and the like using the Dalelands region. Also, you cant purchase

skill ranks in Knowledge (local) for a regional background. Use

only actual regions for this purpose.

A regional background is chosen during character creation

at the same time that the player chooses a region. The regional

background chosen must have the characters region listed as an

option. For example, the Holy Realm regional background has

Dragon Coast or Turmish as associated regions, which means that

only characters who choose one of those two regions can select

Holy Realm as a regional background.

Some of these regional backgrounds are very general (such

as  celestial-attended  birth),  and  you  can  use  them  for  many

different  faiths  or  organizations.  Others  are  speci c  to  one

region (such as Mulhorandi royal) or speci c to a particular

good in uence (such as ward of the Triad) and therefore more

focused in their interests and rewards. Feel free to use these

general  and  speci c  examples  to  create  your  own  new  good

regional backgrounds.

Bardic Tutelage

Bards  are  highly  respected  in  Faern  (mainly  because  of  the

actions of the Harpers) and bardic colleges are praised not only

for the musical talents of their graduates but their traditions of

magic and worldly knowledge. Wealthy folk pay to have their

children taught by bards, and traveling bards sometimes spon-

sor  enterprising  young  students.  These  people  are  taught  the

history  of  music  and  lore  and  their  roles  in  shaping  civilized

society. Graduates of good-aligned bardic colleges see themselves

Regional Feats: Arcane Schooling (bard), Artist, Education

Bonus Equipment: (A) masterwork instrument, chain shirt,

and 50 gp; or (B) masterwork chainmail; or (C) two scrolls of

cats grace.

Bastard of Azoun

King Azoun IV was neither the most faithful husband nor par-

ticularly discreet in his affairs, and in the thirty-odd years of his

rule he fathered quite a few royal bastards. These offspring mainly

live in Cormyr and the nearby lands, but due to far-traveling

diplomats and other of cials, a few are scattered all over Faern.

Most are born into families of privilege, but even those of lower

status usually received some kind of stipend to avoid complaints

and public embarrassment. Whether or not these children ever

try to make claims based on their bloodline, they are Azouns

heirs in courage and attitude.

Region: Dalelands, Impiltur, Sembia, Silver Marches, Water-

deep, Western Heartlands.

Automatic Languages: As region.

Bonus Languages: As region.

Favored Deities: As region.

Regional Feats: Bullheaded, Dreadful Wrath, Fearless, Luck

of Heroes.

Bonus Equipment: (A) masterwork longsword; or (B) chain-

mail and 25 masterwork arrows or bolts; or (C) two 2nd-level

scrolls.

Celestial-Attended Birth

Some people are born to do great things, and the easiest way to

recognize this is if a celestial arrives to announce or witness your

birth. With dozens of good-aligned deities watching over mortal

affairs and thousands of births every day, a celestial visitation at

childbirth can happen once per yearoften enough to be remark-

able to those involved, but common enough to those aware of the

supernatural to not get obsessive about their attention. Followers

of  the  celestials  deity  (and  in  rare  cases,  the  actual  celestial)

observe the children of these blessed births and try to give them

proper spiritual guidance when the time is right. Sometimes these

mentors go too far in their teachings and damage the childs

potential, but in most cases the child grows up to be a special

young man or womanspecial enough to be an adventurer, for

examplewith unusual talents.

Region: Any.

Bonus  Equipment:  (A)  masterwork  longsword,  masterwork

mace, or masterwork short sword; or (B) masterwork chainmail;

or (C) faith token (see page 64) of any good deity.

Child of the Unicorn

Many  tales  tell  of  the  man-child  raised  by  animalsa  feral,

confused  creature  with  no  language  or  higher  thought.  A

fortunate  few  children  like  these  are  found  by  good  monsters

or good talking beasts rather than common animals, raised in

nature like the wild-children but taught to speak and enriched by

intelligent interaction. Called children of the unicorn because

their  nonhumanoid  friends  often  worship  the  goddess  Lurue,

they can interact with normal humans and lead normal lives,

or  even  live  as  adventurers.  Heroes  of  this  region  tend  to  be

stubborn and swift.

Region: The High Forest, The North, Silverymoon

Automatic Languages: None.

Bonus Languages: As region, plus Sylvan.

orc bane arrow; or (B) potion of easy trailMag; or (C) masterwork

longsword.

Chosen-Born

The gods invest a handful of mortals with fantastic power to

carry out their demands in Faern. Some of these Chosen have

families  and  the  godly  magic  inadvertently  gets  passed  on  to

their offspring. These children often grow up to be great heroes

in their own right. Nobody knows how numerous the Chosen-

born are; some particularly long-lived Chosen (such as Alustriel)

could have dozens of grandchildren, any number of which might

be exceptional.

Region: Any (as appropriate for the deity).

Automatic Languages: As region.

Church Acolyte

Thousands of young adults join good churches all over Faern

every day with the hope of becoming clerics. Some  nd its too

hard or not to their liking, and leave after absorbing only some

elements of the churchs teachings. Some  nd other roles in the

church more exciting or rewarding. More than just a choice of

patron deity, these devotees of a faith identify more strongly with

their church than they do with their home country.

Region: Any region with a signi cantly large good temple.

Automatic Languages: As region.

Bonus Languages: As region, plus Celestial.

Favored Deities: Any good deity.

Regional  Feats:  Bullheaded,

Cosmopolitan, Education.

Bonus Equipment:

(A) masterwork  ail,

masterwork mace, or

masterwork morning-

star; or (B) masterwork

chainmail;  or  (C)  six  po-

tions of cure light wounds.

Circle-Born

Most  of  the  nature  deities  in

Faern accept good druids, and

their druid circles revere the

positive and nurturing aspects

of  the  natural  world.  Children

raised  in  these  circles  understand  life  in  the

wilderness  and  (if  close  enough  to  a  larger

settlement) are accustomed to civilization, often

becoming  liaisons  between  their  families  and  the  humanoid

interests that want to encroach on nature.

Region: Any with a signi cant druid presence.

Automatic Languages: As region.

Bonus Languages: As region, plus Sylvan.

Favored Deities: Any nature deity.

Regional Feats: Bullheaded, Forester, Survivor.

Bonus  Equipment:  (A)  masterwork  druid  weapon;  or  (B)

masterwork heavy darkwood shield; or (C) masterwork leather

armor and wand of delay poisonMag (9 charges).

Enlightened Student

Just as there are bardic colleges run by good and valorous folk,

there  are  schools  and  universities  concerned  with  educating

students about right and wrong in addition to who did what and

when. Some of these institutes of learning are wizard colleges, but

many are just places where gifted students go to learn and rich

people send their children to get them out of the house. Many

graduates go on to become leaders in their home communities or

adventurers that help bridge the gap between warring races.

Region: Calimshan, Cormyr, Evermeet, Impiltur, Mulhorand,

Sembia, Silver Marches, Waterdeep.

Automatic Languages: As region.

Bonus  Languages:  As  region  plus  any  one  (including  dead

join the Harpers, but

many of them become

adventurers with material

interests in mind or just a wan-

derlust born of the incredible bedtime stories

their  mother  or  father  told  them  in  their

younger years. Sometimes a Harper goes deep

undercover in enemy territory, raising a family

there to preserve their cover identity, and when the child learns

Knight Squire

Dozens of good knighthoods keep watch over parts of Faern.

Many parents see knighthood as a way for their child to gain

status, either as a way to escape a lifetime of farm work or as a

way to prove service to the nobility. Though few of these children

grow up to be knights, they gain rare opportunities, spending

time with majestic horses and heroes.

Martyrs Progeny

When  Torm  battled  Bane  during  the  Time  of  Troubles,  he

absorbed the souls of many of his worshipers to  ght the more

powerful deity. When he was restored to life after the Godswar

those  worshipers  remained  dead  and  his  temples  adopted  the

orphans of the battle. Some were too young to remember their

parents and embraced the church with great vigor, some resent

Torm for causing the death of their parents and only grudgingly

accepted their tutelage long enough to  gure out where they want

to go in the world.

Monastery Orphan

In many cultures, unwanted infants (whether from too many

mouths to feed at home, a love affair while a husband is away

at war, a changeling or planetouched birth, or stranger reasons)

are  exposed  to  the  elements  after  birth,  but  sometimes  these

babes are left on the doorstep of a local monastery, where they

grow up among ascetics, philosophers, and those studying the

perfection of the self. This regional background is appropriate for

characters raised in good-aligned monasteries, particularly those

associated with good deities. Some of these individuals become

monks themselves, though many turn to other careers.

Mulhorandi Royal

The royal families of Mulhorand are closely related descendants

of the physical incarnations of the Mulhorandi gods; for centu-

ries they ruled Mulhorand, and even the least of them had the

equivalent of the celestial template. Though their celestial nature

is  diminished  in  the  wake  of  the  Godswar,  the  royals  of  this

ancient land still hold incredible power and in uence. Their ways

seem strange to many in Faern, but most of the Mulhorandi

deities are good, and so are their royal mortal offspring. Raised

in the pinnacle of their society, they are well schooled, careful

with their words . . . and sometimes a little inhuman.

EXALTED FEATS

Exalted feats are only available to intelligent characters of good

alignment and the highest moral standards, and only as a gift

from  powerful  agents  of  gooddeities,  celestials,  or  similar

creatures.  Unlike  most  feats,  exalted  feats  are  supernatural  in

nature. A character must have the DMs permission to take an

exalted feat. In many cases, a ritual must be performed; often

this simply amounts to a character swearing a sacred vow, for

8/31/05   3:20:25 PM

CHARACTER OPTIONS

character can have more than one initiate feat, since such a feat

presumes a deep level of commitment to a single deity.

PSIONIC FEATS

Psionic  feats  are  available  only  to  creatures  able  to  manifest

psionic powers; in other words, they either have a psionic power

point  reserve  or  have  psi-like  (rather  than  spell-like)  abilities.

Psionic feats are supernatural abilities. They function normally

in areas of wild magic or dead magic but do not function where

psionics is suppressed.

Broken Ones Sacrifice

Your dedication to Ilmaters philosophy has given you the power

to take attacks directed at others.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, member of the Broken Ones monk order.

Bene t: As an immediate action, you can intervene on behalf

of an adjacent ally (of your size or smaller) who is under attack.

When you activate this feat, you and the ally switch spaces. If

there is not enough space for this to occur, you cant activate

the feat. Then, you suffer the harmful effect as if you were the

intended target; the ally is unaffected by it. In addition to the

obvious harmful effect this has upon you, this action is a drain

on your personal energy. Once the effect of the intervention is

resolved, you become fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you

are exhausted or if you are immune to fatigue.

You can choose to activate this feat after the success or failure

of the harmful effect is determined, but you must activate it

before the extent of the effect is determined and/or applied to

the ally.

Example: If an adjacent ally is attacked, you could wait until

after the attack roll (and con rmation roll, if the attack is a

critical threat) is made to activate the feat, but you would have

to activate it before damage is rolled. If the adjacent creature

also bene ts from a miss chance, you could wait until after that

roll was made to activate the feat.

Example:  If  an  adjacent  creature  is  within  the  area  of  a

lightning  bolt  spell,  you  could  wait  until  the  creature  rolls  its

saving  throw  (and  checks  its  spell  resistance,  if  any),  but  you

would have to activate the feat before the spells damage is rolled.

If an adjacent creature is targeted by an attack that deals a  xed

amount of damage, such as a maximized magic missile spell, you

would choose to activate this feat after the spell hit the target,

but before damage was applied.

By activating this feat, you give up any opportunity to avoid

the  harmful  effect  normally  allowed  by  a  saving  throw,  spell

resistance,  AC,  or  concealment.  If  the  effect  allows  a  saving

throw or spell resistance, you automatically fail the save or spell

resistance check. If the effect requires an attack roll, it automati-

cally hits you (and if it scored a critical hit, it automatically scores

a critical hit on you), even if you would normally bene t from a

miss chance against the attack. Any immunities or resistances you

have apply normally; for example, if you are immune to critical

hits, an attacker cant score a critical hit on you just because he

scored one on the ally.

If you cant physically interact with or manipulate objects

(for instance, if you are incorporeal or in gaseous form, or if

either you or the ally, but not both of you, are ethereal), you

cant switch places with the ally and thus cant activate this feat.

It should go without saying, but if you are incapable of taking

an action (dazed, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, and so on),

you cant use this feat.

Carmendine Monk

You have learned that study is just as important as insight to

 nding enlightenment.

Prerequisites: Int 13, member of Zealots of the Written Word

monk order (see page 105).

Bene t: You can use your Intelligence bonus instead of your

Wisdom bonus for determining your monk AC bonus and for

determining the save DC against your stunning  st and quivering

palm attacks.

You can study your thesis notes for 1 hour to treat your monk

level as two higher for determining one of the following monk

abilities: unarmed damage, AC bonus, or unarmored speed bonus.

This bene t lasts for 24 hours, at which point you can study your

notes again to gain the same or a different effect. You cant study

your notes more than once in any 24-hour period.

Defender of the Homeland

[Exalted]

You  have  sworn  a  sacred  oath  to  protect  your  country  from

evil.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, any good alignment.

Bene t: When  ghting in your home region, you gain a +1

sacred bonus to Armor Class and immunity to fear effects.

Detect Shadow Weave User

You can determine if a magic item or spellcaster is using the

Weave or the Shadow Weave.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Bene t:  Whenever  you  observe  spellcasting  or  a  magical

effect you can make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) as

an immediate action to determine if the effect comes from the

Weave  or  the  Shadow  Weave.  When  using  detect  magic,  you

automatically  identify  the  Weave  or  Shadow  Weave  origin  of

any aura you detect.

bonus on Spot checks made to recognize a doppelganger using its

change shape ability. Third, if affected by a mind  ayers mind

Bene t: You gain wild empathy (as the druid class feature),

roll and a bonus on damage equal to the sum of your cleric, druid,

(including former incarnations or variants of those deities, such

as Bhaal, Myrkul, or Xvim); if you accidentally smite a creature

that doesnt meet this requirement the smite has no effect but

is still used. You must declare the smite attempt before making

the attack.

In  addition,  you  add  the  following  spells  to  your  cleric  or

paladin spell list.

1stbless weapon (cleric only), command (paladin only).

4thhand of TormMag *.

This spell (and others) appeared in Magic of Faern with

a deity designator, but there was no rule prohibiting its use by

other clerics. If you use initiate feats in your game, you should

not allow clerics without the appropriate initiate feat to cast those

spells. Thus, only characters with the Initiate of Torm feat should

be able to cast the hand of Torm spell, even though Magic of

Faern put it on the cleric and paladin spell lists.

Initiate of Tymora [Initiate]

You  have  been  initiated  into  the  greatest  secrets  of  Tymoras

church.

Prerequisites: Cleric or ranger 4th, patron deity Tymora.

Bene t: Once per day, you can add a +5 luck bonus on any

attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check you have

just made before the DM declares whether the roll results in

success  or  failure.  If  you  have  the  Luck  domain  and  you  use

that domains power to reroll this attack, save, or check, the luck

bonus applies to the reroll as well.

In  addition,  you  add  the  following  spells  to  your  cleric  or

ranger spell list.

1st eeting fortune (see page 55).

2ndfavor of Tymora (see page 55).

Knight of the Red Falcon

[Exalted]

Your military order has a legendary ability to survive against

overwhelming odds.

Prerequisites: Cleric,  ghter, or paladin 4th, member of the

Order of the Red Falcon (see page 103).

Bene t: You gain a +1 morale bonus to Armor Class when

you are adjacent to more than one enemy. (Helpless enemies dont

count toward this bene t.)

Knight of the Risen Scepter

[Exalted]

Your military order is dedicated to  ghting Set and his minions,

and even death cannot stop you from this task.

Prerequisites: Paladin or ranger 8th, patron deity Osiris.

Bene t: You get a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against

death effects, energy drain, and ability drain.

If you are slain by a follower of Set, you come back to life 1

hour later as though resurrection had been cast upon you. Instead

of losing a level due to this effect, you gain one negative level.

If a follower of Osiris brings you back to life with raise dead,

resurrection, or a similar effect that would normally cause you

to lose a level, you gain one negative level rather than losing

a level.

You can gain the negative level bestowed by this feat even if

you are normally immune to negative levels. A negative level

bestowed by this feat cant be removed by any normal means

(such as restoration), nor does it ever become an actual lost level.

Instead, the negative level remains until you next gain a class

level, or until you kill or destroy the follower of Set who killed

you, at which point it disappears. While you have a negative level

bestowed by this feat, you lose all bene ts of this feat except the

sacred bonus on saving throws.

Knight of Tyrs Holy Judgment

[Exalted]

You can draw upon the power of Tyr to sense and understand

the law and to locate devils.

Prerequisites: Int 13, member of the Knights of Holy Judg-

ment (see page 102).

Bene t:  You  gain  a  supernatural  ability  to  sense  and  un-

derstand  laws.  Add  your  paladin  level  to  any  Knowledge  or

Intelligence check made regarding laws. You can use this ability

even if you are unfamiliar with the local laws or dont even

know where you are. For example, if you use this ability upon

approaching the city of Luthcheq in Chessenta, a  Knowledge

(arcana) or Knowledge (local Chessenta) check reveals to you

that  arcane  magic  is  forbidden  there.  If  you  later  end  up  in

a strange land by way of a portal, and a Knowledge (religion)

check reveals that Loviatar is the of cial religion where you

are, you realize you are in (for instance) Dambrath. You can use

this ability to  nd loopholes in the law, such as learning that

the local temples ability to offer a wanted criminal sanctuary

only applies from dusk until dawn, allowing you to arrest the

criminal after daybreak.

When you use your detect evil ability, the second round of

use reveals whether or not any creatures in the area are devils,

though you do not learn their exact location (but in most cases

you can identify them in the third round by the strength of

their aura).

You gain a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class against devils.

Knight of Tyrs Merciful Sword

[Exalted]

You  can  draw  upon  the  power  of  Tyr  to  sense  where  you  are

needed.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, member of the Knights of the Merciful

Sword (see page 102).

Bene t: You gain the supernatural ability to sense injustice

and  great  evil.  Once  per  week  as  a  standard  action,  you  can

concentrate to sense the direction of the greatest injustice or

evil within 1 mile of you (DMs determination). Alternatively,

you can meditate for 8 hours to expand your range to 10 miles

for that use of the feat. Murder, treason, and the presence of

evil outsiders rank highest with this sense, while other crimes,

injustices,  and  evil  creatures  rank  lower,  similar  to  the  aura

strengths listed in the detect evil spell.

You gain a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class against demons.

Mark of the Triad [Divine]

You have been initiated into the greatest secrets of the Triad, the

godly triumvirate of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater.

Prerequisites: Initiate of IlmaterPG, Initiate of Torm (see page

31), or Initiate of TyrPG.

Bene t: You can spend a turn undead attempt as a swift action

and imbue a greatsword, longsword, or unarmed strike with either

the axiomatic or holy special ability (see page 223 and 225 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide, respectively). The effect lasts until

the start of your next turn.

Overcome Shadow Weave

You  understand  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  Shadow

Weave and are more resistant to its tricks.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks,

spellcaster who uses the Weave.

Bene t: You get a +5 bonus on caster level checks to detect,

counterspell, and dispel Shadow Weave effects.

You get a +1 bonus on Will saving throws against Shadow

Weave effects.

Paladin of the Noble Heart

[Exalted]

You are tasked by Ilmater to eliminate cruelty from the world,

particularly that of Loviatar.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, member of the

Companions of the Noble Heart (see page 100).

Bene t: You get one extra smite evil attempt per day that can

only be used on followers of Loviatar or items of her church.

You get a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves against effects

created by followers of Loviatar.

Silver Blood

You have magically or alchemically imbued your  esh and blood

with silver, making you resistant to lycanthrope attacks.

Prerequisite: Base Fortitude save +2.

Bene t:  You  cannot  be  infected  with  lycanthropy.  Any

lycanthrope that bites you must make a Fortitude save (DC 10

+ 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modi er) or take damage equal

to your Constitution modi er (minimum 1 point). This damage

is treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming a lycanthropes

damage reduction.

Special: If you are already an af icted lycanthrope, the DCs

for your Control Shape checks increase by 5 and you lose your

lycanthrope  damage  reduction.  If  you  are  already  a  natural

lycanthrope, you must make a DC 15 Control Shape check to

change form and your lycanthrope damage reduction decreases

to 5/silver.

Silver Fang

By following a ritual taught by the Fangshields, your natural

attacks are suffused with the power of silver and are fully effec-

tive against lycanthropes.

Prerequisites: Base Fortitude save +4, member or ally of the

Fangshields (see page 78).

Bene t: Your natural attacks and unarmed strikes count as

silver  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage  reduc-

tion.

Special:  If  you  are  a  lycanthrope,  your  natural  attacks  no

longer infect others with lycanthropy.

Smiting Power

You use your smite ability to augment other combat maneuvers.

Prerequisites: Power Attack, ability to smite.

Bene t: You can use your smite ability (whether smite evil or

from some other source) when making a bull rush or overrun

attempt. If your smite ability would normally grant a bonus on

your attack roll against the target of your bull rush or overrun,

you can add this bonus to your Strength check instead. In addition,

if you win the opposed check to bull rush or overrun the target,

you deal damage to the target equal to the bonus the smite would

grant on a damage roll against that creature.

You  must  announce  the  smite  attempt  before  starting  the

bull rush or overrun. If your smite attempt would not grant a

bonus against the target of your bull rush or overrun attempt

(for instance, if you used smite evil when bull rushing a non-evil

creature), the attempt is wasted to no effect.

CHARACTER OPTIONS

Sword of the Arcane Order

Members of your military order have a special connection with

arcane magic.

Prerequisites: Paladin 4th of Azuth or Mystra, or ranger 4th

of Mystra; member of the Knights of the Mystic Fire (see page

102), the Order of the Shooting Star (see Knights of the Mystic

Fire, page 102), or the Swords of the High One (see page 104).

Bene t: You can use your paladin and ranger spell slots to

prepare wizard spells. You must have a minimum Intelligence

score of 10 + the spells level to prepare it, and the save DC of

the spell is equal to 10 + your Int modi er (as if you were a

wizard).

These wizard spells can be taken either from your spellbook

(if you have one) or from another characters spellbook (though

in the latter case you must decipher the writing in the book and

succeed on a Spellcraft check to prepare the spell, just as a wizard

using  a  borrowed  spellbook;  see  Wizard  Spells  and  Borrowed

Spellbooks, page 178 of the Players Handbook, for details).

If  you  also  have  levels  in  wizard,  your  wizard  caster  level

is treated as the sum of your wizard, paladin, and ranger class

levels.

Special: Azuth has a paladin order called the Swords of the

High  One.  Mystra  has  a  paladin  order  called  the  Knights  of

the Mystic Fire and a closely allied group of rangers called the

Order of the Shooting Star. Members of all three of these groups

can select this feat as long as they are at least 4th level in their

respective orders primary class.

Sun Soul Monk

Your  training  with  this  monk  order  gives  you  special  powers

depending on which sect you follow.

Prerequisites: Monk 6th, member of the Sun Soul monk order

(see page 25 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting and

page 41 of City of Splendors: Waterdeep).

Bene t: This feats bene t depends on the patron deity of the

monastery where you studied.

Lathander:  You  can  channel  your  ki  to  turn  an  undead

creature. Once per day you can choose to imbue a single unarmed

strike with ki; this decision must be made before the attack roll is

made. If you hit an undead creature with this attack, it is turned

unless it succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your

Wis modi er). If the undead creature has turn resistance, it can

add this as a bonus on its save. If you have the Stunning Fist feat,

you can also expend a daily use of your stunning  st to use this

feat. If you have the turn undead class feature, you can expend

a turn undead attempt to use this feat.

Selne:  Your  unarmed  strikes  deal  an  extra  1  point  of

cold damage and count as silvered weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. When in moonlight or starlight,

treat your monk level as three levels higher for the purpose of

determining your unarmored speed bonus.

Sune: Your combat style is fascinating to watch. Once per

day  as  a  standard  action,  you  can  perform  a  maneuver  that

fascinates a single creature within 30 feet that can see you (Will

negates; save DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + Cha modi er). Creatures

of a type different from your gain a +4 bonus on the save. This

supernatural effect lasts for 1 round. If you have the Stunning

Fist feat, you can also expend a daily use of your stunning  st

to use this feat.

Substitution Levels

Substitution levels are levels of a given class that you take to gain

certain bene ts instead of the level bene ts associated with the

standard class. Selecting a substitution level is not the same as

multiclassing; you remain in the class for which the substitution

level was taken. The class features of the substitution level simply

replace those of the normal level. To qualify for a substitution

level, you must be of the proper class. For instance, a  ghter cant

take a substitution level for the rogue or monk class.

This book presents a wide range of substitution levels af li-

ated with particular religious orders or organizations dedicated

to various causes of good (and detailed in Chapter 3). To take a

substitution level for an organization presented in this book, you

must ful ll the following criteria.

Membership in the organization.

Have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion)

Most  classes  have  a  number  of  substitution  levels,  each  of

which you can select at a speci ed class level. When you take a

substitution level for your class at a given level, you give up the

bene ts gained at that level for the standard class, and you get

the substitution level bene ts instead. You cant go back and gain

the bene ts for that level you swapped outwhen you take your

next level in the standard class, you gain the next higher level as

if you had gained the previous level normally. For instance, if you

are a 2nd-level monk and take the Broken One monk substitution

level for 3rd level, you forever lose the bene ts normally provided

to a standard 3rd-level monk (you gained instead the substitution

level bene t for a 3rd-level Broken One monk). When you gain

another level in monk, you gain the 4th-level bene ts of the

standard monk class.

Unless otherwise noted in the description of a substitution

level  bene t,  a  character  who  takes  a  substitution  level  gains

spellcasting ability (increases in spells per day and spells known,

if applicable) as if he had taken this level in the standard class.

A character need not take all the substitution levels provided

for a class. For instance, a female dwarf paladin can decide only

to  take  the  Berronar  Valkyrie  substitution  level  at  6th  level,

ignoring the previous substitution levels.

8/31/05   3:20:58 PM

CHARACTER OPTIONS

The  description  of  each  substitution  level  bene t  explains

what occurs to the standard class ability not gained, if that ability

would normally increase at a speci c rate (such as the barbarians

trap sense class feature).

Normally, if you join an organization after youve already

passed one or more of the eligible levels for substitution (such as

a character who joins the Darksong Knights at 3rd level), you

cant ever gain access to previous substitution levels. At the DMs

option, however, a character who joins an organization can be al-

lowed to retroactively apply the effect of substitution

levels for that organization. This is particularly

appropriate for characters who already belonged

to one of the organizations presented here (since

the substitution levels were unavailable until now).

The DM and player should work together to

apply the changes.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  Berronar  Valkyrie

substitution levels.

Everbright Blessing (Su): Starting at 3rd level, a Valkyries

armor, shield, and primary weapon are treated as if they had the

everbright special ability; they shine like polished silver, they are

immune to acid and rust attacks, and the armor provides her

with resistance to acid 5. This ability only applies to the items

the Valkyrie is wearing; if the items are removed

or dropped, they lose this property until she picks

them up again.

This bene t replaces the divine health class fea-

ture gained by a standard paladin at 3rd level.

Valiant Rescue (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a

Valkyrie gains a special ability to charge into

harms  way  to  protect  an  ally.  A  Valkyrie

can  charge  into  melee  with  a

creature  that  threatens  one

of her allies and still make a

full attack with a single melee

weapon  rather  than  a  single

attack. During this charge she acts as if she

had the Mobility feat; if she is mounted, this

bonus also applies to her mount.

A  Valkyrie  can  use  this  ability  a  number

of  times  per  day  equal  to  3  +  her  Charisma

modi er.

This bene t replaces the turn undead class

feature  gained  by  a  standard  paladin  at  4th

level.

Binding Oath (Su): At 6th level, a Valkyrie

gains the ability to magically link two willing

individuals  making  an  oath  (or  a  legal  agreement).  This  link

has two effects. First, it informs both parties and the Valkyrie

instantly if the oath is broken in any way. Second, the individual

who breaks the oath is fatigued for one day per paladin level of

the Valkyrie at the time of the oath-binding.

A Valkyrie can bind an oath once per week as a full-round

action.  For  every  three  paladin  levels  gained  thereafter,  the

Valkyrie can use this ability one extra time per week (2/week at

9th level, 3/week at 12th level, and so forth).

This bene t replaces the remove disease class feature gained by

a standard paladin at 6th level. A Berronar Valkyrie who selects

this substitution level never gains the  remove disease ability.

Touch  of  Fatigue  (Sp):  Beginning  at  6th  level,  a  Valkyrie

can use touch of fatigue at will. This ability is normally used to

admonish those about to stray from their promises or to punish

those  guilty  of  minor  infractions.  The  save  DC  against  this

spell-like ability is 10 + the Valkyries Charisma modi er.

CHARACTER OPTIONS

Broken One (Monk)

These kind and enduring monks dedicated to Ilmater are focused

on defending the faithful and temples of the Broken God while

acting as agents of punishment against those who would cruelly

harm others. They combine the skills of healer and hunter in

the service of their deity. They often assist other servants of the

Triad when injustices against the innocent have occurred.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Broken One substitution level, a character must have

Ilmater as her patron deity and be about to take her 3rd, 6th,

or 7th level of monk.

CLASS SKILLS

Broken One substitution levels have the class skills of the standard

monk class plus Heal and Survival.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Broken One substitution

levels.

Lay  on  Hands  (Su):  At  3rd  level,  a  Broken  One  can  gain

the ability to heal wounds with her touch (see the paladin class

feature, page 44 of the Players Handbook). If the character has

a Charisma score of 11 or lower, she can heal a number of points

of damage each day equal to her monk class level.

This bene t replaces the still mind class feature gained by a

standard monk.

Tenacious  Tracker  (Su):  Beginning  at  6th  level,  a  Broken

One gains the ability to follow the trail of those cruel enough

to torture and maim others. She receives Track as a bonus feat.

She gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to

track those with Loviatar as a patron deity.

Furthermore, whenever she physically touches the  esh of

one who has been injured within the previous hour by someone

who has Loviatar as his patron deity, she receives a clear mental

image of that persons true appearance.

This bene t replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard monk

at 6th level.

Slow Fall (Ex): A Broken Ones slow fall ability is identical

to a standard monks ability at 6th level.

Locate Creature (Sp): Starting at 7th level, a Broken One

can use locate creature once per day, but only when attempting

to  nd a creature that has Loviatar as a patron deity. Her caster

level is equal to her class level.

This bene t replaces the wholeness of body class feature gained

by a standard monk at 7th level.

Claw of the Sun and the Ankh

(Paladin)

The  rst Mulhorandi order of paladins to worship a god other

than Osiris, the Claw of the Sun and the Ankh serves Horus-Re.

Its fearless and fanatical soldiers are dedicated to energetically

pursing the evil minions of Set, relentlessly destroying them and

their foul plans whenever they are found.

Hit Die: d10.

CLASS FEATURES

Bird  of  Prey  (Su):  Beginning  at  1st  level,  once  per  day  a

Claw of the Sun and the Ankh can pay homage to his god by

taking  on  aspects  of  a  hawk.  His  hands  turn  into  claws  that

deal 1d4 points of damage; the attacks deal extra damage equal

to  one-half  his  paladin  level  to  evil  creatures.  These  attacks

are considered magic, good-aligned weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. The paladin is considered to be

pro cient  with  these  natural  weapons  while  using  this  form.

This transformation lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 +

his Charisma modi er.

At 5th level, and every  ve levels thereafter, a Claw of the

Sun and the Ankh can use this ability one extra time per day.

This bene t replaces the smite evil class feature gained by a

standard paladin. A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh never gains

any smite evil attacks at later levels.

Smite Minions of Set (Su): A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh

is tasked with eliminating members of the church of Set. Start-

ing at 6th level he can use a melee attack to attempt to smite a

creature that has Set as its patron deity. This otherwise functions

as the paladins normal smite evil class feature.

A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh can use this smite attack

once per day, plus one extra time per day for every three levels

gained beyond 6th.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins remove disease

class feature. A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh who selects this

substitution level never gains the  remove disease ability.

Horus-Res Glory (Su): Starting at 12th level, a Claws armor

shines brightly (as the daylight spell). This illumination can be

suppressed or resumed at will with a standard action.

This  bene t  replaces  the  3rd-level  spell  slot  gained  by  a

standard paladin at 12th level. From this point forward, a Claw

of the Sun and the Ankh who selects this substitution level can

prepare one less 3rd-level paladin spell than normal.

Crescent Moon Knight

(Paladin)

These  unusual  paladins  of  the  Order  of  the  Crescent  Moon

serve either Clangeddin Silverbeard or Selne. The order was

founded by an alliance between humans and dwarves to defeat

marauding lycanthropes; now, the descendants of the founders

teach old family skills and pass heirlooms to the next genera-

tion of defenders.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To  take  a  Crescent  Moon  Knight  paladin  substitution  level,

a  character  must  have  Clangeddin  Silverbeard  or  Selne  as

his patron deity, be related to or a close friend of one of the

founding families, and be about to take his 4th, 6th, or 10th

level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Crescent Moon Knight paladin substitution levels have the class

skills of the standard paladin plus Knowledge (local Impiltur).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Crescent Moon Knight

substitution levels.

Favored  Enemy  (Ex):  At  4th  level,  a  Knight  gains  lycan-

thropes as a favored enemy, just as if he were a 1st-level ranger.

Unlike standard ranger favored enemies, which are organized by

monster type, the Knights favored enemy bonuses apply to all

lycanthropes regardless of type (for example, the bonuses apply

against a human werewolf and a hill giant dire wereboar).

This bene t replaces the turn undead class feature gained by

a standard paladin at 4th level.

Cure  Lycanthropy  (Su):  Starting  at  6th  level,  a  Knight

becomes  versed  in  the  methods  of  curing  lycanthropy.  A

Knight counts as a 12th-level cleric for the purpose of curing

lycanthropy within 3 days of a lycanthropes attack. A Knight

can use his remove disease spell-like ability as if it were break

enchantment  or  remove  curse  to  cure  a  lycanthrope  on  the

nights of the full moon.

Battlesong (Su): Once per day starting at 10th level, a Knight

can begin an inspiring battle song as a standard action. This song

functions like a bards inspire courage ability, using the Knights

paladin level minus 4 as his bard level. For example, a 10th-level

paladin  who  selects  this  substitution  level  would  receive  a  +1

morale bonus on the relevant rolls, while an 18th-level paladin

would receive a +3 morale bonus. A Knight need not have any

ranks in Perform to use this class feature.

This bene t replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a stan-

dard paladin at 10th level. From this point forward, a Crescent

Moon Knight who selects this substitution level can prepare one

less 2nd-level paladin spell than normal.

Darksong Knight (Fighter)

The Darksong Knights are elite soldiers of Eilistraee who further

her many causes and hunt the yochlol, the demonic servants of

the Spider Queen. They develop an intricate, dancelike style of

swordplay and special powers to defeat their demonic enemies.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Darksong Knight substitution level, a character must

have Eilistraee as her patron deity and be about to take her 2nd,

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  Darksong  Knight

substitution levels.

Bonus  Feat:  A  Darksong  Knights  choice  of  bonus  feats  is

identical to a standard  ghters bonus feats.

Dancing Feint (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a Darksong Knight

can use her Perform (dance) skill to feint in combat as if it were

the Bluff skill.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 4th level, a Darksong Knight gains

yochlols as a favored enemy, just as if she were a 1st-level ranger.

Unlike standard ranger favored enemies, which are classi ed by

monster type, the Knights favored enemy bonuses apply only to

yochlols, not all kinds of demons.

Combat  Dancing  (Ex):  At  8th  level,  a  Darksong  Knight

with at least 5 ranks in Perform (dance) gains a +2 dodge bonus

against attacks of opportunity. If she uses Spring Attack, she

gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the attack roll made as part

of the maneuver.

Dukar (Wizard)

These wizards of a dwindling order protect the tenuous peace

under the Sea of Fallen Stars, working quietly and secretly to

achieve their goals and rebuild their numbers. Many of their

powers  stem  from  living  coral  implanted  under  the  skin  of

their hands.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Dukar substitution level, a character must be about

to take his 5th, 10th, or 15th level of wizard. The  rst time a

character takes a Dukar substitution level, he must undergo a

secret Dukar ritual that implants the living coral under the skin

of his palms (see Dukar hand coral, page 63). The coral does not

interfere with using his hands in any way. If the Dukar somehow

loses  this  coral,  he  loses  his  coral-related  powers,  but  if  he  is

implanted again he immediately regains his full abilities.

CLASS SKILLS

Dukar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard

wizard class plus Swim.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  Dukar  substitution

levels.

Bonus Spells (Ex): There are four Dukar orders, each with

two associated schools of magic. Upon taking his  rst Dukar

substitution level, a Dukar chooses one order and can never change

it thereafter (similar to choosing a wizard specialty school). Each

time a Dukar substitution level is taken, a Dukar adds two spells

to his spell book; these must be from one or both of his orders

associated schools of magic (either one from each or both from

the same). A specialist wizard Dukar is not restricted to choosing

these bonus spells from his school of specialization, but he cannot

use them to acquire spells from his prohibited school (therefore,

choosing an order that studies one of your prohibited schools is

normally a bad choice). The orders are as follows.

This class feature replaces the standard wizards ability to add two

spells to his spellbook each time he gains a wizard level.

Coral Claw (Ex): At 5th level, a Dukar can extend the coral

under  his  skin  to  form  sharp  spikes  on  his  hand,  giving  him

a  claw  attack  that  deals  1d4  points  of  damage.  The  Dukar  is

automatically pro cient in the coral weapon and can extend or

retract the coral as a swift action.

This  bene t  replaces  the  bonus  feat  normally  gained  by  a

5th-level wizard.

Coral Power:  At 10th and 15th level, a Dukar learns how to

use his implanted coral in different ways. Each time this ability

is gained, a Dukar chooses one ability from the following choices.

Each ability can be taken twice, with increasing effect.

Acid (Ex): A Dukar adds 1d4 points of acid damage to all

claw attacks (including those made with his coral claw; see above).

The acid quickly decays and cannot be stored for later use. A

Dukar and his gear are not harmed by his own corals acid. This

ability functions automatically, though a Dukar can suspend or

resume this ability as a free action. If a Dukar selects the ability

a second time, the acid damage increases to 1d8 points.

Armor  (Ex):  Three  times  per  day  as  a  standard  action,  a

Dukar can make his coral extend hard growths across his skin,

giving him a +1 enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus

to AC. These growths crumble to dust after 10 minutes. If a

Dukar selects this ability a second time, the enhancement bonus

to his natural armor increases to +2.

Color Spray (Sp): A Dukars coral gains the ability to glow

intensely in confusing patterns. At will as a standard action, a

Dukar can use this light as a color spray effect. Using this ability

requires the Dukar to have one hand free, uncovered, and able to

make gestures. The save DC of this ability is Intelligence-based.

If a Dukar takes this ability a second time, the save DC of this

ability increases by 2.

Wound Transfer (Su): A Dukars coral develops the ability

to transfer life energy by touch from him to another creature,

healing its wounds at the expense of his own health. Each use of

this ability heals the target of 1d6 points of damage and deals

a like amount of damage to the Dukar. If a Dukar chooses this

ability a second time, he heals the target of 2d6 points of damage

and takes a like amount of damage per use. This ability can never

provide a target more hit points than its full normal total +10.

Any hit points gained beyond its normal maximum are treated

as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

This  bene t  replaces  the  bonus  feat  normally  gained  by  a

10th- or 15th-level wizard.

Eternal Order (Paladin)

The primary duty of the Knights of the Eternal OrderKelem-

vors main order of paladinsis to hunt and destroy powerful

undead. They develop powerful undead- ghting powers by sacri c-

ing other paladin abilities.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take an Eternal Order substitution level, a character must

have Kelemvor as her patron deity and be about to take her 1st,

3rd, or 6th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

CLASS FEATURES

Corpsestrike (Su): An Eternal Order paladin can, as a swift

action, surround her weapon with a visible gray aura of holy power

that sheds light equal to a candle. Any weapon so affected can

ignore any damage reduction (other than DR #/epic) possessed

by an undead creature, regardless of its source. This aura lasts

for a number of minutes equal to the paladins class level.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins smite evil class

feature. Any time an Eternal Order paladin would later gain an

extra smite evil attempt (such as at 5th level), she can instead

use this ability one extra time per day.

Undead  Knowledge  (Ex):  Each  time  an  Eternal  Order

substitution level is taken, the character gains a cumulative +2

competence  bonus  on  Knowledge  (religion)  checks  concerning

undead.

Eternal Vigor (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, an Eternal Order

paladin can ignore the effects of negative levels bestowed upon

her by an undead creature.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins divine health class

feature.

Greater Turning (Su): At 6th level, an Eternal Order paladin

gains the ability to perform a greater turning once per day in

place of a regular turning, just as if she had access to the Sun

domain.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins remove disease

class feature normally gained at 6th level. At any level where

a standard paladin gains an extra daily use of remove disease,

an Eternal Order paladin instead gains another daily use of her

greater turning ability.

Fangshields Barbarian

Barbarians  of  the  Fangshields  have  few  worries  about  traps,

because they spend most of their time in their home territory

rather than crawling through dungeons. They train their bodies

to their physical peak so they can be the shock troops of the

organization,  relying  on  their  speed  and  strength  to  decimate

enemy creatures quickly. Other monsters can  ght in formation

against  massed  enemies,  but  the  Fangshields  barbarians  are

skilled at charging opposing monsters and battering them with

a few powerful hits.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Fangshields barbarian substitution level, a character

must be a nonhumanoid creature about to take his 3rd, 5th, or

7th level of barbarian.

CLASS SKILLS

Fangshields barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard barbarian class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Fangshields barbarian

substitution levels.

Fast Charge (Ex): At 3rd level, a Fangshields barbarian gains

a 10-foot enhancement bonus to his speed when he charges. This

applies to any type of movement the barbarian uses.

This bene t replaces the trap sense class feature gained by a

standard barbarian at 3rd level. At any level where a standard

barbarian gains a bonus to trap sense (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and

18th), a Fangshields barbarian instead increases the enhancement

bonus to his charge speed by 10 feet.

Awesome Charge (Ex): At 5th level, a charging Fangshields

barbarian in a rage can make an attack at the end of the charge

as if he had the Awesome Blow feat (see page 303 of the Monster

Manual), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for

that feat. (Normally, Awesome Blow requires a standard action;

this is a speci c exception to that rule.)

This bene t replaces the improved uncanny dodge class feature

gained by a standard barbarian at 5th level.

Raging Vigor (Ex): At 7th level, a Fangshields barbarian gains

the ability to direct his force of will inward, causing his injured

body to heal itself. As a standard action, he can spend one of his

daily uses of rage to heal damage equal to twice his Hit Dice. He

can even use this ability if he is already raging.

This bene t replaces the standard barbarians damage reduc-

tion  gained  at  7th  level.  Instead,  the  Fangshields  barbarian

gains  damage  reduction  1/  at  10th  level,  and  his  damage

reduction is treated as 1 point lower than normal from that

point forward.

Fangshields Druid

Druids of the Fangshields are the healers and nurturers of the

group,  acting  on  behalf  of  their  more  monstrous  allies  who

cannot  interact  with  civilized  humanoids  without  causing

fear and panic.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Fangshields druid substitution level, a character must

be a nonhumanoid creature about to take her 4th, 5th, or 7th

level of druid.

CLASS SKILLS

Fangshields druid substitution levels have the class skills of the

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Fangshields druid sub-

stitution levels.

Spontaneous Curing (Su): At 4th level, a Fangshields druid

can spontaneously convert prepared druid spells of 1st level or

higher into cure light wounds spells, just as a cleric can. Unlike

a cleric, she cannot convert her prepared spells into any cure

spell, just cure light wounds, nor can she apply metamagic feats

to these spontaneously cast spells.

This bene t replaces the resist natures lure class ability gained

by a standard druid at 4th level.

Wild Shape Hands (Su): At 5th level, a Fangshields druid can

use her wild shape ability to create simple dexterous hands if she

doesnt have them already. For example, a giant eagle, lammasu,

or unicorn could use wild shape to change her feet, paws, or hooves

into hands that work as well as human hands. These hands lose

any natural attacks they previously possessed, but otherwise still

function like their original shape (a unicorn could walk or run

at normal speed on her hoof-hands, for example). She can make

this  change  whenever  she  uses  her  wild  shape,  even  when  she

assumes another form. For example, a unicorn druid could take

the form of a wolf with functional paw-hands.

This bene t is in addition to the standard druids wild shape

ability.

Wild  Shape  (Humanoid)  (Su):  At  7th  level,  a  Fangshields

druid  can  use  her  wild  shape  ability  to  assume  a  Medium

humanoid  form.  The  humanoid  form  can  resemble  a  human,

dwarf, elf, or other Medium humanoid as the druid desires and

has the appropriate racial traits for that race (according to the

polymorph  spell).  This  ability  is  typically  used  by  a  druid  to

interact with humanoid settlements without drawing too much

attention to herself. However, the humanoid form retains some

of a Fangshields druids original monstrous appearance, much

like how a lycanthrope in hybrid form has humanoid and animal

features, resulting in a 4 penalty on Disguise checks made to

pass as a humanoid. The hybrid form can speak as well as a true

humanoid, though the change of form does not give the druid

knowledge of that forms language (a druid in the form of an

elf wouldnt automatically know how to speak Elven, but could

use her elf-mouth to speak any languages she did know).

Example: A giant eagle could wild shape into a humanlike

humanoid, but she would resemble an eaglehuman hybrid (much

like  an  avoral  guardinal);  a  treant  taking  the  form  of  an  elf

hybrid would look like a tall elf with barklike skin and leaves in

her hair (much like a dryad).

This  bene t  replaces  the  third  use  of  wild  shape  per  day

gained by a standard druid at 8th level. From this point forward,

a  Fangshields  druid  has  one  less  daily  use  of  wild  shape  than

normal.

Fangshields Ranger

Rangers of the Fangshields use their skills to patrol the wild-

lands, as well as to spy on and hunt evil creatures. However, some

of the standard ranger class features are useless to creatures that

lack hands to use manufactured weapons. Fangshields rangers

learn other abilities to take advantage of their nonhumanoid

anatomy,  helping  them  become  dangerous  leaders  of  beasts

and animals.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Fangshields ranger substitution level, a character must

be a nonhumanoid creature about to take his 2nd, 4th, or 5th

level of ranger.

CLASS SKILLS

Fangshields ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard ranger class plus Diplomacy.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er.

have a third option for their combat style: natural attacks. If a

ranger selects this combat style, at 2nd level he gains Multiattack

(if he has more than one kind of natural attack) or Improved

Natural Attack (if he has only one kind of natural attack) as a

bonus feat.

At 6th level, a ranger with this combat style gains Weapon

Focus for any one of his natural attack types. At 11th level, a

ranger with this combat option gains Weapon Focus for a second

of his natural weapons, or Greater Weapon Focus for his natural

weapon if he has only one kind.

A  Fangshields  ranger  need  not  meet  any  of  the  normal

prerequisites for these bonus feats.

Animal  Companion  (Ex):  A  Fangshields  ranger  uses  the

normal ranger animal companion rules, but because he is beastlike

himself, he has a stronger bond with the animal. The rangers

effective druid level is treated as one-half his ranger level +2.

Lion and the Unicorn (Ex): At 5th level, a Fangshields ranger

chooses an af nity for Nobanion or Lurue, even if he already

has a patron deity (this doesnt cause a religious con ict). If he

chooses Nobanion, he gets a +1 sacred bonus to AC during the

day; if he chooses Lurue, he gets a +1 sacred bonus to AC during

the night. He gets the bene t of this ability whether or not he

is outside or knows the time of day. This ability doesnt apply on

a plane other than the Material Plane.

This bene t replaces the second favored enemy class feature

gained by a standard ranger at 5th level.

Golden Cup (Paladin)

Paladins who are members of the Order of the Golden Cup serve

Ilmater and have dedicated themselves to healing the sick and

weak and protecting the innocent. Peaceful counterparts to the

Companions of the Noble Heart (see page 100), they dont shy

away from combating evil, but they allow their companions to

actively hunt it down while they focus on protecting those who

cant protect themselves.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Golden Cup substitution level, a character must have

Ilmater as her patron deity and be about to take her 3rd, 4th,

or 10th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Golden Cup substitution levels have the class skills of the standard

can grant the dodge bonus to AC from these actions to any single

creature standing adjacent to her in addition to herself.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins aura of courage

class feature.

Shield  Other  (Sp):  Beginning  at  4th  level,  a  Golden  Cup

paladin can use shield other as a spell-like ability. She needs no

focus for this ability, but she must be able to touch the character.

She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her

Charisma bonus (minimum 1/day), though she cant affect more

than one target simultaneously (a second use ends the duration of

any previous use). Her caster level is equal to her paladin level.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins turn undead class

feature.

Expanded Healing (Su): Beginning at 10th level, a Golden

Cup  paladin  can  treat  her  paladin  level  as  three  higher  than

normal for the purpose of determining the maximum amount

of healing she can bestow with her lay on hands ability per day.

She can also treat her caster level as three higher than normal

for the purpose of any conjuration (healing) spell she casts.

This bene t replaces the third daily use of the smite evil abil-

ity gained by a standard paladin at 10th level. From this point

forward, she has one less daily use of smite evil than normal.

Golden Lion (Paladin)

The  Order  of  the  Golden  Lion  serves  Torm  and  was  created

speci cally to serve the Penance of Duty accepted by those of

his faith. Members of the order are a varied bunch but united

in their devotion and strength of purpose. They develop special

powers to defend good temples, defeat Faernian evils, and repair

damage to the Weave.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Golden Lion paladin substitution level, a character must

have Torm as her patron deity, maintain the appearance of her

armor and helm in accordance with the standards of the order,

and be about to take her 1st, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Furthermore,  as  part  of  an  ongoing  atonement  for  their

churchs  hostilities  toward  other  good  churches  in  the  years

preceding the Time of Troubles, the Golden Lions pledge to help

rebuild and defend these churches. Once per month each Golden

Lion must perform a quest for or spend a day defending a good

temple of another faith. The Golden Lion must follow orders

from this temple as if they came from her own temple, but can

disregard any order that con icts with her own faith or that would

certainly result in her death (the good faiths involved understand

the boundaries of the Penance of Duty and wont ask for things

they wouldnt ask of their own champions of the faith).

CLASS SKILLS

Golden  Lion  substitution  levels  have  the  class  skills  of  the

standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Golden Lion substitution

levels.

Detect Magic (Sp): A Golden Lion can use a detect magic

effect at will. Her caster level is equal to her paladin level.

This  bene t  replaces  the  standard  paladins  detect  evil

ability.

Enemy of Strife (Su): Golden Lions are tasked with eliminat-

ing the Zhentarim and the churches of Bane and Cyric. Beginning

at 4th level, any smite evil attack used against a member of one

of these groups (or a creature created or conjured by a member

of one of these groups) automatically ignores any miss chance

from concealment and overcomes damage reduction as if it were

made with a good-aligned weapon.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins ability to turn

undead.

CHARACTER OPTIONS

Restore the Weave (Sp): At 6th level, once per day a Golden

Lion can repair a 5-foot cube of dead magic or wild magic area,

returning it to its normal function. This ability only works if

the paladin stands in an area of normal Weave that is adjacent

to the damaged area (in other words, it cannot create an island

of normal Weave within a damaged area). Slowly but surely, the

Golden Lions can repair large problem areas. This spell-like ability

is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

This bene t replaces the remove disease class feature gained

by a standard paladin at 6th level. At any level where a standard

paladin gains an extra daily use of remove disease, a Golden

Lion  can  instead  gain  another  daily  use  of  her  restore  the

Weave ability.

Holy Judge (Paladin)

This group of Tyr-worshiping paladins is focused primarily on its

gods lawful aspects. The Holy Judges hunt and punish criminals

and lawbreakers, and they have a fervent hatred for devils, which

they see as a terrible perversion of a lawful society.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Holy Judge substitution level, a character must have

Tyr as her patron deity and be about to take her 1st, 4th, or 6th

level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Holy Judge substitution levels have the class skills of the standard

paladin class plus Knowledge (the planes).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Holy Judge substitution

levels.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a Holy Judge gains devils

as a favored enemy, just as if he were a 1st-level ranger. Unlike

standard ranger favored enemies, which are classi ed by monster

type, a Holy Judges favored enemy bonuses apply only to devils,

not all kinds of evil outsiders.

44

At 5th level, and every  ve levels thereafter, the bonus granted

by the Holy Judges favored enemy class feature improves by 2.

This increase has no effect on any other favored enemies the

Holy Judge might have.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins smite evil class

feature.

Censure Devil (Su): A Holy Judge on his home plane can

utter words of censuring that can daze a devil within 30 feet.

The devil must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin

level + Cha modi er) or be dazed for 1 round. A Holy Judge

can use this ability a number of times per day equal to three +

his Charisma modi er.

Zone of Truth (Sp): A Holy Judge can use a zone of truth

effect once per week, using his paladin level as his caster level.

This bene t replaces the standard paladin remove disease

class feature. If the Holy Judge would later gain an extra weekly

use of remove disease, he instead gains an extra weekly use of

zone of truth.

Lion Legionnaire (Paladin)

The mighty wemic paladins of Nobanion are called the Legion of

Lions; they are small in number but great in their bravery. Unlike

most of Lord Firemanes wemic followers, they travel outside

the Shaar in search of evil, and partly because of their efforts

Nobanions faith has attracted humanoid followers. Though most

Lion Legionnaires are wemics, a small number are humanoids,

and at least one lammasu is a member of this elite group. Rather

than traditional paladin abilities, they develop powers relating to

Nobanions strengths and tactics.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Lion Legionnaire substitution level, a character must

have Nobanion as his patron deity and be about to take his 3rd,

4th, or 5th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Lion Legionnaire substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard paladin class plus Knowledge (nature).

CHARACTER OPTIONS

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  Lion  Legionnaire

substitution levels.

Firemane Aura (Su): Once per day a Lion Legionnaire can

create  an  aura  of  holy   ame  around  his  body.  As  this  ability

activates, the paladins hair or mane (if any) momentarily turns

into a brilliant golden  ame. Any evil creature striking a Lion

Legionnaire with a natural weapon, or a melee weapon that is

not  a  reach  weapon,  takes  damage  equal  to  the  Legionnaires

paladin level. Half of this damage is  re damage, but the other

half  results  directly  from  divine  power  and  is  therefore  not

subject to being reduced by resistance to  re. This aura lasts for

1 minute.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins aura of courage

class feature.

Wild Fighting (Su): Lion Legionnaires develop a  ghting style

that gives them extra attacks at the cost of accuracy. As a free

action, a Lion Legionnaire can enter a state of wild  ghting for

1 round. During this round, a Legionnaire can make one extra

attack with any one melee weapon (including natural weapons),

but all attacks made during the round (including the extra attack)

take a 2 penalty. A Lion Legionnaire must use a full attack

action to bene t from wild  ghting. A Lion Legionnaire can

use this ability a number of times per day equal to three + his

Charisma modi er.

This bene t replaces the turn undead class feature gained by

a standard paladin at 4th level.

Flying Lion (Su): At 5th level, a Lion Legionnaire gains the

ability to grow eagles wings, as Nobanion himself sometimes does

in battle. Once per day as a full-round action, the Legionnaire

grows feathered wings appropriate to the size of his body. The

wings remain for up to 10 minutes per paladin level, though he

can dismiss them as a free action. He can  y with the wings at

his normal land speed, with poor maneuverability. Nonleonine

creatures who use this ability temporarily gain a lionlike ap-

pearance while it is used (catlike eyes, a thick mane of hair, and

larger teeth).

This bene t replaces the special mount class feature gained by

a standard paladin at 5th level (Nobanions wemic paladins have

no need for a quadruped mount to carry them into battle).

Mystic Fire Knight (Paladin)

The Knights of the Mystic Fire serve Mystra by guarding her

temples  and  questing  for  lost  magical  troves.  They  develop

increased ability to use magic, counter hostile magic, and defeat

enemy spellcasters.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Mystic Fire Knight substitution level, a character must

have Mystra as her patron deity and be about to take her 4th,

5th, or 6th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Mystic Fire Knight substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard paladin plus Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  Mystic  Fire  Knight

substitution levels.

Bonus Spell (Su): At 4th level, a Mystic Fire Knight gains a

bonus 1st-level paladin spell slot as if from a high Wisdom score.

At 8th level, she gains a bonus 2nd-level paladin spell slot, at

11th level she gains a bonus 3rd-level paladin spell slot, and at

14th level she gains a bonus 4th-level paladin spell slot.

This bene t replaces the turn undead class feature gained by

a standard paladin at 4th level.

Improved Spellcasting (Ex): When casting paladin spells, a

Mystic Fire Knight can treat her caster level as equal to one-half

her paladin level +2. If she also has arcane spellcasting ability

from another class, she can add her caster level from that class

to this value to determine her paladin caster level.

Smite Evil (Su): In addition to the normal effect, when a

Mystic Fire Knight of 5th level or higher hits a creature with

her smite evil attack, that creature  nds it temporarily dif cult

to cast spells or use spell completion or spell trigger items. For

1 round, any attempt to complete one of these actions requires

a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + paladins level + Cha

modi er + spell level); failure means that the action fails. If a

spell was being cast, the spell or spell slot is lost; if a magic item

was being activated, the attempt merely fails. Multiple smite evil

hits on the same creature dont have a cumulative effect.

This class feature augments, but does not replace, the standard

paladins smite evil class feature.

CHARACTER OPTIONS

Spellshatter (Su): Once per day starting at 6th level, a Mystic

Fire Knight can choose to deliver a targeted greater dispel magic

effect with a melee attack. The decision to use this ability must be

made before the attack is rolled; if the attack misses, the effect

is wasted.

If  the  attack  hits,  treat  this  as  if  the  Mystic  Fire  Knight

had cast a targeted greater dispel magic on the creature struck,

using her paladin level (plus any arcane caster level she might

have from another class) as her caster level, up to a maximum

of +20.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins remove disease

class feature. If the Mystic Fire Knight would later gain an extra

weekly use of remove disease, she instead gains an extra daily use

of spellshatter.

Noble Heart (Paladin)

The Companions of the Noble Heart are aggressive knights in

the service of Ilmater who have dedicated themselves to elimi-

nating the evil of those who are known to enjoy the torturing

and  suffering  of  others.  In  particular,  they  oppose  members

of the church of Loviatar and destroy them and their temples

whenever possible. When servants of the other members of the

Triad crusade against Loviatars servants, Noble Heart knights

often join with them.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Noble Heart substitution level, a character must have

Ilmater as her patron deity and be about to take her 3rd, 4th,

or 6th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Noble  Heart  substitution  levels  have  the  class  skills  of  the

standard paladin class plus Survival.

CLASS FEATURES

levels.

Tenacious Tracker (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a Noble Heart

paladin gains the ability to follow the trail of those cruel enough

to torture and maim others. She receives Track as a bonus feat.

She gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to

track those who have Loviatar as a patron deity.

Furthermore, whenever she physically touches the  esh of

one who has been injured within the previous hour by someone

who has Loviatar as his patron deity, she receives a clear mental

image of that persons true appearance.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins divine health class

feature.

Sunder the Sadistic (Su): At 4th level, a Noble Heart pala-

din gains the ability to reduce to rubble objects and structures

dedicated to evil. Whenever she attacks an object owned by a

character who has Loviatar as a patron deity, or an object that

is part of a temple or other structure dedicated to Loviatar, she

can ignore the objects hardness. She can also use her smite evil

class ability against such objects as if they were evil creatures.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins ability to turn

undead.

Delay Poison (Sp): The enemies of the Noble Heart paladin

frequently  employ  poison  in  their  efforts  to  spread  evil  and

cruelty. Starting at 6th level, a Noble Heart paladin can use a

delay poison effect once per week using her paladin level as her

caster level.

This bene t replaces the remove disease class feature gained

by a standard paladin. If she would later gain extra weekly uses

of remove disease, the Noble Heart paladin instead gains extra

weekly uses of delay poison.

Phoenix Disciple (Monk)

The Disciples of the Phoenix are unusual lawful good Kossuthan

monks. They are extremely disciplined and take some of their

beliefs to painful extremes. Obsessed with the power of  re to

purify,  they  have  developed  strange  monk  abilities  based  on

that concept.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Phoenix Disciple substitution level, a character must

be lawful good, have Kossuth as his patron deity, and be about

to take his 1st, 3rd, or 12th level of monk.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Phoenix Disciple substitu-

tion levels.

Purifying  Flame  (Su):  A  Phoenix  Disciple  can  transform

his ki into purifying  re. Once per round, a Phoenix Disciple

can add 1d6 points of  re damage to any

unarmed strike. The decision to use this

ability must be made before the attack is

rolled; if the attack misses, the power is

wasted. A Phoenix Disciple can use this

ability a number of times per day equal

to his monk level.

This bene t replaces the bonus feat

gained by a standard 1st-level monk.

Purple Staff (Cleric)

The Followers of the Purple Staff are a group of divine spellcast-

ers trying to create a benign theocracy in the eastern part of the

Dragon Coast. These clerics carry a great deal of political power

within the borders of the so-called Holy Realm and use their

magic to aid the citizens of their new land.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Purple Staff substitution level, a character must have

Chauntea, Helm, Lathander, Nobanion,

Selne, or Sune as his patron deity and

be  about  to  take  his  4th,  6th,  or  9th

level of cleric.

CLASS SKILLS

Purple Staff substitution levels have the

class skills of the standard cleric class.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level:  2  +  Int

modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the

Purple Staff substitution levels.

Spontaneous Faith Healing (Su): At

4th level, a Purple Staff cleric gains the

ability to spontaneously convert prepared

cleric spells of 1st level or higher to cast

faith healingMag in the same way she can

convert them to cure spells. Armed with

this power, a Purple Staff cleric is easily

able to deal with even the most severe

injuries that common folk might suffer.

This class feature replaces the 2nd-level

spell slot gained by a standard cleric at

4th  level.  From  this  point  forward,  a

Purple  Staff  cleric  has  one  less  2nd-level

spell slot than normal.

Imbue with Spell Ability (Sp): At 6th level, a Purple Staff

cleric  can  use  an  imbue  with  spell  ability  effect  to  imbue  a

creature  with  a  single  0-  or  1st-level  spell  she  has  prepared.

She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to

one-half her class level. With this power, an adventuring Purple

Staff cleric can leave nonspellcaster lieutenants in town to act

on  her  behalf  in  emergencies  or  to  spread  out  her  spells  to

help defend a larger area (though she is not limited to these

purposes, of course).

Turn Invader (Su): At 9th level, a Purple Staff cleric is so

devoted to protecting his homeland that he can use his ability

to turn undead to frighten enemies of the Holy Realm. When

standing within the borders of his country, he can turn hostile

monsters or enemies of the Holy Realm as a good-aligned cleric

turns undead. He cannot destroy such creatures outright using

this ability.

Red Falcon (Paladin)

Members of the Order of the Red Falcon serve the Red Knight

and have earned fame in Tethyr for their heroics. They have a

reputation for being excellent military tacticians, and even their

followers are a cut above the norm.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Red Falcon substitution level, a character must have

the Red Knight as her patron deity and be about to take her 2nd,

4th, or 6th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Red Falcon substitution levels have the class skills of the standard

paladin class plus Knowledge (history).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Red Falcon substitution

levels.

Brilliant Strategy (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a Red Falcon

can draw upon her instinct for battle to give her an amazing

ability to predict the imminent actions of her enemies and her

best options for taking advantage of those actions. Activating

this ability is an immediate action; it grants her an insight bonus

to AC equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) for 1 round. A Red

Falcon can use this ability a number of times per day equal to

one-half her class level.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins divine grace class

feature.

Expanded Spell List: At 4th level, a Red Falcon adds augury

(2nd level), deathwatch (1st level), and status (2nd level) to her

paladin spell list.

Military Knowledge (Ex): Each time a Red Falcon substitution

level is taken, the character gains a cumulative +2 competence

bonus  on  Knowledge  checks  concerning  military  history  or

strategy.

Turn Undead (Su): A Red Falcon is not as skilled at turning

undead as a normal paladin. She can only use this ability a number

of times per day equal to her Charisma modi er.

Spontaneous Extend Spell (Su): At 6th level, once per day a

Red Falcon can cast one of her spells as if she had prepared it with

the Extend Spell feat. Doing this does not require a higher-level

slot or increase the casting time for the spell.

This class feature replaces the 1st-level spell slot normally

gained at 6th level. From this point forward, a Red Falcon has

one less 1st-level paladin spell slot than normal.

Trained Militia: At 6th level, due to her leadership and skill

at war, all cohorts and followers of the Red Falcon are treated

as if they had Martial Weapon Pro ciency in a single weapon

of the Red Falcons choice. This bene t remains as long as the

cohorts and followers remain in her service and as long as she

meets with them at least once a month to refresh their training. If

more than a month goes by without such a meeting, the cohorts

and followers lose this pro ciency until she has the opportunity

to train them again. A Red Falcon can grant different weapon

pro ciencies  to  different  cohorts  and  followers  (they  dont  all

have to gain longsword pro ciency, for example).

Expanded Spell List: At 3rd level, a Ruby Rose Knight adds

love bite (see page 56) to her paladin spell list (even though she

cant actually cast the spell herself until at least 4th level).

Heroism (Sp): At 6th level, a Ruby Rose Knight can use a

heroism effect once per week, using her class level as her caster

level. She cant use this spell-like ability on herself, only on another

creature.

This bene t replaces the remove disease class feature gained

by a standard paladin. If she would later gain extra weekly uses

of remove disease, a Ruby Rose Knight instead gains extra weekly

uses of heroism.

Heroic Rapture (Su): At 12th level, once per day a Ruby Rose

Knight can spend a full-round action embracing another creature

to grant it great bravery. The affected creature gains a +4 morale

bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear

effects, and a number of temporary hit points equal to the Ruby

Rose Knights paladin level. The effect lasts for 1 minute.

This  bene t  replaces  the  3rd-level  spell  slot  gained  by  a

standard paladin at 12th level. From this point on, a Ruby Rose

Knight has one less 3rd-level spell slot than normal.

Shadow Sword (Ranger)

Rangers of the Knights of the Shadow Sword patrol Myth Dran-

nor and attempt to rid it of the evils living there. They use their

stealth and spell-power to aid the  ghters of their order.

tions if the ranger is wearing light or no armor and carrying no

more than a light load.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are features of the Shooting Star ranger

substitution levels.

Weavespeak (Sp): Because the members of this order need to

report their  ndings over long distances, starting at 3rd level

a Shooting Star develops the power to use the Weave itself to

transmit short messages. Once per day the character can trans-

mit a message of twenty- ve words or less to the nearest cleric,

paladin, or ranger of Mystra (the Shooting Star cant choose the

recipient). This ability only functions where the Weave is active,

and it cannot jump planar boundaries; the ranger knows if either

condition would prevent the message from reaching its target. It

is otherwise the equivalent of a sending spell.

This bene t replaces the Endurance bonus feat gained by a

standard ranger at 3rd level.

Bonus Spells (Su): At 4th level, a Shooting Star gains a bonus

1st-level ranger spell slot as if from a high Wisdom score. At 8th

level she gains a bonus 2nd-level ranger spell slot, at 11th level

she gains a bonus 3rd-level ranger spell slot, and at 14th level

she gains a bonus 4th-level ranger spell slot.

This  bene t  replaces  the  animal  companion  class  feature

gained by a standard ranger at 4th level.

Improved Spellcasting (Ex): When casting ranger spells, a

Shooting Star can treat her caster level as equal to one-half her

ranger level +2. If she also has arcane spellcasting ability from

another class, she can add her caster level from that class to this

value to determine her caster level.

Expanded Spell List: At 8th level, a Shooting Star adds see

invisibility (2nd level) and word of recall (4th level) to her ranger

spell list.

This replaces the standard rangers swift tracker class feature.

Bane Weapon (Su): At 6th level, a Shadow Sword learns how

to temporarily turn any weapon he wields into a bane weapon

(see page 224 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). Activating this

ability requires a full-round action, at which point the ranger

must choose the type (and subtype, if appropriate) of creature

against which the bane special ability will apply. This choice must

match a creature type (and subtype) of one of the rangers favored

enemies. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to one-half

the rangers class level, and can be used a number of times per

day equal to one + his Wisdom modi er (minimum 1/day). The

bane ability only functions while the weapon is in the rangers

hands. The ranger can have no more than one weapon affected

by this class feature at any time, nor can any weapon bene t

from more than one application of this class feature (in either

case, a second use immediately ends any previous effect).

This benefit replaces the improved combat style class fea-

ture normally gained at 6th level. If a Shadow Sword ranger

later gains combat style mastery, he instead gains improved

combat style.

Portal Analysis (Su): At 8th level, a Shadow Sword gains the

ability to sense portals and manipulate them in strange ways.

He  automatically  detects  any  portal  within  10  feet  and  can

thereafter study any portal within 10 feet as if using analyze

portal  (see  page  66  of  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign

Setting). If he is able to activate the portal, once per day the

Shadow Sword can enter it as if using the portal well spell (see

page 56).

This bene t replaces the swift tracker class feature gained by

a standard ranger at 8th level.

Shooting Star (Ranger)

Rangers  of  the  Order  of  the  Shooting  Star  (see  Knights  of

the  Mystic  Fire,  page  102)  serve  Mystra  by  scouting,  spying,

and  dealing  with   ends  and  monstrosities  created  by  magical

experimentation.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Shooting Star substitution level, a character must have

Mystra as her patron deity and be about to take her 3rd, 4th,

or 8th level of ranger.

CLASS SKILLS

Shooting  Star  substitution  levels  have  the  class  skills  of  the

standard ranger class plus Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er.

CHARACTER OPTIONS

This bene t replaces the standard paladins detect evil class

feature.

Expanded Spell List: A Vigilant Eye adds see invisibility (2nd

level) to her paladin spell list.

Vigilant Aid (Su): Starting at 3rd level, when a Vigilant Eye

uses the aid another special attack in melee combat to give an ally

a bonus to his AC, she only has to spend a move action rather

than a standard action. She can use more than one aid another

special attack in a single round, but no ally can be aided more

than once per round in this fashion.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins divine health class

feature.

Awesome Smite (Su): At 4th level, a Vigilant Eye gains the

ability to repel enemies with powerful holy power. As a standard

action, she can spend a daily smite evil attempt and strike an

evil creature as if she had the Awesome Blow feat (see page 303

of the Monster Manual), even if she does not have the normal

prerequisites  for  that  feat.  Note  that  the  paladin  doesnt  also

gain the normal bene t of smite evil. She is treated as if one size

category larger than normal for determining which creatures she

can affect with this ability. If she accidentally uses this ability

against a creature that isnt evil, she deals normal damage but

the Awesome Blow effect is not triggered, and it still counts as

one of her daily uses of smite evil.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins turn undead class

feature.

Wary Swordknight (Paladin)

Members  of  Arvoreens  Marchers  kept  hal ing  villages  safe

during Tethyrs Interregnum; the Wary Swordknights are the

paladins of the order, and are known for their martial prowess

and vigilant nature.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Wary Swordknight substitution level, a character must

be a hal ing, have Arvoreen as her patron deity, and be about to

take her 3rd, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Wary Swordknight substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard paladin plus Listen and Spot.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Vigilant Eye of Helm (Paladin)

This paladin order of Helm is growing rapidly and impressing

the common folk with its members humility and self-sacri-

 ce. The Vigilant Eyes of Helm defend the innocent from

threats and develop special ways of recognizing danger and

protecting others.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To take a Vigilant Eye substitution level, a character must have

Helm as her patron deity and be about to take her 1st, 3rd, or

4th level of paladin.

CLASS SKILLS

Vigilant  Eye  substitution  levels  have  the  class  skills  of  the

Know Greatest Enemy (Su): A Vigilant Eye automatically

knows which enemy in her presence is the most powerful (in

game  terms,  which  enemy  has  the  highest  CR).  This  bene t

applies only to enemies that she can see that are within 60 feet

of her. She does not need to use an action to know this, and

this sense updates automatically if current foes leave or die or if

new opponents arrive. She doesnt know why the most powerful

enemy is such (for example, she wouldnt know that the most

powerful orc in a patrol was a 3rd-level barbarian), just that it

is so. She doesnt know exactly how tough this enemy is, but

does know if that enemy is signi cantly more powerful than

her (in game terms, if its CR is 4 or more above her effective

character level).

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  Wary  Swordknight

substitution levels.

Tougher  than  Small  (Ex):  When  a  Wary  Swordknight  is

subject to a size modi er or special size modi er for an opposed

check  (such  as  during  grapple  checks,  bull  rush  attempts,  and

trip  attempts),  she  is  treated  as  one  size  larger  if  doing  so  is

advantageous to her. A Wary Swordknight is also considered to

be one size larger when determining whether a creatures special

attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole)

can affect her. The bene ts of this class feature stack with effects

that change her size category.

This bene t replaces the standard paladins aura of courage

class feature.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 4th level, a Swordknight gains un-

canny dodge (as the barbarian class feature of the same name).

This bene t replaces the standard paladins turn undead class

feature.

Haste (Sp): At 6th level, a Swordknight becomes able to use

a haste effect on herself once per day. Her caster level for this

ability is equal to one-half her paladin level.

This bene t replaces the 1st-level spell slot gained at 6th level,

as well as the remove disease class feature normally gained at 6th

level. From this point forward, a Wary Swordknight has one less

weekly use of remove disease than normal.

Spells

In a world of magic such as Faern, the right spell at the right

time is sometimes the difference between life and death. Some

of the spells described here are only available to characters who

have the proper initiate feat (as indicated in the Level entry of

the spell description); some provide extra abilities when prepared

by a spellcaster; and others are more effective for sorcerers than

members of other classes.

Sanctified Magic

For  those  willing  to  utterly  devote  themselves  to  good,  great

power  is  available  in  the  form  of  sancti ed  magic.  Sancti ed

spells require a great sacri ce from the caster in exchange for

powerful results. The sancti ed spells described below (and the

level  of  each  spell)  are  animate  with  the  spirit  (4th),  benign

projection  (6th),  celestial  fortress  (4th),  create  lantern  archon

(3rd), and vision of punishment (1st).

Spellcasters prepare sancti ed spells just as they do regular

spells, and casters who do not prepare spells (including sorcerers

and bards) cannot make use of them except from a scroll. Evil

characters cannot cast sancti ed spells, including ones cast from

magic items.

A sancti ed spell usually has no material component, but it

does have a sacri ce component: The spell draws power from

a sacri ce accepted by the spellcaster in the form of ability

damage,  ability  drain,  or  occasionally  greater  sacri ces  (the

loss of a level or even the casters life). The sacri ce occurs

when  the  spells  duration  expires.  (No  sancti ed  spell  has  a

permanent duration.)

If a sancti ed spell is made into a potion, scroll, wand, or some

other magic item, the user of the item makes the sacri ce, not

the creator. (The creator still pays the XP cost and gp cost for

creating the item.) This sacri ce, speci ed in the spells descriptive

text, is paid each time the item is used.

Sancti ed spells are speci c to no character class. They are

neither inherently arcane nor divine spells. A divine caster casting

a sancti ed spell casts it as a divine spell, and an arcane caster

casts it as an arcane spell.

While wizards, druids, rangers, and paladins can all prepare

sancti ed spells, clerics have a special advantage: they can spon-

taneously cast any sancti ed spell, just as they can spontaneously

cast cure spells.

to inhabit a corpse within range, which becomes animated by the

spirit. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea

answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If

you know an individual creatures name, you can request that

individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you

might  get  a  different  creature  anyway).  The  Hit  Dice  of  the

corpse to be animated (not counting class levels) cannot exceed

your caster level.

The possessed body attacks your opponents to the best of its

ability. If you can communicate with the possessing spirit, you

can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to

perform other actions.

While the body is inhabited by the spirit, it is

treated as if were still alive but possessed. It uses

the outsiders Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,

base attack bonus, base save bonuses,

alignment, mental abilities, and any

class levels it might have. The

body  regains  the  Strength,

Dexterity,  Constitution,

hit  points,  and  innate

abilities of the creature the

corpse represented when it

was  alive.  For  example,  a

sahuagins  body  breathes

water and a trolls body re-

generates. The spirit cant

choose  to  activate  the

host bodys extraordinary

or  supernatural  abilities,

and  the  host  bodys  spells

and spell-like abilities do not

stay with the body.

The spirit remains within the body until

the  spell  is  dismissed,  the  duration  ends,  or  the

host body is slain, at which point it returns to its

original body with no ill effects.

Sacri ce Component: 1d3 points of Strength drain.

Benign Projection

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Sancti ed 6

Components: V, S, DF, sacri ce

Range: See text

This spell functions like project image, except as noted above

and as follows. You can create an image of your entire body or

just your face, and you can cause it to shed light as a candle at

will. It can only mimic your actions and speech (you cannot

direct it to perform other actions). The image can cast spells

only from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjura-

tion (healing).

Sacri ce Component: 1d2 points of Strength damage.

Celestial Fortress

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sancti ed 4

Components: V, S, DF, sacri ce

This  spell  functions  like  Leomunds  secure  shelter,  except  as

noted above and as follows. The structure

is a simple  at-roofed fort rather

than a cottage. It has a sturdy

door  and  a   replace  but  no

windows;  access  to  the  roof

is  through  a  ladder  and  a

sturdy hatch. The fortress

resonates with the power

of  your  deitys  home

plane, and it is protected

by consecrate and magic

circle against evil.

The fortresss appear-

ance  re ects  your  deity

and  deitys  realm.  For

example,  Mystras  forts

created by this spell look

like  high-fantasy  castles,

those  of  Mulhorandi

deities look native to their

land, those of dwarven deities

A celestial fortress makes an

ideal refuge for great heroes

Sacri ce Component: 1d2 points of Constitu-

for 10 minutes.

Create Lantern Archon

Con juration (Creation) [Good, Light]

Level: Sancti ed 3

Com ponents: V, S, DF, sacri ce

Casting Time: 1 hour

Ran ge: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Eff ect: One lantern archon

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You cause the target to glow with the rosy light of the dawn.

In addition to acting as a daylight spell, the light is harmful to

oozes and undead. When the spell is cast, and at the beginning of

each of your turns thereafter, such creatures take 1d6 points of

damage if within the bright light of the spell (out to 60 feet) or

1 point of damage per round if within the shadowy illumination

of the spell (more than 60 feet, out to 120 feet). If the subject is

touched by such a creature using a touch attack, or if it hits the

subject with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, it takes 1d6

points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6+15),

with a Will saving throw for half damage.

If you cast this spell on yourself, you can suppress or restore

this light as a free action once each round.

This spell was created by clerics of the church of Lathander,

but  they  do  not  try  to  restrict  its  use  to  only  those  of  their

faith.

Disk of Solar Vengeance

Evocation [Fire]

Level: Initiate of Horus-Re 1

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level or until discharged (D)

You  sacri ce  a  small  part  of  your  own  life  force  to  create  a

new lantern archon (see page 16 of the Monster Manual) in

the  service  of  your  patron.  The  lantern  archon  is  not  under

your control but is friendly to you. It willingly performs one

nonhazardous task of your choice taking up to 1 hour without

requiring  any  payment.  Alternatively,  you  can  request  that  it

perform a hazardous or longer task, but in this case payment

is  requiredsee  lesser  planar  ally,  page  261  of  the  Players

Handbook, for details on tasks and payment. Upon completion

of the task, the lantern archon is magically transported to your

deitys home plane.

Sacri ce Component: 1d2 points of Constitution drain.

This spell creates a disk of sunlike  ames behind your head. The

 ames give you resistance to cold 5. In addition, if any creature

strikes you with a natural attack, an unarmed strike, or a melee

weapon that is not a reach weapon, it takes 1d6 points of  re

damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5) after dealing its

normal damage to you. This instantly discharges the spell. If the

attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures

wielding reach weapons, such as longspears, trigger this effect

but are not subject to this damage if they attack you. You can

also use the spell to attack as if it were a touch spell (a successful

hit discharges the spell).

light resembling moonlight. You can change the intensity from a

faint glow equivalent to a candle to a clear, bright light equivalent

to a torch. It varies in color as you desire, whether blue-white,

soft green, white, or silver. You can use this moon re as a melee

touch attack that deals 2d6 points of cold damage +1 point per

caster level (maximum +5). Whether or not the attack hits, the

spell effect is discharged.

You can cause the moonlight to leave your body and move

about as a single light similar to dancing lights. Once it leaves

gold dragon, or Torms holy symbol (your choice when you cast

the spell). It is treated as +1 mithral full plate for all purposes

(including arcane spell failure chance), and you are treated as

pro cient with this armor. Removing or destroying the armor

dismisses the spell. This spell has no effect if you are already

wearing armor.

Torm the True is served by gold and silver dragons, and some

of these dragons are the founders of ancient sorcerer bloodlines

among the younger races. If you are a sorcerer, the armor also

gives you resistance to  re 10.

Focus: A gold coin and a piece of mithral in the shape of a

dragonscale.

Drawing upon the talents of some creatures of the insect world, you

change your  esh to make it unpalatable to other creatures. Any

creature that hits you with a bite attack becomes nauseated until

the end of your next turn unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.

Creatures immune to poison are unaffected by this spell.

This spell originated in Nobanions faith. It functions like remove

fear except as noted above.

Love Bite

Evocation [Force]

Level: Initiate of the Holy Realm 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous; see text

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell originated in Sunes faith. You determine at the time

of casting what effect it takes.

Fleeting Kiss: The target feels the sensation of a brief, tender

kiss on a visible part of her body or on her mouth if her body

is completely covered. This effect is often used as a signal.

Love Bite: The target takes 1 point of damage.

In either case, if you are holding the charge on a touch spell of

2nd level or lower when you cast love bite, this spell also delivers

the touch spell to the target as if you had touched it directly

(normal saving throws and spell resistance for the touch spell

applies, if applicable). You must make a melee touch attack as

normal with a +2 bonus. This form of the spell always attacks

from your direction and cannot  ank targets as a creature can.

Using this spell to deliver a held charge is an exception to the

normal rule that casting another spell while holding a charge

dissipates the held spell.

Portal Well

Transmutation

Level: Bard 2, cleric 2, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Active portal touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

When you step into a portal affected by this spell, you can wait for

a short time within an extradimensional space between the portals

entrance and exit. This spell only works on a portal you are able

to activate; for example, if you are an elf and the target portal

doesnt work for elves, you cant use this spell on the portal.

The extradimensional space created by this spell is similar to

that created by a rope trick spell but can only hold you and your

gear (up to your maximum heavy load). When the spell ends,

you exit the portal at either your point of entry or the portals

destination.

While within this extradimensional space, you can see the

origin and destination locations, though the images are blurry

(much like viewing the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane).

Dispel magic or gate seal traps you within the extradimensional

space  for  as  long  as  the  portal  is  negated  or  sealed  (as  would

surrounding both ends with a dead magic area). Mordenkainens

disjunction or some other effect that destroys a portal outright

forcibly ejects you from one random end of the portal and deals

5d6 points of damage to you.

This spell originated in Shaundakuls church and is hard to

 nd elsewhere.

Arcane Material Component: A silver wire tied in a knot.

Shard Blessing Aura

Abjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

This  spell  creates  an  aura  of  shim-

mering  blue-white  light  similar  to

moonlight  that   lls  your  space  and

moves  with  you.  The  aura  sheds

light equal to a candle. This aura

functions like a lesser globe of in-

vulnerability. If you are a sorcerer

and  Selne  is  your  patron,  the

aura also grants you the bene t

of protection from evil.

The spell is named for the Shards,

planetar servants of Selne drawn from

the ranks of her greatest priestesses. Be-

cause some shards return to Faern to

visit their mortal lovers, supernatural

bloodlines (usually aasimar, but not

always) with ties to Selne exist in

some parts of the world.

Material  Component:  A

moonstone or other polished

white stone.

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: One suit of magic armor

Duration: 1 hour/level (D); see text

You create a shining silver breastplate around your body. The

armor is etched with a dragonscale pattern, an image of a silver

dragon, or Torms holy symbol (your choice when you cast the

spell).  It  is  treated  as  +1  mithral  breastplate  for  all  purposes

(including arcane spell failure chance), and you are treated as

pro cient with this armor. Removing or destroying the armor

dismisses the spell. This spell has no effect if you are already

wearing armor.

An elf wizard protects himself with silver dragonmail

You  create  a  slender  stone

pillar 2 feet in diameter and

6  feet  tall.  It  can  be  square,

cylindrical, hexagonal, natural-

looking,  or  any  similar  shape.

It must be solid and complete (without hollow spaces or secret

compartments). When you create the runic marker, you can also

have a message of up to twenty- ve words inscribed upon it.

The runic marker also bears a glyph of warding (blast glyph

only). In addition to the normal trigger conditions available

for a glyph of warding, you can set it to activate if the pillar

ever takes damage from a magical effect. When the glyph of

warding effect activates, the runic marker is destroyed, leaving

nothing behind.

Material Component: One vial of holy water.

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/3 levels

This spell grants you spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster

level. If you are a sorcerer, this spell also grants you a +5 resistance

bonus on saving throws against poison.

Some  of  Mystras  servants  are  steel  dragons,  shapeshifting

creatures  who  love  living  among  humanoids.  Some  sorcerers

claim their magic comes from a long-ago dragon ancestor, one

of the  rst steel dragons to serve Mystra in Faern.

Material Component: A piece of steel in the shape of a seven-

pointed star or a steel holy symbol of Mystras faith.

Spellsong

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Eilistraee 6

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you immediately prepare one spell of

4th level or lower in this spells slot. The spell must be a spell

you could normally prepare in that slot (for example, you could

not prepare a wizard spell or a domain spell). The spell works

like any spell prepared in the normal manner, including requiring

the normal components.

Like a bard spell, casting spellsong always requires a verbal

component, and you cannot use Silent Spell or similar effects to

cast the spell without a verbal component.

Spellsong, Lesser

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Eilistraee 3

58

This spell functions like spellsong, except you can use it only to

prepare one spell of 1st level or lower in this spells slot.

Spiderbind

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One spider or spiderlike creature/level, no two of

which can be more than 30 ft. apart

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically reduced

rate, as the slow spell. It can only take a single move action or

standard action each turn, but not both (nor can it take full-

round  actions).  Additionally,  it  takes  a  1  penalty  on  attack

rolls, AC, and Re ex saves. A slowed creature moves at half

its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment),

which  affects  the  creatures  jumping  distance  as  normal  for

decreased speed.

In addition, any attack by the creature that would normally

include  poison  (such  as  a  spiders  bite)  does  not  do  so,  but  all

other effects associated with that attack apply. For example, if

an aranea subject to spiderbind cast a touch spell and then bit a

creature, the attack would deal normal bite damage and trigger

the touch spell, but the bite would not inject poison.

While you have this spell prepared, you get a +2 circumstance

bonus on saving throws against poison.

Clerics  of  Eilistraee  created  this  spell  to  help  battle  the

many spiderlike creatures that serve Lolth. Araneas, bebiliths,

chitinesMag, choldrithsMag, driders, ettercaps, myrlocharsMag, phase

spiders, retrievers, and yochlols are suf ciently spiderlike to be

affected by this spell. For a more complete list of creatures that

qualify as spiderkind, see page 30 of Underdark.

You create one twinkling star per level (maximum ten stars).

These minute starbursts orbit your head like ioun stones. As a

swift action, you can launch one star at a target you designate

within range. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch

up to three stars at one or more targets within range. You can

only launch stars once per round. You must make a ranged touch

attack for each star.

Against  non-evil  targets,  each  star  deals  1d8  points  of

nonlethal damage; evil targets take 1d8 points of lethal damage

instead.

Target: See text

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create one twinkling star per three levels (maximum  ve

stars). These minute starbursts orbit your head like ioun stones.

Beginning on the turn you cast the spell, you can launch one

star as a swift action at a target you designate within range. You

must make a ranged touch attack for each star.

Each time an evil creature is hit by a star, it must make a

saving throw or lose a prepared spell or spell slot as if the creature

had used it to cast a spell. The level of the lost spell is 4th (or

the highest spell level lower than 4th in which the caster has

at least one remaining prepared spell or spell slot). If the target

prepares spells, determine the speci c lost spell randomly. If the

creature has spellcasting ability from more than one class (such

as  a  4th-level  cleric/4th-level  ranger),  determine  the  affected

spellcasting class randomly.

The stars have no effect on nonspellcasters.

Stars of Selne

Evocation [Cold, Force]

Level: Cleric 4

Saving Throw: None

This spell functions like stars of Mystra, except as noted above

and as follows. Each star deals 1d8 points of force damage and

1d8 points of cold damage to the target.

Your  voice  is  ampli ed  greatly.  Subtract  10  from  the  DC  of

Listen checks made to hear you talking (even whispering). You

also gain a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks.

While this spell is active, you can use a swift action to create

a 15-foot-long cone-shaped burst of intense sound with a shout.

Every creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and

must succeed on a Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1

round. Doing this discharges the spell.

Creatures  that  cannot  hear  are  not  stunned  but  are  still

damaged.

CHARACTER OPTIONS

You give the target a vision of what awaits it in the afterlife. Since

most evil creatures go to an evil plane where they take the form

of a lowly and much-tortured petitioner (barring special arrange-

ments with evil gods or  ends that grant them higher status in

the afterlife), this is usually a gut-wrenching vision. The target

is nauseated; if it makes its saving throw, it is instead sickened

(see page 301 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for de nitions of

these conditions.

Sacri ce Component: 1d2 points of Strength damage.

negative level to her attack roll and damage roll. The negative

level gained by this sacri ce lasts for 24 hours, never results in

actual level loss, and cannot be overcome in any way (including

restoration spells).

This weapon ability was devised by paladins of Ilmater, and

weapons  with  this  ability  are  sometimes  called  martyrsmite

weapons.

Moderate evocation [good]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, creator must be a paladin; Price +1 bonus.

Weapon

Special Abilities

Two new weapon special abilities are introduced here.

Homeland Champion

This weapon ability invokes a mystical tie between the weapon

and a particular country (determined at the time of creation).

When the weapon is wielded by a character with the Defender of

the Homeland feat (see page 28) whose homeland matches the

weapons associated country and it is used against an evil creature

within this homeland, its enhancement bonus increases by 2 and

it  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of  damage.  Bows,  crossbows,  and

slings so crafted bestow the homeland champion quality upon

their ammunition. A hit by the weapon bestows one negative

level on any enemy of the weapons homeland. The negative level

remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the

weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in

actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including

restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.

Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Defender of the Homeland; Price +1 bonus.

Sacrificial Smiting

Only melee weapons can have this special ability. Useable only by

paladins or characters able to smite evil, this good-aligned weapon

property allows the wielder to sacri ce some of her own vitality

to gain extra uses of smite evil. By accepting one negative level,

the wielder can use smite evil on a creature struck by the weapon

even if the wielder has expended all her uses of smite evil for the

day. For example, Aelryndai Martyr-Sister is a 10th-level paladin

with 14 Charisma; even though she has expended all of her own

smite evil uses against her enemies today, she can call upon the

power of her sacri cial smiting weapon, accept a negative level,

and smite again to gain +2 on the attack roll and +9 on the damage

roll (normally +10, but 1 lower because of the negative level).

The wielder decides at the time of the attack whether to make

the sacri ce, instantly applying the effect of the smite and the

Magic Items

This section describes an assortment of magic weapons, armor,

rings, wondrous items, and artifacts of special interest to valor-

ous heroes.

Albruin

Albruin is a powerful magic sword coated in silver, which makes

it  effective  against  undead  and  lycanthropes.  It  is  intelligent,

with a mischievous personality that may drag you on unplanned

adventures. You are but the latest in a long and varied line of

wielders  who  have  ranged  from  Cormyr  to  Impiltur  to  the

Moonsea, with many adventures along the way.

History: Albruin is believed to be the creation of the long-dead

smith Surdee, who was famous in his day for the craftsmanship

of  his  work  that  came  out  of  the  forges  of  ice-bound  Glister,

where he worked ore fresh from the mines above the city on the

edge of the glacier. The blade itself evades questions about its

origins: It has no markings or de nite touches of workmanship

that identify Albruin as the work of anyone in particular.

Albruin was held for decades in the royal house of Cormyr,

kept as a family treasure but seldom (due to its alignment) borne

by the kings of that land. It was stolen from the palace at Suzail

in the Year of Daystars (1268 DR) by the thief Nypan (Nipe), a

hal ing who was soon arrested in Wheloon by soldiers of Cormyr

and slain when he attempted to escape. Nipe did not have the

blade when seized, and he did not reveal its whereabouts. It was

rumored among the thieves of that place that Nypan sold it to

a gray trader (fence) named Blusken Shult, who delivered the

sword to a waiting buyer.

The  blades  whereabouts  were  uncertain  until  the  Year  of

the Wandering Waves (1292 DR), when a lady of high birth in

Selgaunt, one Shamur Karn (later Uskreven), found the blade left

behind in her bedchamber by a visitor  eeing the city guard. He

never returned, and Shamur sold it in the Year of the Talking

Skull (1293 DR) before she disappeared. The sword was bought

by a recruiter visiting the city of Selgaunt on matters of trade

(gold for mercenaries) on behalf of Prince Thaum of Tel amm.

With his army in tow, Thaum sailed across the Easting Reach

CHARACTER OPTIONS

and sacked the city of Sarshel with complete surprise. During

the  ghting, Thaum came to covet the blade Albruin, and so the

prince had its bearer murdered in an ambush by his own men so

that Thaum could seize it for his own.

After  Thaums  death,  Albruin  was  acquired  by  Adjuz,  one

of  Thaums  warriors,  who  took  it  back  to  the  Dalelands.  He

perished at the hands of brigands along the Moonsea Ride, but

not before he had sought out the sage Elminster of Shadowdale

to ascertain its powers.

After the death of Adjuz, the trail of the sword is hidden for

some eight winters, but it is known to have been in the hands

of the mercenary general Malakar on this visit to Zhentil Keep

in the spring of the Year of the Broken Helm (1302 DR), and

was identi ed by the sage Murail of Sarbreen when a mercenary

warrior sought him out to learn the blades properties

in that city in the Year of the Catacombs (1308 DR).

Albruin has not been seen since, but Elminster is known

to have observed that its plain appearance and ability to

control  many  of  its  bearers  has  certainly  contributed  to

this anonymity.

Description: Somewhat broader in blade than a classic

longsword, Albruin gleams with the sheen of its silver coat-

ing. The blade is otherwise unremarkable, making its name

known to would-be bearers only through telepathy.

Activation: Albruin is a +3 silvered longsword. It does

not radiate light.

Effect: +3 silvered longsword; AL CN; Int 17, Wis 10,

Cha 17; Speech (Common, Elven, Undercommon, thieves

(bright illumination in a 20-foot radius, shadowy illumina-

poison 1/day (wielder only), read magic at will.

Albruin

Greater Power: Invisibility purge (30 ft. range) 3/day.

Personality: Albruin has the heart of a scamp, eternally

curious yet easily distracted and given to making mischief.

Commissioned by a Dambrathan half-drow prince who  ed

the reach of Queen Ausitil for the Great Grey Land of Thar

and sought a boon companion, the blades intended recipient never

received the sword because Albruin induced a smith at Surdees

forge to steal it away ere the prince arrived to claim his weapon.

Albruin has little interest in notoriety and seeks only wielders

who take it to a steady stream of interesting locales. Although

not heroic by nature, the sword enjoys the immediate accolades

of heroism, and is thus much more likely to prefer a good-aligned

wielder to an evil one. Albruin is most likely to exert the strength

of its personality when a mysterious ruin is in the of ng, yet its

wielders seem inclined to seek adventure elsewhere.

CHALSEMBYRS HEART

This beautiful greatsword is a unique and intelligent weapon with

ties to the temple of Torm. Sadly, it was lost, and many paladins

of The True seek it throughout Faern.

Lore:  Many  among  those  who  follow  Torm  have  long

sought  to  know  the  location  of  the  Loyal  Furys  ancient

mortal  kingdom  of  Chalsembyr.  Some  of  his  most  devout

servants  have  dedicated  their  lives  to   nding  it,  wandering

during most of their lifetimes in search of clues. One

such intrepid explorer was Bertold the Seeker, a paladin

of extraordinary dedication and sel essness. (Knowledge

[religion] DC 10)

Legend says that Bertold carried with him a greatsword

fashioned by clerics of the House of the Hand in Procampur.

This weapon, known as Chalsembyrs Heart, was designed to

assist him in his quest to  nd Chalsembyr. As it happened,

Bertold was ambushed and killed by ogres while crossing the

Toadsquat Mountains on the southern edge of the Eastern

Shaar. (Knowledge [religion] DC 15)

There  was  a  quality  the  clerics  had  imbued  in  the

weapon that Bertold did not know about. Instead of being

drawn  to  the  House  of  the  Triad  upon  his  death  as  he

had  expected,  Bertolds  soul  was  drawn  into  the  sword,

preserved  there  so  that  his  knowledge  of  Chalsembyr

would not be lost. It remained there, waiting for another

to come along and claim itand, by extension, Bertolds

knowledge. The legend suggests that should another paladin

take Chalsembyrs Heart as her own blade, she will upon

her death be destined to take Bertolds place in the sword,

 nally freeing Bertold himself to join his lord in the

House of the Triad. Each successive paladin who dies in

the service of Torm while wielding the greatsword will

similarly serve as a guide in sword form for future seekers

of Chalsembyr. (Knowledge [religion] DC 30)

Description: Chalsembyrs Heart is a greatsword masterfully

crafted of cold iron with a lion motif throughout. The iron itself

has been tinted in gold, and the point where the cross guard and

the blade meet bears a raised head of a lion face-on on one side

and in pro le on the other. The cross guards themselves appear

as lions paws, and the base of the hiltwhich is wrapped in white

leather bound in gold wireholds one large brilliant-cut white

diamond surrounded by  ve  ery yellow rectangular corundums.

The words Seek the High Seat Always in Celestial are etched

along both sides of the blade.

Dornavver is only rarely called by its true name. Most sages

and historians prefer the imagery that springs to mind when it

is referred to as Demonbane, and many tales and fragments of

lore surrounding the blade refer to it in this fashion. The sword

was  fashioned  in  the  Year  of  the  Wrath  Sword  (275  DR)  in

response to the proliferation of evil artifacts created during the

reign of the Q ysar Shoon IV of the Shoon Imperium. Relics

such as Kuraltaar the Demonshield, Jaralth the Fiendspike,

and Morthinmar the Sallet of Sorrow convinced the clergy of

Ilmater that the faith required more than just prayer to combat

the spread of evil throughout the South.

As recorded in the book Relics of the Righteous by the Sage of

the Just Gods, Thontoros the Learned, the Feast of the Moon in

Uktar of 275 DR saw a great, holy gathering at the ancient stone

circle known as Allyns Anvil, where the legendary Demonsbane

shields  had  been  consecrated  by  the  Just  God  himself  more

than two centuries before. Present were Archsufferer Irmakul

Bloodthews of Memnon, Revered Brother Filithan of Bormton

(a now-ruined village north of present-day Trademeet), Exalted

Servant Volshur the Crooked, and a host of other senior priests of

the Crying God. On that night, their fervent prayers, interspersed

with their cries of suffering, infused Dornavver with its mighty

enchantments.

The sword was entrusted to the Holy Warriors of Suffering, a

knightly order of paladins af liated with the Church of Ilmater

that at the time had its fortress at what is now known as Castle

Dasaajk, east of the Purple Hills. It is known that over one hun-

dred winters after the sword was entrusted to the Holy Warriors,

one of their number took up the blade and traveled north, coming

to the tower of Uldoon, the Mage of Fangs. The wizard Uldoon

was a ruthlesssome say insanespellhurler who consorted with

many denizens of the Lower Planes. He established the small

realm of Torsil in the lands north of the Cloud Peaks and grew

fond of summoning  ends of all types to send against rival holds

that bordered his realm, as well as the elves of Askavar, who had

their homes in nearby Glimmerwood (the present-day Wood of

Sharp Teeth). The tale of how this unnamed paladin, wielding

the mighty Dornavver, vanquished Torsil and the  ends therein

is recounted in a ballad titled Uldoons Doom, a popular song

still sung by bards of the Sword Coast today.

After the fall of Torsil, the blade known as Demonbane was

taken by its wielder west of the Heartlands and disappeared from

recorded  history  for  over  a  century.  It  is  known  that  during

the tragic procession of battles that preceded the fall of Myth

Drannor, many Dalesmen and more than a few War Wizards

of Cormyr took up arms to assist the elves and other races who

called the City of Songs home. The court records of King Draxius

the Neverdying of Cormyr recount how the ambitious Mindal

Rowanmantle, a noble younger son, gathered a ragtag army of

volunteers made up of Dalesfolk and warriors of Cormyr and

led them to  ght alongside the forces of Cormanthyr. The only

known description of this campaign is found in the diary of the

War Wizard Landraul Skatterhawk, which now rests in the Royal

Cormyrean Archives in Suzail. Landraul wrote about a blade that

 t the description of Dornavver as being in the possession of

the paladin Sarshel Elethlim and wielded by him in the Battles

of Snowsblood Trail and Standing Stones Blood during the Year

of the Firedrake (713 DR).

Sarshel Elethlim went on to lead the Triad Crusade against

the  end army that overran and despoiled Impiltur more than a

decade after the fall of Myth Drannor. Sarshel wielded Dornavver

throughout the many battles of the Fiend Wars (729732 DR)

and used it to devastating effect when he shattered the Crown of

Narfell in the Citadel of Conjurers, breaking the power of Orcus

over the last demon army and sending it into headlong retreat.

His bravery and leadership saw him crowned king of Impiltur,

and Dornavver became one of the royal blades of the kingdom.

After the death of Sarshel, Demonbane was borne, but seldom

wielded,  by  monarchs  of  the  realm,  out  of  reverence  for  the

man who had led the realm out of darkness. In the years that

followed, the sword was employed in battle only twice. In 786

DR, Prince Nord and his brothers donned all the holy regalia of

Impiltur, including the legendary Demonsbane shields, to banish

the balor Ndulu and his demon host from their realm. In that

storied battle, Nord wielded Dornavver and gained for himself

eternal glory.

The only other time that Demonbane was wielded in battle

prior to the fall of Old Impiltur in 926 DR was during the time

of King Beldred. His reign is famous for the Scouring, a year-

long campaign in the Year of the Empty Throne (850 DR) that

saw the young king lead an army of holy knights deep into the

depths of the Rawlinswood, slaying and driving forth pockets of

demons that had survived the Fiend Wars. While this campaign

averted an age-old threat to the kingdom, it unfortunately released

a horde of harried demons on the tribes of Narfell to

the north of Impiltur. The tribesmen sought

their revenge on Impiltur in the

Year  of  the  Risen  Sword  (893

DR) when they united under

the chieftain Galush and rode

forth  to  invade  the  realm

and claim, as the sage Ithy-

ran described, the warm

lands of their ancestors.

Despite  being  defeated  at

the  Battle  of  Twelvepikes

on the banks of the Soleine

River, the nomads managed

to do great damage to the outly-

ing eastern borders of the realm,

but did little to weaken the realm

proper. Their defeat and the death of their leader

saw the nomad horsemen turn tail and  ee back to the Nar

steppes, closing another chapter in Impilturs golden age.

As with all the other blades of Imbrars Royal Guard that

make up Soargars Legacy, Dornavver was safely kept by the

Mage Royal Soargar in his tower in Lyrabar until the victory

of  Imphras  the  Great  over  the  hobgoblin  hordes  in  the  Year

of the Dawndance (1095 DR) and the reestablishment of the

monarchy two years later. Most sages and historians of Impiltur

believe that King Imbrar himself wielded Demonbane when he

marched north from his lands in 1127 DR to quell the hobgoblin

menace stirring once again in the Giantspire Mountains; others

state that he gave the blade to his general and commander of

the Royal Guard, Lord Osper Wellhaven. The only thing that

the sages seem prepared to agree on is that the whereabouts and

fate of Dornavver remain a mystery that is yet to be solved.

Dornavver

Description: Dornavver  is  forged  of  some  unknown  alloy,

and its blade is multihued. The long hilt is wrapped with silver

wire and the crosspiece is also plated with this holy metal. The

pommel is etched with the symbol of Ilmater, the Broken God.

Activation: The sword is a +3 outsider bane bastard sword.

Its bane special ability functions only against evil outsiders. It

glows with a cold, blue light (equal to a light spell in effect) when

brought within 60 feet of a demon.

Effect: The bearer of the blade is rendered immune to charm

effects created by demons, and is granted a +3 bonus on all saves

against spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural abilities employed

by demons. Any demon struck by the blade must make a DC 20

Will save or be blocked from summoning others of its kind for

the next hour. Finally, the bearer of Dornavver receives Improved

Initiative as a bonus feat.

The  blade  bestows  one  negative  level  on  any  evil  creature

that holds it. The negative level remains as long as the

sword is in hand and disappears when it is no longer

carried. This negative level never results in

actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome

in any way (including restoration spells)

while the sword is held.

Demonbane  is  legendary  among

demonkind, and can be readily recog-

nized by any demon with a successful

DC 10 Knowledge (the planes) or In-

telligence check. The bearer receives

a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate

checks against demons that recognize the

blade. The attitude of any demon seeing

this  blade  immediately  shifts  to  hostile

(see  page  72  of  the  Players  Handbook)

with respect to the wielder. Most demons will

immediately communicate the swords location

and ownership to their fellows once

they learn of it.

DUKAR HAND CORAL

This living, magic coral is the legacy of the Dukars, an almost

lost order of peacekeeping aquatic wizards living in the Sea of

Fallen Stars. When implanted under the skin of the palm, it

accelerates the hosts ability to heal and helps him breathe air (if

a water-breather) or survive underwater (if an air-breather). The

Dukar wizards know how to activate other latent abilities within

the coral (see the Dukar substitution levels on page 38).

Lore: The Dukar are an order of wizards in the Sea of Fallen

Stars that tries to preserve peace between the often-hostile races

living in that body of water. (Knowledge [history] or Knowledge

[arcana] DC 20)

The wizards are known for their magical coral implants and

extreme specialization in certain schools of magic. Most of the

orders members were wiped out in some long-forgotten con ict

and only a handful remain. (Knowledge [history] or Knowledge

[arcana] DC 25).

Description: This piece of coral is about the size and shape of

a medallion, three inches across but barely thicker than a coin.

It has a convoluted texture, almost like a maze, and has many

colorspink, pale blue, yellow, and green in seemingly random

patterns.

The coral feels slightly rough and smells like saltwater. If im-

mersed in salt water, it glows faintly for a moment, then returns

to normal. The coral absorbs water if it has been dry for a long

time, then feels a little damp for days afterward.

Activation: The coral has to be implanted under the skin of

the palm to function. Cutting the hand deeply and touching the

coral to the wound is enough to make this happen (the coral pulls

itself into the wound and seals the injury shut behind it). The

Dukar normally do this as part of an initiation ceremony, but the

ceremony is not required. Once implanted, the coral immediately

starts working. The coral ejects itself automatically from a slain

creature, and the host of the coral can will it to eject itself from

his living  esh, causing 1d4 points of damage in the process and

wounding that hand (see Variant: Damage to Speci c Areas on

page  27  of  the  Dungeon Masters Guide).  The  coral  does  not

interfere with the use of that hand or magic items on the hand

or arm in any way. The palm looks normal except for a pattern

of bumps and ridges under the skin.

Effect: Implanted coral increases the hosts healing rate; add

his Hit Dice to the number of hit points per day he recovers

from resting (thus a character resting heals damage equal to his

Hit Dice  2 per day, and a person resting under long-term care

heals damage equal his Hit Dice  3 per day).

The coral slowly regenerates the hosts lost limbs and other

destroyed  tissue,  taking  1d2  days  to  regenerate  a  missing  eye

and 2d8 days to regrow a missing limb. If the hand with the

implanted coral is lost, the hosts body cannot use the corals power

to regenerate, nor can the hand regenerate an entire body. This

ability does not give the host the regeneration ability described on

page 314 of the Monster Manual (it doesnt cause most attacks

to do nonlethal damage, and so on).

The  coral  helps  an  aquatic  host  extend  how  long  he  can

breathe air. For example, an aquatic elf can normally survive

out of water for 1 hour per point of Constitution before starting

to suffocate, whilea  sahuagin can last 1 hour per 2 points of

Constitution. Treat the hosts Constitution score as 10 points

higher  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  hosts  ability  to

survive out of water (so an aquatic elf host with Constitution

10 can last 20 hours instead of 10 before starting to suffocate,

and a sahuagin host with Constitution 10 could last 10 hours

instead of 5).

The  coral  helps  an  air-breathing  host  make  better  use  of

his  air  while  holding  his  breath  underwater.  Treat  the  hosts

Constitution as 10 points higher for determining how long he

lasts before needing to make Constitution checks.

Implanted coral reacts to the presence of other hosts, glowing

eerily (light is equivalent to a candle) when it comes within 10

feet of another host creature. The Dukar use this as a symbol

of recognition, greeting each other palm-out.

Though the coral is a colony of living creatures, treat it as

an object for all game purposes.

FAITH TOKEN

A faith token is a minor magic item attuned to a particular deity.

These tokens normally bear a single cantrip or orison related to

the deitys portfolio or dogma.

Lore: Faith tokens are usually given as gifts to exceptional

members of a church or to someone who performed a signi cant

but not life-saving service. (Knowledge [religion] DC 10)

Among good churches it is customary to for a bearer to give

a faith token to another follower of his deity when he no longer

has need of it or if he  nds someone who needs it more than he

does. (Knowledge [religion] DC 15)

Description: This small piece of jewelry looks like a simple

necklace  with  a  small  charm  stamped  or  carved  with  a  holy

symbol. A faith token and its necklace can be metal, wood, bone,

or  any  material  appropriate  for  the  deity  in  question.  When

activated, a faith token can glow, make noise,  ash brightly, or

change temperature, depending on its function and its deity.

Prerequisite [optional]: A faith token only works for a wor-

shiper of the deity whose holy symbol it bears.

Activation: Faith tokens are command word activated, usually

requiring a few words of prayer (such as Ilmater protect me),

but sometimes the deitys name is suf cient.

Effect:  A  faith  token  usually  has  embedded  within  it  one

0-level spell usable twice per day. Some of them have two spells,

each usable once per day. The following are common faith token

spells associated with particular deities.

FLYING HUNT ARMOR

This dull gray armor made of glassteel (see the sidebar) is granted

to every new member of the Knights of the Flying Hunt on

Nimbral for as long as they are considered Novice Knights. It

provides magical protection from blows and also grants a soft

landing if the wearer falls from the saddle while  ying.

Lore:  This  armor  cannot  usually  be  purchased;  only  the

Nimbral Lords and certain powerful mages from Halruaa know

the secrets of its manufacture, and the Nimbral Lords typically

magically attune the armor to its designated wearer, making it

useless to anyone else. (Knowledge [arcana] DC 15)

Description: Flying hunt armor is full plate armor crafted

from glassteel, but it is tinted a dull gray color and does not glow,

as does storm armor (see below).

Prerequisite: Only characters with at least one level in the

Knight of the Flying Hunt prestige class are granted the use of

this practice armor.

Effect: Flying hunt armor is +1 glassteel full plate armor. The

armor also functions as a ring of feather falling (see page 232 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration; CL 5th.

HADRYLLIS

Hadryllis is the founding sword of Rashemen, wielded by the hero

Yvengi to drive the scourge of Nar-summoned demons from the

land. The legendary Bane of Eltab, as it is also known, is said to

be capable of expunging the curse of the Demonlands from the

nations that border the Easting Reach.

History: Hadryllis is the legendary magical blade of Yvengi.

With the aid of Hadryllis, the half-Rus/half-Rashemi hero liber-

ated Rashemen from the rule of Eltab, the Lord of the Hidden

Layer,  in  the  Year  of  Leather  Shields  (75  DR),  driving  the

demon prince and his minions from the land.

The origins of Hadryllis are lost in the mist of time, but it

appears to be of Raumathari origin, suggesting it was given to

Yvengi by the wychlaranUna, commonly known as the Witches

of Rashemen, a secret sisterhood formed in the dying days of

Raumathar to preserve that empires magical lore. The blade may

Glassteel

Made by the avariels and sun elves in an alchemical process

requiring extensive knowledge of both metallurgy and glass-

blowing,  glassteel  combines  strength  beyond  iron  with  the

transparency of glass. It mostly  nds use as a building material

in fantastic castles, but it can also be fashioned into weapons

and armor (although glassteel armor is much more costly to

craft than even the most ornate blade). Glassteel is stronger

and lighter than iron and completely transparent, lacking the

greenish tint of common glass.

Items made of glassteel weigh only half what they otherwise

would. Items not primarily made of metal are not meaningfully

affected by being partially made of glassteel. (A breastplate can

be made of glassteel, but hide armor cannot.)

Glassteel armor counts as one armor category lighter than

normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy

65

armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as

light, but light armors are still treated as light. Arcane spell failure

chances for armors and shields made of glassteel are decreased by

10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor

check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).

Glassteel has hardness 20 and 40 hit points per inch of

thickness.  Weapons  and  armor  fashioned  from  glassteel  are

treated  as  masterwork  items  with  regard  to  creation  times,

but the masterwork quality does not affect the enhancement

bonus of weapons nor the armor check penalty of armor.

Item Cost Modi er: light armor +2,000 gp, medium armor

+6,000 gp, heavy armor +12,000 gp, shield +2,000 gp, weapon

+500 gp, other items +100 gp/lb.

This description updates and supersedes previous descriptions

of glassteel.

have been forged by the  rst vremyonniUna, commonly known

as Old Ones, male Rashemi arcane spellcasters who specialize

in the creation of magic items. Lending some credence to this

belief, the vremyonni speak of a great blade forged by the gods

and given to the captain of Raumathars armies to shatter the

most unholy working of the Nar demonbinders.

After Eltabs defeat, a succession of Iron Lords of Rashemen

wielded Hadryllis as the Rashemi sword of state. The sword was

lost during the rebellion of Bregg the Strong (189194 DR),

who fomented an insurrection against the wychlaran after they

refused to name him Iron Lord. The blade brie y reappeared

in the markets of KenstenLE (now Bezantur) several years later,

only to be purchased by a cleric of Anhur and brought back to

the Mulhorandi city of Sultim.

An  incarnation  of  Anhur  used  the  sword  to  great  effect

during the War of Claws (202204 DR), an ill-fated invasion of

southern Unther and Mulhorand by the Arkaiuns of Eltabranar.

Eltab was defeated on the  eld of battle and imprisoned beneath

the Thaymount through the use of the weapons magic.

After the war, Hadryllis was returned to the Blood Fortress

of Sultim , where the church of Anhur believes it remains, hidden

away in an ancient subterranean armory in case Mulhorand  nds

cause to defend itself against the machinations of Eltab once again.

In truth, the sword was stolen several centuries ago by the witches

of Rashemen and has been replaced by an excellent forgery.

Since returning to Rashemen, Hadryllis has been held by a

succession of Iron Lords, but none have wielded it openly, because

the wychlaran have instructed them to keep it hidden in reserve

in case Eltab ever returned. In the Year of the Shield (1367 DR),

after an earthquake wracked the Thayan city of Eltabbar, the

wychlaran detected Eltabs escape from his Zulkir-constructed

prison. The wychlaran then instructed the reigning Iron Lord

to give Hadryllis to a band of adventurers who had just stopped

an  invasion  of  Rashemen  by  Thay.  The  adventurers  used  the

blade to defeat Szass Tams plot to bind Eltab to the Thaksorils

seat with the nine Runes of Chaos, but the Lord of the Hidden

Layer escaped as a result. Although the adventurers are believed

to have also survived the battle, neither they nor Szass Tam are

believed to still have the sword.

Description:  This  powerful  cold  iron  blade  is  masterfully

forged and adorned with Raumviran runes along both sides of the

blade, spelling out its name. The hilt is wrapped with aughisky

hide, from a rare equine monster found in the icy waters of Lake

Ashane.

Activation:  Hadryllis  is  a  +3  outsider  bane  holy  cold  iron

greatsword. Its bane special ability functions only against evil

outsiders. It glows (equal to a light spell in effect) when drawn.

Effect: AL CG; Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 17; Speech (Common,

Lesser Powers: Blindness 3/day (struck target only), detect

magic at will, bulls strength 3/day (wielder only).

Greater Power: Invisibility purge (30 ft. range) 3/day.

Special  Purpose:  Defeat/slay  evil  outsiders,  speci cally

Eltab.

Dedicated Power: Hadryllis has the unique property of being

able to shatter the Adamantine Binding  that lies in the depths

of the Citadel of Conjurers, a legendary Narfelli ruin near the

mouth of the Moaning Gorge in Impiltur. This unique binding

tethers both Eltab and the scattered demoncysts (tiny pockets of

the 248th layer of the Abyss) to the Demonlands of Faern.

Personality: Hadryllis is consumed with its calling, urging its

wielder into battle with any  end that presents itself, to the point

of attempting to dominate any wielder who turns aside from such

a battle. The sword is sullen and withdrawn when its hated foes are

not present, seeing little point to battling mindless monsters.

HARPER TOKEN

The Harpers have many friends and allies, and sometimes they

reward people who have done them a service. They also like to

mark their friends and loved ones so that other Harpers know to

look out for them. A Harper token is a minor magic item that

gives the bearer a small bene t and lets the Harpers identify

him. Such items are often carried by the adventuring sons and

daughters of Harpers.

Description: This small brooch is made of silver. Its head is

a  at disk embossed with a handharp. Some Harper tokens are

made of gold or other materials, have different embossed symbols

such as a musical note or a tree, and come in other shapes such

as belt buckles, bracelets, or rings.

When its power is used, a Harper token glows slightly, becomes

warm, buzzes softly, or gives some other small signal that it is

functioning. This signal is never contrary to the purpose of the

item; for example, a token that gives a bonus on Hide checks

would never glow, and one that helps Move Silently checks would

not make noise.

Activation:  A  Harper  token  requires  a  command  word  to

activate it once it is worn, but once activated it continues to func-

tion as long as it is worn; removing it ends its bene t until it is

donned and the command word spoken once again. The command

words are phrases made up of words that would never be spoken

together, such as blessed Zhentarim, friendly phaerimm, or

drunken golem. Harper tokens do not work for evil creatures.

Effect: A Harper token provides a +2 competence bonus on a

single skill, such as Climb, Diplomacy, Hide, Knowledge (arcana),

or Perform (sing). The particular skill of each Harper token is

usually chosen based on the needs of the person wearing it. For

example, a Harper whose son was prone to blunt speech might

give him a token that adds +2 to his Diplomacy checks.

If a Harper token and a Harper pin (see page 159 of Magic

of Faern) of any kind touch, the token glows momentarily. This

property allows Harpers to verify if a token is actually a Harper

item or just something that looks like one.

OATH-HAMMER

This dwarven warhammer gains additional power if its wielder

swears an oath to destroy an enemy who has wronged him. It

extracts a price if the wielder fails to avenge himself or if he

wastes its power on trivial challenges.

Lore:  Created  by  a  dwarf  priest  who  lost  his  two  sons  in

an attack by the drow, Oath-Hammer was his way of bringing

vengeance to the dark elves. (Knowledge [history] DC 15)

He made a vow of silence and battled the drow for a year

before they managed to kill him (Knowledge [history] DC 20)

The hammer was traded to a duergar merchant and hasnt

been seen since. (Knowledge [history] DC 25)

Description: This dwarf-crafted warhammer even looks angry;

the shape of its head and the slant of its inscription in Dwarven

indicate a simmering rage in its creator that endured during the

entire time it was forged and crafted.

The Dwarven script reads: For my sons, Khondar and Khon-

dos Stonebreaker, slain at the hands of the dark elves, whose spilt

blood I will avenge a hundredfold before I die, so I swear before

the faces of Moradin, Berronar, and Gorm.

When wielded, the weapon radiates a faint feeling of restrained

anger. When its vengeance powers are activated, this emotion

escalates to a seething hate that pours off the hammer like a

blistering heat and lightens its weight so it feels feather-light in

its wielders hand.

Activation:  To  activate  the  hammers  special  powers,  the

wielder must swear an oath in Dwarven (repeating it phonetically

from another person if the wielder doesnt speak Dwarven) to

uphold a sacred vow until some speci ed act of vengeance is

completed. The wielder must state the nature of the necessary

act (such as Kill the man who murdered my parents), and

achieving this revenge must be a good act (an evil character

cannot use the hammers special powers to gain revenge on good

heroes); otherwise the attempt fails. The special powers end if the

conditions of the vengeance are met, or if the wielder abandons

his task, or dies. The hammer can only enforce one oath at a

time, and cannot accept a new oath until the previous one is

ful lled or abandoned, or the previous oathmaker dies or gives

up the hammer.

Effect: Oath-Hammer is normally a +2 warhammer. If acti-

vated by swearing an oath, it becomes a +5 warhammer, deals an

extra 2d6 points of damage, and its critical multiplier increases

to 4; these improvements only apply against creatures directly

associated with the wielders path of vengeance. Against all other

creatures,  the  activated  hammer  functions  like  a  masterwork

weapon without any enhancement bonuses.

As stated earlier, for the wielder to activate the weapon, he

must  take  a  sacred  vow  and  uphold  it  until  his  vengeance  is

complete. Vows of abstinence, chastity, and purity are suitable

vows, all of which are presented as feats in Book of Exalted Deeds;

choosing one of these vows also provides the bene t associated

with that feat. Other possible vows include silence, never smiling

or laughing, eating only bread and water, and so on; these sorts

of  vows  provide  no  game  bene ts  other  than  activating  the

hammers increased power.

When  the  wielder  achieves  his  righteous  vengeance,  the

hammer  once  again  becomes  a  +2  warhammer.  The  wielder

immediately  gains  one  negative  level.  If  the  widelder  breaks

his  oath  or  abandons  his  quest  for  vengeance,  the  hammer

temporarily loses all its magical bonuses and the wielder gains

two negative levels.

RELUCTANT FOUR

This  weapon  thrums  with  power  and  goodness.  Markings  in

the  Celestial  language  describe  its  abilities,  command  words,

and purpose. All of its powers are nonlethal but some are quite

capable of defeating multiple enemies and are intended to defeat

good enemies without causing lasting harm.

Lore: Hundreds of years ago, four allied members of several

good Faernian churches feared that Bane and other evil deities

might  somehow  turn  the  good  churches  and  countries  of  the

world against each other. The allies created four magic weapons

imbued with the ability to subdue opponents without harm, hoping

that these weapons would allow saner heads to bring about peace

without loss of life. These weapons are called the Reluctant Four,

named for their creators reluctance to ever see good  ghting

good. (Knowledge [history] DC 20)

After  the  weapons  were   nished,  the  allies  magically  hid

them, tying them with invisible spells that would bring them out

of hiding when they were needed and put them in the hands of

those who could set things right. (Knowledge [history] DC 25)

In the past few years, two of the weapons have been sighted;

diplomats worry that this foretells armed strife between good

governments and faiths, but some believe that wild magic during

the Time of Troubles damaged the hiding-spells, which have since

unraveled and some of the weapons have been found. (Knowledge

[history] DC 30)

Description: The Reluctant Four are different weapons but

have  common  elements  in  their  appearance.  All  of  them  are

made of light-colored materials, whether bright steel or pale wood.

All bear inscriptions in Celestial giving the weapons name, its

powers, and the purpose of all four weapons; anyone holding the

weapon automatically understands the writing and knows that it

is written in Celestial.

Anvil of Hope: This dwarven warhammer has mithral inlays

on its head in the shape of a hammer and anvil. Its handle is

wrapped  in  ghost  roth  leather.  When  the  hammers  powers

are active, the mithral inlays shine like a forge and the weapon

whispers a Dwarven chant.

Lady Justice: This longsword has a pristine leather-wrapped

hilt. The crossguard is engraved with a small abstract symbol

of a pair of balanced scales. When its powers are active, the

sword glows with a bronzelike color and the blade rings like a

bell when struck.

Lord  of  Sleep:  This   ne  elven  longbow  has  a  string  that

sometimes appears to be silver and at other times looks no more

substantial than dust in a sunbeam. Where the bearers  ngers

would  hold  the  bow  are  four  crescent  moon  symbols,  one  for

each  nger. When its powers are active, the bow emits a soothing

warmth and seems to hum to itself in an Elven tune.

Maid  of  the  Waters:  This  quarterstaff  looks  more  like  a

walking stick than a weapon, since it is thicker on one end and

somewhat gnarled around a smooth place where a walker would

hold it. Running on one side for the entire length of the staff is

a stylized waterfall, emptying into a carving of a pool that circles

the entire bottom of the staff. When its powers are active, the

waterfall engraving slowly leaks cool, clean water and the staff

smells like a fresh patch of clover.

Prerequisite: Only creatures that have one or more exalted

feats (see page 26) can use these weapons without penalty. The

weapons bestow one negative level on any other good or neutral

creature that tries to use them. They bestow two negative levels

on any evil creature that tries to use them. The negative level

or levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear

when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never

result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any

way  (including  restoration  spells)  while  the  weapon  is  wielded.

None of the magical properties of the weapons function in the

hands of an evil creature (including granting the ability to read

the Celestial writing on the weapon).

Activation: All of the powers of the weapons are command

word activated. Since the command words are written on each

weapon, any non-evil creature can use a particular weapon by

invoking its command word.

Effect:  Each  of  the  Reluctant  Four  is  a  +1  mercifulMag

weapon with unique properties. Three of them appear to have a

rudimentary personality, though no records exist of the weapons

actually  communicating  with  anyone;  it  is  more  a  feeling  or

understanding on the part of the wielder that the weapon is more

than an object.

Anvil  of  Hope  is  designed  to  prevent  good  dwarves  from

harming each other. It can produce a good hope effect once per

day. It emits a 60-foot aura that only affects good dwarves; any

such opponent within the aura must make a DC 11 Will save

or leave the battle to think for the next hour about why he is

 ghting and if the battle serves the purpose of good and the

dwarf race as a whole. Affected dwarves stop attacking and leave

the battle in the safest way possible; if the wielder or his allies

attacks an affected dwarf during this time, the effect on that

dwarf immediately ends. A dwarf who makes his saving throw

against this effect is immune to it for the next 24 hours. This

weapon does not seem to have a personality.

Lady Justice is designed to free opponents from magic that

forces them to  ght or makes them believe the wielder is their

enemy. If the wielders opponent is under the effect of such magic

(including charm spells cast by the wielders enemies and confusion

spells causing the target to attack the nearest creature), hitting

the opponent with the sword lets the wielder try to dispel it by

making  a  caster  level  check  (d20+10)  against  the  caster  level

of the controlling magic. This ability can be used at will. Lady

Justice radiates a protective aura in a 20-foot radius that gives

creatures  in  the  area  a  +4  resistance  bonus  on  saving  throws

against mind-affecting spells and abilities. Lady Justice has a

stern female personality; her wielder senses when she is displeased

by some apparent failing he has exhibited.

Lord of Sleep is designed to quickly disable opponents before

they can sound an alarm or endanger others. While the bow can

 re arrows normally, the wielder can also use it to  re rays of

light that cause a target with 4 HD or less to make a DC 11 Will

save or fall asleep for 10 minutes as if affected by a sleep spell.

The bow can  re up to  ve of these arrows per round (subject

to the number of attacks the wielder can make per round). Once

per day it can produce a solid fog effect. Lord of Sleep has an

older male personality, conveying a grandfatherly sort of feeling,

and his wielder senses when the bow is trying to steer him toward

or away from a particular course of action.

Maid  of  the  Waters  is  designed  to  quickly  end  hostilities

and get people talking again. The staff radiates a calm emotions

effect;  a  creature  that  saves  against  this  effect  is  immune  to

it for 24 hours thereafter. Once per day the staff can twist to

form a symbol of persuasion; all creatures affected by the symbol

view the wielder as a friend and impartial speaker. If the wielder

STORM ARMOR

When a member of the Knights of the Flying Hunt attains full

Knighthood (gains three levels in the prestige class), the Nimbral

Lords bestow upon that character a suit of this famous glowing

glass armor of legend.

Lore:  This  armor  cannot  usually  be  purchased;  only  the

Nimbral Lords and certain powerful mages from Halruaa know

the secrets of its manufacture, and the Nimbral Lords typically

magically  attune  the  armor  to  its  designated

wearer,  making  it  useless  to  anyone  else.

(Knowledge [arcana] DC 15)

Description:  Storm  armor  is  full

plate armor crafted from glassteel (see

page  65)  that  has  further  been  enhanced

to  glow  brightly  in  various  hues  of  the

rainbow, the shades of which are controlled

by the wearer. They gain brightness as the

wearers rage or excitement increases, and

they become dimmer as consciousness or

physical vitality fails.

Prerequisite:  Only  characters  with

at least three levels in the Knight of the

Flying Hunt prestige class are granted the use

of this legendary armor.

Effect:  Storm  armor  is  +1  glassteel  full  plate

armor of invulnerability and electricity resistance.

The armor also functions as a ring of feather falling

(see page 232 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Aura/Caster  Level:  Moderate  abjuration.

CL 9th.

Construction: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

feather fall, dancing lights, 29,150 gp, 1,480 XP,

Variants:  Faithful  service  and  outstanding

performance by a Knight of the Flying Hunt can

earn him the rank of Commander (ten levels of

the prestige class) and more magic augmentations to

his storm armor, making it greater storm armor. See the Knight

of the Flying Hunt prestige class (page 106) for details.

by  an  equilateral  triangle-front

having one point at the belt, the

other two giving the wearer wide,

impressive shoulders.

daerazylym, the steel dragon leader of the Soft Claws mercenaries

Description: All of Zundaerazylyms nevertokens appear as

identical, glossy smooth, silvery blue, four-pointed metal stars.

Each is 1 inch thick and about 4 inches across from point to point.

They are lighter than their volume suggests, pierced in

the center to allow a neck chain or keepstrap to be

passed through them, and their points and edges are

rolled and blunt. They are constructed of an unknown

alloy that is extremely durable and resistant to damage.

In fact, its hard to mark a nevertoken with anything short

of a forge hammer; when broken, a token typically bursts

into a harmless  aring  ame and falls to dust in seconds. All

nevertokens are protected by a blueshineMag treatment and all

emit a pleasant four-tone metallic chord, like a quartet of

Minor Artifact

Artifacts are powerful, unique, purpose-built magic items, the

spawn of dozens of lost civilizations and empires. They should

be  treated  with  extreme  care,  because  their  abilities  are  of  a

magnitude higher than that of a more mundane magic item.

CROWN OF NARFELL

An ancient crown bearing this name and possessed of sinister

powers was once worn by the legendary Nentyarch of Narfell.

After that evil item was destroyed, its pieces were reforged by

the gods of the Triad as a potent symbol of Impilturs refusal to

bow to the armies of the Abyss. The new Crown of Narfell is

imbued with powers that advance the cause of good and law. At

present, it is the royal crown of Impiltur.

History:  In  970  DR,  the  reigning  Nentyarch  (king)  of

Tharos constructed the great tree-lined fortress of Dun-Tharos in

the heart of the present-day Rawlinswood near the headwaters of

the Soleine River. Some attribute his rise to the acquisition of a

fell artifact that came to be known as the Crown of Narfell, while

others claim it came about due to a combination of fortuitous

events and personal magnetism. Although the true origin of the

Crown may never be known, it is thought that Orcus, the Demon

Prince of Undead, gave the headpiece to the Nentyarch as part of

a dark pact. In any event, after proclaiming the empire of Narfell

and donning the Crown of Narfell, the Nentyarch proceeded to

conquer one petty kingdom of the Nars after another, the last

of which was the kingdom of Ashanath. The Nentyarchs army

literally wiped out Ashanaths capital city, Shandaular, reducing

it to little more than myth and scattered piles of rubble along

the western shore of Lake Ashane. By 900 DR, the empire of

Narfell  stretched  from  the  uplands  of  Impiltur  to  Ashanath

and from the eastern slopes of the Giantspire Mountains to the

northern bank of the River Umber.

In the centuries that followed, Narfells rulers set their sights

on the Priador Plateau (now the Plateau of Thay), home once

again only to nomadic tribes of centaurs and gnolls following the

retreat of Mulhorand. Realizing that the empire of Raumathar

to the east had similar designs, successive Nentyarchs pursued

a  two-pronged  policy  of  endless  skirmishing  and  settlement.

The tribal lands of the Rashemi lay between Lake Ashane and

the  Sunrise  Mountains,  bordered  to  the  north  and  south  by

Raumathar  and  the  plateau.  While  Narfelli  settlers  streamed

south and east to claim the territory, the Nentyarchs armies

bottled up Raumathars forces in Rashemen, pitting the barbaric

Rashemi against each other and against the armies of Raumathar.

Early successes by Narfell that extended the empires reach to

the northern shore of the Alamber Sea were reversed after 623

DR  because  of  an  ill-conceived  invasion  of  Mulhorand  and  a

surprise  attack  by  Raumathars  army.  In  order  to  reverse  the

empires decline, the ruling class of Narfell was forced to turn

to demonic aid to learn the art of sorcery, prompted by the fell

whisperings of the Crown of Narfell. In 150 DR, centuries of

warfare culminated in a great con agration that consumed both

empires and left all manner of summoned beings to stalk the

lands they once ruled.

In the Crowns early days, its powers were relatively benign,

extracting a dark price from the bearer only upon his death. Those

who dared call upon the powers of the Crown found their souls

absorbed into the Crown at death and their bodies transformed

into crown-wraiths. By 150 DR, however, the Crown of Narfell

had grown powerful indeed, and its evil persuasiveness almost

certainly turned the Narfelli court toward consorting with  ends

and ruled the heart of a succession of Nentyarchs.

For centuries after the fall of Narfell, the Crown of Narfell

was one of many Narfelli artifacts forgotten in the depths of

the Citadel of Conjurers, located north of the Hill of Tombs.

It is unclear whether the last Nentyarch to rule Narfell died

in the catacombs beneath the Citadel of Conjurers, or if the

Crown  was  placed  there  after  his  death.  In  any  case,  after

Impilturan explorers awoke the long-slumbering  ends beneath

the Rawlinswood and Forest of Lethyr, a powerful balor named

Ndulu gathered a host of demons and marched directly toward

the Citadel of Conjurers. Some claim the balor was guided by

the hand of Orcus, while others claim Ndulu simply sought the

artifacts  within  to  claim  their  power  for  himself.  Whatever

the   ends  motivation,  his  ambitions  were  halted  when  the

paladin Sarshel entered the Citadel and shattered the Crown

of Narfell in the Year of Visions (731 DR). The destruction

of the artifact somehow broke the back of the demon army,

enabling the defenders of Impiltur to prevail.

Although Sarshel gathered up all the physical pieces of the

Crown,  the  crown-wraiths  escaped,  and  with  them  went  the

darkness  that  had  beset  the  artifact.  High  priests  of  Ilmater,

Torm, and Tyr collaborated to reforge the physical crown into a

shining beacon of justice, truth, and mercy, while Ndulu corralled

the crown-wraiths to forge a shadow crown, later known as the

Moaning Crown of Ndulu.

The reforged Crown of Narfell has served as part of Impilturs

regalia since Sarshel was crowned in the Year of the Proud Father

(732 DR). After the royal family died out in the Year of the

Fearless Peasant (926 DR), it was for a time the focus of battles

between Impilturs rival noble houses. Eventually Soargar, Mage

Royal of Impiltur, took the Crown of Narfell and other treasures

of the realm to his tower in Lyrabar, to await the day that the

monarchy would be restored. After being told of its location by

Redeemed Items

Book  of  Exalted  Deeds  describes  how

good characters can transform evil magic

items into objects suitable for use by crea-

Faernian evil items redeemed to good.

Doomwarden Bracers: This item was

redeemed by the church of Kelemvor in

conjunction with a dragon-priest of Torm.

These bracers of armor +3 were carved from

the bones of a good-aligned dragon, plated with silver, and inlaid

with  at onyx tiles forming a mosaic in the shape of a pair of

scales. The bracers allow the wearer to use death ward, consecrate,

and holy smite each once per day. They bestow one negative level

on any evil creature that wears them. The negative level remains

as long as the bracers are worn and disappears when they are no

longer carried. This negative level never results in actual level

loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration

spells) while the bracers are worn.

Cults,  guilds,  and  organizations  are  scattered

across Faern. From the tiniest, most localized

gangs to the broadest reaching institutions, they

are part and parcel of the land. Some are localized, tucked into

the remotest out-of-the-way corners, while others have impres-

sive forti cations at every crossroads and fancy halls in every

major city.

Most such groups are by nature congenial, working to bene t

their members while at the same time providing valuable services

to the communities in which they reside. Craftsmen, performers,

and merchants most often come together to form such organiza-

tions, gaining strength in numbers across political and mercantile

boundaries. They can control prices, in uence political leadership,

even oppose rival groups. But by and large, they are a boon to

their local communities; life for the common folk would be far

more dif cult without them.

Many  more  groups  serve  only  themselves,  seeking  sel sh

bene ts  or  even  outright  destruction  of  others  through  their

actions and plots. They are nefarious and dangerous, whether they

move in shadow, avoiding public scrutiny, or stride boldly down

the middle of the avenue, proclaiming their superiority over all

others. They are the champions of ruin, and countless lives lie

broken and destroyed in their wake.

Then there are those who stand for what is right, who espouse

the  cause  of  goodness  and  honor.  They  defend  the  weak  who

cannot defend themselves,  ght against evil in its many forms,

and  honor  their  deities  through  sel ess  heroism  and  willing

sacri ce. These are the true champions of valor.

What Makes an

Organization

Valorous?

Many organizations could be considered good. Not all are valor-

ous. To truly uphold the concepts of noble heroism and generous

spirit, a group of individuals must come together for a common

good that goes far beyond their own needs. The members must

be sel ess, more intent on easing the trials and tribulations of

others  than  feathering  their  own  nests.  They  must  be  brave,

ready  to  face  challenges  that  might  seem  overwhelming  and

possibly  deadly,  if  for  no  other  reason  than  because  someone

has to do it. They must be forthright and honest, willing and

eager  to  proclaim  their  beliefs  and  goals  without  any  hint  of

subterfuge  and  deception.  And  they  must  be  cognizant  that

walking the straight and narrow path of goodness is not always

a cut-and-dried issue. Too many groups suffer the sins of pride

and stubbornness, believing that they understand the one true

path of righteousness and valor, all the while never realizing that

those they oppose are just as kind-hearted, generous, and sel ess

as they. The ability to recognize ones own shortcomings, as well

as the ability to change course and adjust methods, separate the

truly valorous organizations from those who merely use the term

as a justi cation for furthering their own ends.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

Not Every Organization

Qualifies

Countless organizations within Faern see themselves as righteous,

justi ed, and valorous in what they do, yet they do not truly

demonstrate the ideals and qualities necessary to be considered

such. These groups claim to work for the common good, indeed

are often thought of by those they support as noble and valorous,

yet for some reason or another do not measure up.

Some  groups  may  attempt  to  help  those  less  able  to  help

themselves but simply cannot allow for the possibility that other

methods, other organizations are equally as dedicated to similar

ideals. Others might have all the right intentions, be willing to

reexamine their own choices with a critical eye, and yet take little

real action. Still others seem wholly bene cent on the surface,

but at the end of the day, their efforts bene t themselves most

of all.

Some groups that many might expect to see in this section do

not appear in more detail for the reasons mentioned above. The

Emerald Enclave, for example, is by far the best known of the

druid groups in Faern, but under careful scrutiny, its obvious

that the groups militaristic attitude and uncompromising opposi-

tion to most urban civilization precludes it from consideration.

Likewise, the Lords Alliance is a noble and worthwhile gathering

of good-hearted individuals for a just purpose, but in and of itself

the group does not engage in truly valorous enterprises. Negotia-

tion of treaties and vows of mutual assistance are not quite the

same as defending a sacred glade from demons or freeing recently

captured slaves from their oppressors.

On a related note, a number of other organizations would

ordinarily qualify for inclusion in this supplement, but are already

detailed elsewhere. Numerous noble groups in and around the

Waterdeep region are described in City of Splendors: Waterdeep;

other groups have appeared recently in similar works, such as

the Circle of Leth in Unapproachable East. Finally, though the

Harpers are perhaps the most well known of any good-aligned

organization known in Faern, they have been thoroughly and

extensively covered in several other sources, and the DM who

wishes to include them should consult those works.

Valorous

Organizations

Each of the groups detailed in this chapter  ts the mold of a

valorous organization. They represent a mere sampling of pos-

sibilities across numerous facets of examination. Each one was

chosen for its appeal to a different group of character classes, a

different region of Faern, and a different level of in uence and

prestige. They are by no means an exhaustive collection, and any

of them can serve as models for other groups the DM might

wish to develop for his own campaign.

The Druids of

Tall Trees

The druids of Tall Trees are a reclusive and secretive group of

servants  of  Eldath,  Mielikki,  and  Silvanus  who  dwell  in  the

northeastern portion of the High Forest, among some of the

grandest  trees  in  all  of  Faern.  They  live  within  the  ancient

Eaerlanni community of Tall Treesknown originally (and also

referred to nowadays) as Teuveamanthaarand act as caretakers

to the colossal trees that grow there. In addition to their tireless

work  nurturing  the   ora  and  fauna  in  the  region,  they  have

dedicated themselves to preserving the remnants of the ancient

elven homeland of Eaerlann from the depredations of various

75

grasping  factions.  Their  enemies,  always  ambitious  for  wealth

and  power,  often  seek  treasure  and  lore  within  the  protected

realm. The druids must therefore devote a good deal of their

time and energy to repelling such excursions, relying on the aid

of trustworthy agents to prevail.

History

From its founding  in 4,550 DR, the elven tree-city of Teu-

veamanthaar was the capital and largest city of Eaerlann,

the  moon  elf  realm  that  lay  within  the  northern  and

eastern reaches of the High Forest among the ruins of

Aryvandaar.  Built  atop  a  steep-sided

ridge,  Teuveamanthaar  was  known

for  its  soaring  oak  trees,  which

towered over the rest of the forest like hill

giants to human youths and whose trunks

were said to be the width of most northern

human  villages.  The  inhabitants  of  Teu-

veamanthaar  created  fabulous  dwellings

from hollows painstakingly shaped into the

trunks and branches of these great trees as

they grew, creating a city high above the

forest  oor, linked by a network of magi-

cally warded and preserved rope bridges.

In the Year of the Curse (882 DR), trag-

edy  struck the realm of Eaerlann. Human

refugees from the fallen empire of Neth-

eril had long dwelt behind the walls of the

fortress of Ascalhorn at the invitation of

the elves. Now, foolish pride and the subtle

manipulations  of  feyri  agents  led  some

among them to lose control of numerous

summoned  ends, as well as portals to the

lower planes. A horde of demons and dev-

ils swarmed through the city, slaying one

another along with nearly all others within. At the end of the

day, Ascalhorn was in the control of tanarri, and once that oc-

curred, nothing remained to stop orcs from invading the interior

of Eaerlann. The elves put up a stout defense for several months,

but the fall of their realm was a foregone conclusion, and even-

tually they began to migrate away. The fall of Eaerlann thus led

to the abandonment of Teuveamanthaar, which almost certainly

would have been overrun by humanoids but for prompt action

by a handful of followers of Mielikki.

Originally from Ascalhorn, these druids had left behind the

trappings of urban life in favor of the rural existence offered to

them beneath the branches of the High Forest. They had come

to Teuveamanthaar to study the lore of the forest with the elves,

becoming  attuned  to  nature  in  ways  the  people  of  Ascalhorn

would never understand. As disaster struck and the elves chose

to depart, the druids, saddened by the loss of their mentors but

determined  to  see  the  fair  folks  works  left  undisturbed,  took

refuge  in  the  abandoned  tree-city  in  the  same  chambers  the

original elves crafted, though they occupied only a tiny fraction

of the abandoned remnants of Teuveamanthaar. They prevented

Teuveamanthaar from falling into the clutches of both the orcs

swarming out of the Nether Mountains and the demons pour-

ing forth from the city of Ascalhorn, which eventually became

known as Hellgate Keep.

Since  that  time,  druids  have  been  continuously  present  in

Teuveamanthaar, taking refuge within the bowers of the great

oaks and protecting and nurturing the massive trees. For  ve

hundred years, the woodfolk have on repeated occasions driven

off concerted attacks by orc hordes and demon-led ghoul packs, as

well as the occasional band of adventurers seeking treasure in the

forgotten places the elves left behind. In recent years, the threats

against the druids and their tree-city have grown more varied, as

members of House Dlardrageth and the Eldreth Veluuthra (see

Champions of Ruin) have become active in the High Forest.

The Druids Today

For nearly  ve hundred years, the druids remained little changed

from their origins as an organization. Only recently have they

been forced to adjust their lifestyle and purpose, shifting their

aims and goals to accommodate the elves of Caerilcarn, who have

returned  to live in Teuveamanthaar and thereby help establish

New Eaerlann. The elves have thus far recognized the comrade-

ship  and  value  of  the  druids  and  have  asked  them  to  remain

within the city, dwelling side by side with the newcomers. For

their part, the druids are delighted with such an arrangement,

for it both justi es their long years of care on behalf of the elves

and it gives them the wherewithal to do even more to preserve

the High Forest.

The druids number some two dozen proper members, with a

nearly equal number of assistants, associates, and allies coming

and going from time to time. The membership consists mostly

of senior druids of Mielikki, though representatives of Eldath

and Silvanus are present and welcome, too. In addition to the

druids themselves, the group includes a number of rangers who

serve as scouts and muscle in times of need, as well as a hand-

ful of trusted individuals with other useful talents, including

spellcasting folk.

Once a very secluded, secretive lot, the druids of Tall Trees

have had to change their private ways somewhat with the ar-

rival of the new elf residents. Visitors from beyond the borders

of the High Forest have been much more prevalent within

the  city  during  the  last  several  months,  forcing  the  druids

to interact with strangers more frequently. Though many of

the most senior members have been forced to overcome their

reclusive  natures,  this  interaction  has  had  a  positive  effect

on the druids, too, for their numbers have swelled with new

potential members and agents.

Of  particular  interest  is  the  tree-city  itself.  The  chambers

that make up the ancient settlement are largely unchanged from

the day their original elf inhabitants departed for lands to the

south and west. Although the Fair Folk of Eaerlann took nearly

everything  of  consequence  with  them  when  Teuveamanthaar

was abandoned, a few valuable items (magical and nonmagical

alike) were left behind. Those that the druids themselves located

during the previous  ve centuries were carefully stored away and

protected, and now, when the elves have chosen to return, many

wondrous treasures are back in elf hands.

The city is quite well protected from hostile forces. Only a

handful of rope ladders lead down to the ground, and they are

normally drawn up into the trees. Ancient wards dating back to

the earliest days of Eaerlann still protect the Tall Trees settle-

ment from magical and nonmagical  re, the danger of lightning

strikes, and the threat of rot and disease. Tall Trees has begun

to bustle with activity once more.

The Druids Foes

The forces opposed to the druids of Tall Trees are numerous and

varied; a handful are of particular note, either because of their

proximity, their speci c enmity toward the druids, or both. Those

mentioned below are by no means an exhaustive list, however.

Numerous other forces have from time to time run afoul of the

druids and caused them considerable consternation.

Perhaps the most antagonistic foes to square off against the

druids  of  Teuveamanthaar  are  the  demons  of  Hellgate  Keep.

Those  ends were most responsible for the downfall of Eaerlann

in the  rst place, and they have certainly created more havoc

and hardship for the druids than any other enemy. Though the

ruins of ancient Ascalhorn are now nothing more than a rapidly

disappearing dale, swallowed up by the tender ministrations of

Turlang the treant, some believe that demons still dwell deep

beneath the surface of Hellgate Dell, roaming the passages of

Ammarindar. The druids remain vigilant against those  ends,

anticipating a new uprising at a most inopportune moment.

The other foes with a longevity to rival that of the demons

are the orcs that roam portions of the High Forest or sweep

down out of the Nether Mountains on a regular basis, driven

by  some   erce  need  to  destroy.  The  druids  have  successfully

repelled countless hordes of the foul humanoids, or at the very

least prevented them from in icting signi cant damage to the

city or the great trees in which it resides. Such invasions of the

forest are almost commonplace, but the druids can never afford

to relax their vigil lest the creatures eventually catch them by

surprise and  nally succeed in destroying the tree-city. With the

arrival of new citizens, the entire community has begun taking a

more proactive approach to the orc threat once more. Even now,

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

plans are being discussed for the creation of forti ed outposts,

similar to Ascalhorn in days gone by.

The feyri, though a newer threat, are perhaps the most dan-

gerous and sinister of all. In addition to their remarkably subtle

and clever tactics, the feyri have a vested interest in seeing the

downfall of everything representing Eaerlann, for they rightfully

perceive it as a symbol of their own suffering. Even with Sarya

Dlardrageths recent defeat, House Dlardrageth is a formidable

and  cunning  foe,  and  surviving  its  machinations  will  require

every resource the druids and the new community can muster.

The Druids Allies

For the long centuries that the druids of Tall Trees occupied

the ancient elven city, there were always a number of allies they

could count on in times of dire need. Such colleagues shared a

love of the forest and a stout enmity against those who would

plunder  or  wound  it.  The  druids  did  not  often  call  on  such

companions, but they knew that aid was only a plea away when

it was truly needed.

The Harpers have long been allies of the druids and have

come to their aid on more than a few occasions. It was members

of the Harpers who succeeded in destroying Hellgate Keep and

sealing away at last the demonic hordes that had plagued the

vicinity. Even today, as Eaerlann is being reborn, the Harpers

are nearby, ready to lend a hand against enemies.

The  High  Forest  is   lled  with  all  manner  of  woodland

creatures, some great and some small. Perhaps the most majestic

and steadfast of these are the great treants, led by the ancient

Turlang. Turlang has been a trustworthy and dedicated ally of

the druids of Tall Trees for years. Turlang is currently in the

process  of  growing  the  forest  outward  to  encompass  Hellgate

Dell, hoping to ward it in natural growth and seal it away from

the  prying  eyes  of  adventurers  and  sinister  agents  alike  once

and for all. Though he is more than capable of expanding the

forest all on his own, he has called on the druids to assist him,

providing magic and nurturing to the new trees sprouting up as

well as protection from threats too quick and sly for Turlang to

deal with effectively.

Membership in the Druids

In the past, becoming a part of the druids circle at Tall Trees

was almost impossible. The residents of the enclave did not see  t

to allow any strangers to come near their forest home, forcibly

driving off adventurers from the region and leaving no doubt

that they meant business. Because of the druids reclusive nature,

their ranks remained very small.

Recently, conditions have changed in Teuveamanthaar, with

the arrival of elves returning to their ancient home. Because of

the bustling activity taking place in the tree community, more

visitors now come and go. In addition, with the druids various

foes increasing their dangerous activities in the High Forest, the

druids have a greater demand for manpower and talents than

ever before. These two factors have allowed the circle to begin

growing. The druids are still quite cautious and hesitant to deal

with just anyone, but they do allow for the possibility of new

blood more readily than in the previous  ve centuries.

An initial meeting with the organization begins with agents of

the druids working beyond the borders of the tree-city. Prospective

members can  nd themselves approached by a ranger or wood

elf and asked for assistance with some matter pertaining to the

safety and security of the High Forest. The tasks may begin as

small  ones,  such  as  running  a  simple  errand  or  assisting  in  a

skirmish against a marauding orc warband, but if the prospects

prove themselves, more can be asked of them, until eventually the

druids agents permit them to visit Teuveamanthaar. Eventually,

if the prospects exhibit both the acumen and skills needed by the

druids and a trustworthy nature, they can be asked to join the

group permanently.

Characters of many different skill levels and types can prove

useful to the circle (provided they demonstrate a healthy respect

for the environment while practicing their craft). Those with

strength of arms are always in demand to help battle foes, while

spellcasters are useful for unusual work and in supporting roles.

Clerics of certain faiths are welcome, while druids and rangers

are most closely embraced.

Fangshields

The  Fangshields  is  a  widespread  organization  of  good-aligned

monsters and talking beasts dedicated to watching and guarding

the places where civilized races do not dwell, and countering

the actions of evil monsters and organizations. While most of

them act alone, from time to time they assemble in small groups

all over Faern, searching for news of evil monsters and their

plansand striking to kill when they have the advantage.

History

For  years,  the  membership  of  the  Fangshields  was  nothing

more than a few followers of Lurue who tried to keep an eye

out for signs of evildoing. The groups numbers remained low,

since members lacked easy ways of contacting each other when

separated by stretches of civilized land. They preferred to remain

hidden and pass information to other groups with more resources

at their disposal, but recent activities by their evil counterparts

convinced them to step up their own efforts and band together

against these efforts. The recent surge in the number of humans

and elves turning to Lurue and Nobanion for spiritual guidance

have  given  the  traditional  members  of  those  faiths  greater

awareness of the outside world, access to civilized resources,

and helpful allies to pass messages using human-built roads. With

news of evil organizations hiding in pockets of the wildlands,

the good monsters decided to take more decisive action. Drawing

on their humanoid allies, the members of the Fangshields have

established a network of allied creatures willing to  ght evil on

a larger scale.

The Fangshields Today

Most Fangshields members worship Lurue, Nobanion, or Selne,

but some serve other deities. They welcome any nonhumanoid

good creature into their ranks, as well as lycanthropes and other

occasionally humanoid creatures; this more for practicality than

because of prejudice against civilized folk, because some members

have a hard time telling humanoids apart, and they worry that

evil spies could in ltrate their company in the guise of friends.

The  Fangs  have  three  semipermanent  bases  of  opera-

tionone in the Silver Marches, one in the Shining Plains,

and one in Aglarond (though rather than built structures, these

are natural landmarks easily recognized by the group). Smaller

meeting places can be found in just about any terrain. In many

ways the Fangshields act like the Harpersspying on enemies

and  launching  surprise  attacks,  but  rarely  taking  large-scale

action for fear of drawing too much attention or depleting the

groups numbers.

The Fangshields hope to develop a strong network of allied

monsters keeping watch in the wild areas, able to call on each

other for defense and information. All but a handful are crea-

tures  native  to  Faern  (the  few  exceptions  are  some  celestial

counterparts of Faernian creatures), but they sometimes get

advice and guidance from celestial servants of their three

primary faiths.

The  organization  contains  several  smaller

groups, such as the White Pack (a pack of good

Selnite werewolves), the Plainsrunners (a

pack of blink dogs), the Ivory Charge (a

small herd of unicorns), Stormwind Aerie

(an  extended  family  of  giant  eagles),

the  Maned  Brothers  (four  wemic

paladins of the Legion of Lions; see

page 102) and Thunder Ride (a troop

of centaurs). These groups tend to be

the military arms of the organization,

responding  in  unison  to  threats  or

calls for help. Other members include

awakened animals, dryads, lammasu,

a  guardian  naga,  a  storm  giant,  a

young bronze dragon, a nymph, giant

owls,  an  androsphinx,  sprites,  treants,

hybsils, and pegasi.

The organization has just over three

hundred members, though no meeting has

ever  contained  more  than  forty  of  them

due  to  geographic  factors.  Perhaps  another

three hundred friends of the organization know

it exists, but outside those select few, most of the

people of Faern are unaware that the non-evil monsters

of Faern are allied for any purpose.

The Fangshields Foes

The group keeps a sharp eye out for the People of the Black Blood,

the Cult of the Dragon, beholder cults, and the Zhentarim, all of

which employ evil monsters or intrude upon the wildlands as part

of their goals for control of Faern. The Fangshields consider

evil humanoids such as orcs and goblins mortal enemies becazuse

of their many abuses and attacks in the past. Evil dragons are

the groups greatest enemy, for a dragon can devastate a large

area in a short amount of time; normally the Fangshields call

for allies from outside the group when a dragon threatens. The

Fangshields oppose the church of Malar because of its deliberate

focus on the dark and cruel parts of nature, and the Red Wizards

for their horrible experiments such as the black unicorns.

The Fangshields Allies

The Fangshields count the churches of Lurue, Nobanion, and

Selne as strong allies, less so other nature-oriented faiths, and

tend to keep most other groups at arms length. Good barbarians,

druids, and rangers are the most likely to get a friendly response,

sorcerers  and  wizards  less  so  (since  these  arcane  spellcasters

have a long history of hunting monsters for spell components

and  experimentation).  They  avoid  civilization  unless

they  can  travel  in  disguise,  for  they  have  been

hunted by the ignorant as evil beasts on more

than one occasion. As their numbers grow,

they are spending most of their effort on

information, defense, and  nding like-

minded allies.

Membership in

the Fangshields

Politics  within  the  organization

is  rather  strange;  nominally  all

members  are  equal  and  there

are  no  leaders,  but  monsters  of

the  same  subgroup  (such  as  the

centaurs) tend to voice their opin-

ions as a bloc, while the weaker or

single creatures tend to defer to the

stronger  or  more  gregarious  ones.

Only  the  senior  members  can  invite

new  creatures  to  join  the  group,  and

only if at least three of them agree to

the  invitation.  If  a  creature  accepts  the

invitation, he, she, or it swears an allegiance

oath  to  the  Fangshields.  Part  of  this  oath

says that if the new member ever turn to evil, its

life is forfeit at the teeth, paws, and horns of the rest

of the members.

The  Fangshields  dont  like  collecting  dues  in  the

form of money, preferring services and magic items and

tools they cannot easily manufacture themselves, such as healing

potions and items specially made to  t nonhuman shapes. Simple

armor and magical disguises are particular favorites. They use

the small amount of coins they collect for paying expenses for

their humanoid contacts and allies. In theory, the Fangshields

have a large pool of treasure to draw on, but it is scattered over

a hundred individual lairs separated by miles of distance, and no

centralized account of who has what exists (though some of the

more lawful minds in the group would like to make such a list to

facilitate an exchange of items so they end up in the possession

of those who best can use them).

civilized humans out of dangerous areas without attracting

too much attention. These activities take place in the creatures

home territory and as such dont have a set schedule unless the

creature rarely spends time in one place (for example, adventur-

ing monsters), in which case the elders expect the creature to

spend one tenday in four patrolling its home territory or an

unclaimed territory. If the group needs to attack, they muster

all available members in the area, using them according to their

skills (sneaky creatures are sent to scout, fast ones to  ank and

cut off retreat, and so on).

Fellowship of the

Purple Staff

The Fellowship of the Purple Staff is an organization that intends

to turn the wild land north of Turmish into a peaceful theocracy

with a strong in uence on trade in the Inner Sea. It sees the

relative wilds of the Gulthmere Forest and the coastal land east

of Cedarspoke as a place wealthy with resources and suitable for

colonization by an alliance of benign deities. Founded by priests

of good and protective deities, the Fellowship recruits like-minded

individuals to drive out or slay evil creatures in order to make

the land safe for civilized folk.

History

Formed in 1368 DR by far-thinking priests, the Fellowship is

still a very young organization. Originally just a small group of

clerics  of  Chauntea,  Helm,  and  Selne,  they  quickly  attracted

the interest of certain paladins of those faiths, who wished to

defend a new country in the name of their deities. Like-minded

priests of Lathander and Sune soon joined their ranks, and the

Fellowship sent agents to explore the Gulthmere for good places

to build farmsteads, roads, and outposts. For a short time the

group met resistance from followers of Nobanion in the area,

for the Nobanionites feared the careless slaughter of animals and

mistaken aggression against the good beasts of the forest, but

this fear was quickly allayed, and as of 1372 DR the followers of

Lord Firemane allied with the Fellowship. By late 1372 DR they

had established three small forti ed hamlets in the northeastern

part of the forest and cut simple roads for trading with Amry

and Telpir. Dwarf explorers and miners in the area trade with the

farmers, providing raw metals and tools in exchange for food and

other soft goods, and a number of dwarf paladins moved here

to watch over their kin. In the past few months the Fellowship

has recruited two veteran wizards (a diviner and a transmuter) to

help build roads, waterways, and defensive structures in exchange

for permission to build towers and engage in peaceful research

undisturbed.

The Purple Staves Today

Now that it has ties to outlying communities (such as Amry and

Telpir) and a support structure for its farmsteads, the Fellowship

is looking to explore other parts of the forest and  nd suitable

places for towns so it can  nalize its vision of what members call

the Holy Realm. They believe the founding of this country is

the will of their deities, and they hire adventures to deal with

problems such as hunting dangerous monsters in the remote parts

of the forest or rooting out camps of the Pirates of the Fallen

Stars (which threaten Amry and Telpir).

Ideally, the Holy Realm will be a large number of connected

temple-farms separated by swaths of old-growth forest and re-

planted areas for timber harvesting, defended by champions of

the faith and connected by infrastructure built by allied arcanists.

The priests believe that in time they can export raw materials

(mainly ore, timber, and pelts) and  nished goods (armor, tools,

wood  items,  and  clothing),  establishing  the  Holy  Realm  as  a

powerful trading partner with other lands on the Inner Sea.

The Purple Staves

Foes

Many opposing religious groups want to

see the Fellows fail. Bane, Malar, Shar,

and Talos would especially like to see

the Holy Realm fall, though none

of those deities seems to be devoting

signi cant effort to this purpose. The

People of the Black Blood would love to

turn the peaceful villagers into lycanthropes and

drive them into a tribal lifestyle in the forest, and

the church of Silvanus is watching carefully to

see how much damage the Fellows do to nature

in the name of civilization.

The Purple

Staves Allies

Obviously,  the  Purple  Staves  are

very  friendly  with  the  churches  of

Chauntea, Helm, Lathander, Nobanion,

Selne, and Sune. They are careful to main-

tain open diplomatic ties with Turmish, the

cities on the Dragon Coast, Cormyr, and Sembia.

They are building a relationship with the Harpers, as

both groups strive for balance between civilization and

nature. Some of the Fellows are also members of the

Field Guardians (a paladin order of Chauntea; see page

100) or the Vigilant Eyes of the God (a paladin order

of  Helm;  see  page  105),  and  can  call  on  their  fellow

paladins in times of need.

Symbol of the

Fellowship of the

Purple Staff

Membership in the

Purple Staves

The  members  of  the  Fellowship  are  welcoming  to  almost  all

people regardless of race as long as they prove they are hard-

working  and  interested  in  preserving  the  vision  of  the  Holy

Realm. Most members of the Fellowship are human. The many

half-elves in the organization re ect the proportion of that race

among the adventurers of Faern as well as the many half-elves

81

who worship Sune. Most of the elves joined because they want to

participate in building a new elven homeland in Faern. Dwarves

make up only a small part of the Fellowship, but like the elves

they too are interested in a new land friendly to dwarves in at-

titude and opportunity.

The Fellowship uses its dues to pay bounties for dangerous

monsters, hire adventurers to explore the forests and take care of

troublesome problems, and subsidize the start-up costs of expensive

professions in the temple-farms (such as anvils for blacksmiths,

in exchange for agreeing to remain

for at least two years). The senior

members  of  the  Fellowship  are

heavily invested in the success of

their  country-building  venture,

and most of the money they have

at  their  disposal  comes  from

private sources rather than dues.

They  hope  that  as  their  com-

munities grow they can depend

more on money from dues and

taxes and wean the government

off their personal fortunes.

Members  of  the  Fellowship

are  called  Fellows  (regardless

of  gender)  by  those  within  and

outside  the  organization.  It  is  a

common and accepted title among

the people of the Holy Realm, and

Fellows  are  usually  addressed  by  the

title and their  rst or family name, such

as Fellow Randal.

The three temple-farms of the Holy Realm

have a total population of about 900 people. The

common folk of the Holy Realm know the Fel-

lowship exists (most of them were recruited by Fellows)

and look to the group for protection and spiritual guidance.

The Fellows are respected in the Holy Realm, for the

people know the Fellows keep them safe and work to

bring others to the area who can improve and strengthen

their new homeland. Many community leaders are Fel-

lows, though being a Fellow is not a requirement for

holding lay of ce. All Fellows have an equal vote in Fellowship

decisions, and all topics for voting are announced to the Fellows

at least a month in advance, barring an emergency. The senior

Fellows have no more political power than the newer ones, though

all  respect  their  experience  and  opinion.  People  who  join  the

Fellowship are provisional members, called Newfellows, for one

year. During this time they can be dismissed from the Fellowship

by a simple majority vote; however, new members are carefully

screened before the offer to join is made, and the Fellowship has

ousted only a handful of members since its founding.

fellowship.

Additional duty requirements depend on the character class

of the prospective member. A character must spend at least one

continuous tenday a year performing these duties, and in times

of need the Fellowship can call upon him for additional tasks.

Newfellows are expected to work immediately upon acceptance

into the organization, and the Fellows often assign them a second

tenday of service some time later in that  rst year. Fellows are not

paid anything other than room and board while doing this work. A

Fellow can work alone or with others (including nonmembers) at

his discretion, though for sensitive tasks (such as guarding a holy

item) the Fellowship might insist than only members participate.

If a Fellow can serve in more than one capacity, the Fellowship

assigns tasks based on ability and the needs of the community.

ClericUse magic for healing the people and aiding in the

administration of justice (zone of truth during a trial or lesser

geas as part of sentencing, for example), counsel and lead the

people in religious services.

DruidUse  magic  to  heal  or  aid  the  animals  and  crops

(plant growth, for example), facilitate or accelerate public works

(see wizard duties, below), educate the people about respecting

and caring for nature, counsel and lead the people in religious

services.

PaladinGuard a person, place, or thing of importance to

the Fellowship or the community (this service includes serving

as a town guard or military of cer).

RangerPatrol, scout, and guard for the community; educate

the people about respecting and caring for nature.

WizardUse magic to facilitate or accelerate public works

projects (continual  ame to light town streets, levitate to help

building construction, mending to repair items, illusory wall to

give the appearance of stronger defenses, fabricate and wall of

stone for roads, and so on). The Fellowship provides any expensive

material components for these works (such as for continual  ame).

Wizards with this task are expected to work to the best of their

ability; for example, a high-level wizard cannot ful ll her duties

by simply casting one helpful 1st-level spell per day for a tenday;

she must put forth a reasonable effort in accordance with her

skill level (though the Fellowship does not expect her to leave

herself vulnerable by using all her spells for building and none

for defense).

Any spellcaster with an item creation featCreate magic items

as directed by the Fellowship within the time period (normally

potions or other use-activated items). The Fellowship pays the

gp costs for the items, though the caster must account for the

XP cost herself.

Favored in Guild Bene t: If you have the Favored in Guild

feat, you gain a special bene t for belonging to this guild depend-

(2nd) to your spell list. (If you have levels in more than one

divine spellcasting class, choose one class spell list to receive this

bene t; all other classes are unaffected.)

New spells described in Chapter 2.

gaining a new wizard level.

Guardians

of the Weave

The Guardians of the Weave is a loosely allied group of spellcasters

who oppose evil spellcasters, evil gods of magic, and those who

would damage or destroy the Weave. Founded three years ago

by concerned agents of Mystra, the group quickly gained support

from other churches and is now a widespread organization of

heroes who try to undo the damage caused by evil spellcasters.

What binds the Guardians together is a love of magic and the

desire to protect it against all threats, and in this cause people of

many countries and styles of magic set aside their differences to

defend their common joythe Weave. They believe the greatest

threat to magic in Faern is the Shadow Weave, for if Shar gains

enough power from worship through use of the Shadow Weave,

she may eventually challenge Mystra, consume the Weave, and

force  all  who  would  use  magic  to  obey  her  terms,  making  it

nearly impossible for good magic to exist. The Guardians try to

 nd ways to hinder, convert, or destroy this corrupting rival to

their beloved magic.

The Guardians come in many shapes, sizes, and temperaments.

Some are far-traveling, some remain in their home city their

entire lives. All keep alert for news of harm to the Weave and its

good users, whether a phaerimm plot, a new wild magic zone,

witch hunts by nonspellcasters, or rumors of someone

using Shadow Weave magic. They aid each

other  as  best  they  can,  whether  by

providing  a  place  to  rest,  spell

trading, or even an emergency

teleport spell if possible. The

Guardians recognize that

the  practice  of  magic  is

a  bond  between  brothers

and  sisters  of  power,  and

believe  that  protecting

that bond and its source is

more  important  than  life

itself.  Or,  as  their  founder,

Aluvauna  Thornym,  put  it,

What  purpose  to  destroy  an

enemy, if magic itself be the cost?

History

The Guardians of the Weave was founded in 1372 by

Aluvauna Thornym, a black-haired adventuring mage

from Waterdeep. Aluvauna was troubled by an encounter with a

Zhent wizard whose magic was dif cult to identify, resist, and

counter. Her special sense of the Weave, coupled with research

into the wizards spellbook and certain divinations, revealed his

use of the Shadow Weave to her. Disgusted at this affront to

Mystras magic, she gathered several of her allies and told them

of her concerns. They concurred that Faern needed good-minded

spellcasters  to  join  to  protect  the  source  of  pure  magic,  and

the Guardians of the Weave was born. Aluvauna pulled a few

strings with the church of Mystra and got an of cial church

blessing for her endeavor. Within a month, a dozen more inter-

ested Mystran and Azuthan casters joined the group, hailing

from as far away as Halruaa, and within a year representatives

of Deneir, Isis, Savras, Selne, and the elf and gnome magic

deities pledged solidarity with the Guardians. Aluvauna found

herself in charge of a network of activist mages spanning much

of Faern. Quickly adjusting to the position of leadership, she

designated a lieutenant in each city served by a Guardian, trained

her associates to recognize the signs of the Shadow Weave, and

circulated magic to help them observe and report on dangerous

spellcasters. Far more public than the Harpers, the Guardians

are starting to earn a positive reputation among the common

folk of Faern.

The Guardians Today

The Guardians is a young organization, and is suffering some

growing pains. With such rapid growth, a

wide network, and language dif culties,

there was some chaos in the ranks over

who  reports  to  whom  and  the  establish-

ment of common badges and

signalsbut  Aluvaunas

efforts  in  the  past  six

months  have  stabi-

lized the organizations

numbers  and  provided  a

stronger  hierarchy  for  passing

information. Some lieutenants are

concerned that spies have in ltrated

their  group,  and  theyre  trying  to

 nd  a  subtle  way  to  identify  potential

enemies without offending or alarming existing

members. Aluvauna is working to make peaceful

contact with individuals in two key areas: non-evil

necromancers  who  choose  to  worship  Velsharoon

instead of Azuth or Mystra, and progressive Thayan

wizards who seek magic for its own sake rather than

for the power to dominate others. She feels that these

Velsharoonite  and  Thayan  contacts  would  allow  her

people access to information otherwise blocked to them; so far

all but two (one from each group) she has reached were either

openly hostile or Shadow Weave users.

Aluvauna and many other Guardians are practical enough

to accept that ideology isnt enough to convince opposing spell-

casters to turn away from evil and destruction, so they study

common  techniques  used  by  evil  mages  and  practice  magical

strategies that block or counter those styles. When not seeking

out and  ghting evil spellcasters, they catalogue wild magic and

dead magic areas, offering a small reward for tips that lead to

the discovery of a new location not in their records. Their small

library is expanding quickly in this specialized area, and they do

what they can to mark these dangerous areas or repair them.

Other Guardians explore ruins and unearth tombs looking for

dangerous magic items and artifacts so they can be locked away,

destroyed, or otherwise kept out of the hands of those who would

use such things to do harm.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

The  Guardians  of  the  Weave  has  outposts  (usually  a

lieutenants  home)  in  Silverymoon,  Waterdeep,  Baldurs  Gate,

Neverwinter, Arabel, Shadowdale, Selgaunt (Sembia), Darromar

(Tethyr),  Heliogabalus  (Damara),  Velprintalar  (Aglarond),

Mulsantir (Rashemen), Alaghn (Turmish), Cimbar (Chessenta),

Skuld  (Mulhorand),  the  Great  Rift,  and  Halagard  (Halruaa).

When members convene, they usually hold small meetings at a

local lieutenants house, though they have built a shrine outside

Silverymoon  that  they  consider  the  spiritual  center  of  their

organization; some have reported unusual bene cial magic effects

near the shrine. Many members have never met each other, since

only thirty members attended the largest gathering in the past

year, due to various ongoing missions and geographical factors.

The Guardians Foes

All organizations of evil mages are enemies of the Guardians,

but a few are particularly hated. The Cult of the Dragon not

only practices horrible forms of necromancy, it wishes to help

evil dragons rule the world. The Zhentarim have similar plans

of  domination  and  are  backed  by  the  tyrannical  power  of  an

evil god. The Red Wizards are mostly evil, most of them want

to rule the world, and most of those who dont are interested in

using magic to corrupt and pervert other creatures. The shades,

though mysterious in their long-term goals and mostly con ned

to Anauroch, are devotees of Shar and users of the Shadow Weave.

The phaerimms are inherently evil and masters of powerful magic,

and they are unafraid to use their magic to further their evil

goals. While the church of Shar isnt composed just of arcane

spellcasters, all those who worship Shar contribute to the strength

of Shadow Weave magic and therefore also are enemies.

Of course, there are many lone mages, or minor cabals of

foul-minded spellcastersand the Guardians have a much easier

time dealing with them. The Guardians have standing orders to

capture any solitary known practitioner of either evil magic or

the Shadow Weave (and in larger cities Aluvauna has made sure

her agents are legally able to do so). In the case of members of

large  groups  such  as  the  Zhentarim,  the  Guardians  are  more

cautious in their attacks, tracking their enemies until they can

be dealt with in a way that doesnt bring retaliation upon their

own organization.

While this practice makes them unpopular with evil mages

and users of the Shadow Weave, the Guardians have rarely been

attacked despite their public availability. One reason is that any

mage who would attack another without provocation normally

brands himself as dangerous, and most evil mages arent willing

to expose themselves to attack from public authorities without

a very good reason. Another reason is the Guardians are known

well enough to one another that an attack on one would bring

an investigation and retaliation by others in the group. Thus, like

city guards, the Guardians have relative safety in numbers and

the power of order on their side; aside from infrequent attacks

by  the  unbalanced,  they  can  move  safely  despite  their  stated

opposition to evil and chaos.

The Guardians Allies

The groups devotion to good has made it easy for the Guardians

to make alliances with other organizations. The Harpers, the

Lords Alliance, the Moonstars, the newly reformed Covenant

(see page 100), and various knighthoods and paladin orders have

pledges of mutual assistance with the Guardians in times of need.

Rumors in some high circles say the Seven Sisters have given the

group their blessing.

The Guardians have strong ties to the churches of Mystra,

Azuth,  and  Selne,  and  they  maintain  friendly  relations  with

the followers of Deneir, Isis, Savras, and Thoth. Their gnome

members have built ties with the church of Baravar Cloakshadow,

and their elf-blood members communicate with the churches of

Corellon  Larethian,  Hanali  Celanil,  and  Sehanine  Moonbow.

The church of Torm appreciates the Guardians aid in dealing

with wild magic and dead magic areas, and for their particular

efforts against the Zhentarim; Kelemvors church respects them

for their opposition to dark necromancy.

Membership in the Guardians

A potential member has to show a love of magic, active opposition

to evil, and integrity. The Guardians cant afford to have warriors

who  ee in the face of wizardry, rogues who cower at the  rst

sign of a magical trap, or spellcasters who are content to let evil

magic  ourish as long as it doesnt directly affect them. A current

Guardian must recommend a potential member to a lieutenant,

who gathers information on the person and, if seemingly suitable,

arranges a meeting. If the meeting (which requires an on-the-

spot detect evil) goes well, the lieutenant petitions Aluvauna for

approval by the  ve senior members.

Most of the Guardians are active spellcasters, though a small

number  pursue  other   elds  and  only  dabble  in  magic.  Many

worship Mystra or Azuth, and about a third of those are clerics.

Spellcasting forms the backbone of the Guardians, though they

hire trusted nonspellcaster friends to deal with other functions

vital to keeping the group running.

Members are given a badge of of ce (a brooch, pin, or amulet

shaped like a golden web stretched across a circle) but are not

required to wear or display it. Each badge is marked on the back

with a number to allow the members to track each other and (if

necessary) identify a fallen or missing comrade by a found badge.

Guardians can act alone or in groups, and there is no restriction

against Guardians working with those outside the group (such as

a members fellow adventurers). Like Harper pins, some Guardian

badges are magic items.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

The Guardians accept dues in the form of money or small

magic items that can be used by agents. Dues are used to pay

for research, informants, government permits, and damages to

property done in the pursuit of their goals. Since most of the

members are adventurers, the group is fairly wealthy, and the

dues are just a token to maintain the organization without having

to dip into private funds. Members in  nancial trouble can have

their expenses covered by the group when on missions for the

organization, but this is discouraged and normally only done in

true emergency situations.

Guardians of the Weave (Standard Arcane): AL CG, LN, LG,

NG; 10,000 gp resource limit; Membership 130; Mixed (humans

85, half-elves 20, elves 13, gnomes 6, others 6); Dues 25 gp/month

(100 gp to join).

Authority Figures: Aluvauna Thornym (NG female human

wizard  11),  Dustwater  (CG  male  half-elf  bard  9),  Havarra

Sorokevka (cleric 3/sorcerer 4/hathran 1 of Mystra).

Important Characters: Sarade Gedreghost (NG female human

transmuter 12), Dorgafal Shiverock (NG male rock gnome bard

7), Ramas-Teth Ankh (LN male human diviner 9).

Associated Classes: Bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer,

wizard, or other spellcasting class.

Associated Skills: Gather Information, Knowledge (arcana),

Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Spot.

Requirements: A character wanting to join the Guardians of

the Weave must be of non-evil alignment and swear an oath to

protect the Weave from those who would abuse or destroy it.

All members have essentially the same duties: Keep an eye

out for known or obvious evil spellcasters and evidence of the

Shadow Weave (whether caster, item, or ongoing effect), report

on what they  nd, and capture (or kill, if absolutely necessary)

said spellcasters or people responsible for the Shadow Weave

materials. Some members stay close to home and mainly spend

time on reports and research, but most are active travelers and

steer their adventures toward  nding foes of the organization.

Most  have  a  magical  or  mundane  way  to  contact  another

member in an emergency, and because some of the Guardians

are only mid-level spellcasters, sometimes help arrives by way

of a teleport spell.

Favored in Guild Bene t: If you have the Favored in Guild

feat, you gain a special bene t for belonging to this group. As

part of their special training, Guardians using detect magic can

recognize a wild magic or dead magic area on the  rst round of

the spell instead of the second round. They get a +1 competence

bonus  on  caster  level  checks  to  detect,  counterspell,  or  dispel

Shadow  Weave  effects,  and  a  +1  competence  bonus  on  saving

throws against Shadow Weave effects.  Members of this group

are also eligible to take the Overcome Shadow Weave feat (see

page 33).

Knights of the

Flying Hunt

Few events are more legendary or spectacular to witness than

one of the famed  ying hunts of Nimbral. Many have heard the

tales of pegasus-riding warriors, their glass armor gleaming in the

rays of the sun, swooping down from the sky to drive off  erce

beasts or destroy pirate ships. Far fewer have actually observed

such a magni cent thing, and those who have consider themselves

most fortunateor unfortunate, if they were the targets of the

Knights of the Flying Hunt.

Hailing from the mysterious island realm of Nimbral in the

Great Sea southwest of Chult, the Knights serve as that lands

protectors, defending its people from dragons, woodland beasts,

and pirates and slavers from distant shores. They dwell in fanciful

castles in the interior of the island and answer to the mysterious

Nimbral Lords, reclusive rulers who spend their days hidden away

from the eyes of others. Only rarely do the Knights venture forth

from Nimbral itself, but when they do, all who see them never

forget the image.

History

The land of Nimbral has always been shrouded in mystery, and

more fantastic lies than truths have been told and retold about the

wooded realm. Certain scholars have gleaned some factual infor-

mation, but the history of Nimbral still remains sketchy at best.

Moon elves originally colonized the island and later welcomed

humans from Halruaa who departed that wizard-dominated land

due  to  their  veneration  of  Leira.  The  two  races  intermarried

freely until no pure elves remained, and their descendants lived

in harmony on the island for many years.

At some point along the way, Nimbrals inhabitants found a

greater need for protection from the depredations of dangerous

beasts dwelling in the forests of the island, as well as from the

raiding of pirates and slavers on the surrounding seas. Thus were

the Knights of the Flying Hunt born, though it is doubtful they

were dubbed such in those early days. The wizards of the land,

long subjugated to the whims of the clergy of Leira, developed

an impressive array of toolssuch as magni cent glass armor,

magical lances, and trained pegasifor the Knights to use in

their endeavors.

The Knights Today

The Knights of Nimbral have three ranks: Commander, Knight,

and  novice.  Commanders  lead  patrols  and  hunts  by  virtue  of

experience,  but  they  wield  power  very  much  as   rst  among

equals  rather  than  brook-no-disobedience  authority   gures.

Onlookers can immediately identify novices by their nonglow-

ing practice suits of armor, but Commanders wear no special

badges or identi cation.

The Knights patrol the skies and coastal waters of the realm

in groups of three to six pegasus-riders (typically including one

or two novices). Patrols  y in one of three daily shifts: morn-

ing, late afternoon, and nighttime. Most Knights assemble at a

mountaintop outpost every seven days to join in a larger hunt

involving anywhere from ten to forty members, which takes them

on patrol over all areas of the realm. Including novices, the full

muster  of  Knights  numbers  approximately

seventy- ve.

In  the  event  that  a  Knight  sounds  a

general cry on an alarm-horn to announce

a threat to the realm, larger hunts muster on

particular mountaintops. That said, a Knight

rarely sounds a general cry; more often heard

is  a  rally  call,  which  signals  for  individual

Knights to race in as reinforcements to deal

with  a  lone  problem.  On  their  patrols,  the

Knights attack predatory beasts and monsters,

repel invaders and raiders (such as pirates and

slavers), observe the whereabouts and doings

of Nimbrals residents and visitors, and en-

force the laws of Nimbral upon visitors and

citizens alike.

The Knights masters are the mysterious

Nimbral  Lords,  of  which  little  is  known.

They  answer  directly  to  these  Lords,  and  it

has been said that a Lord sometimes rides with

the Knights so that he can cast a variant of

mass teleport that snatches the entire Flying

Hunt from the skies above Nimbral and sends

it  to  mainland  Faern  or  to  isolated  islands

in  the  sundering  seas  between.  Whether  this

is indeed true or not, the magic items used by

the Knights of the Flying Hunt (armor, weapons,

steeds, and horns) are made for and given to them by

these Lords.

Knights are provided with full plate armor made

of glassteel (see page 65). Only the Lords (and certain Halruaan

wizards) know how to make such armor, which is as hard and yet

as durable as the  nest battle steel. All novices begin training

with a practice suit of dull gray armor known as  ying hunt

armor. When a novice becomes a Knight, the Lords bestow what

is known among Nimbrese as storm armor: the glowing glass

armor of legend. (Its hues and patterns have nothing to do with

rank or awakened magic, but they shine and shift entirely as the

wearer desires, gaining brightness as their rage or excitement

increases, and going dim as consciousness or physical vitality

fails.) Faithful service and outstanding performance by a Knight

can earn more augmentations. The suits of senior Knights can

have numerous powers.

Knights  of  Nimbral   ght  with  swords,  daggers,  thrown

clubs,  and  heavy  lances.  The  Lords  sometimes  enspell  some

senior Knights lances so that the Knights can activate them

as wands.

The Knights, the wealthiest and most worldly of Nimbrese

(with the exception of the mysterious Lords), dwell in fanciful

castlesstone  structures  built  in  graceful,  sweeping  curves

that  feature  tall,  slender  towers,  balconies,

and  beautiful  stonework.  A  home  farm

surrounds most Knights castles, and on this

land lives a small cluster of tenant families

who  grow  specialized  crops  for  sale  around

the island. Knights follow an elaborate code

of chivalry (designed centuries ago to prevent

them  from  raiding  each  others  holdings

and families, or ever making war upon each

other directly) and a strict code of loyalty to

the Lords, ever mindful of the power those

mysterious  gures wield.

The Knights Foes

Because  the  Knights  of  the  Flying  Hunt  so

rarely venture beyond the borders of their own

realm, few can truly call them a foe. Still, the

 erce creatures that roam the forested regions

of Nimbral, were they of suf cient intelligence

to understand such, would consider the Knights

to be deadly enemies. The Knights do not ruth-

lessly hunt these beasts, preferring to leave them

alone until one or more become a threat to the

common  folk  of  Nimbral,  but  they  respond

quickly and decisively whenever trouble arises.

Beyond the shores of Nimbral, the only folk who

could truly call the Knights foes are the seafaring

folk who use piracy and slavery as a means of making

a living. Many slavers hailing from Calishite ports

revile the members of the Flying Hunt as ruthless raiders and

bandits,  blaming  them  for  many  strange  disappearances  and

bad  luck,  which  suggests  a  long  history  of  strife  between  the

Nimbrese  and  any  who  would  come  slave-raiding  within  the

Knights reach.

Beyond  those  two  kinds  of  enemies,  the  Knights  have  no

argument with any other folk who come ashore, so long as they

observe the laws of Nimbral. The history of the Knights is dotted

with occasional tales of rivalries between members, usually in

the form of  erce competition between their various demesnes

and the kinds of crops grown, crafts sold, and so forth.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

The Knights Allies

There are no true allies of the Knights of the Flying Hunt. Being

such an isolated realm, Nimbral itself has no formal relations

with any other lands of Faernthough not long ago, skyships

from the wizard-land of Halruaa traveled to Nimbral in response

to a particularly notable foray by the Knights to the Nelanther

Isles to wipe out a cluster of pirate ships. Whatever transpired

between the Nimbrese and the Halruaans is left to speculation,

but once the conversation was concluded, the skyships returned

to their own lands, and it is generally assumed that the two sides

consider relations to be amicable.

Membership in the Knights

Few become Knights of the Flying Hunt who are not Nimbrese,

although such is not unheard of. Of course, before such a thing

can  happen,  the  visitor  must  become  a  resident,  choosing  to

settle on the island and call it home, and demonstrate unques-

tioning loyalty to both the land and its people. Far more often,

a native  Nimbrese usually rises  into  the  ranks  of the  novices

after journeying in secret to the mainland in her youth to taste

what the rest of Faern has to offer. Many of the most restless

Nimbrese youths cant wait to take the tour, as this practice of

wandering and adventuring is knownand unless they meet with

misadventure abroad, or fall deeply in love with someone who is

rooted to the mainland, they return eventually to Nimbral and

prepare to join the Flying Hunt.

Only those with courage, skill at arms, and an af nity for

pegasi can hope to become a Knight of the Flying Hunt. Most

novices are military-minded characters, typically  ghters and

rangers. Paladins are quite rare, and clerics also seldom make

suitable  members,  for  the  folk  of  Nimbral  do  not  tolerate

organized faith within their realm. Wizards, rogues and other

nonmartial characters rarely demonstrate the talents to serve

effectively.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

Requirements: To become a member of the Knights of the

Flying Hunt, a character must  rst qualify for and take a level

in the Knight of the Flying Hunt prestige class, whereby he is

considered a novice. Once he has joined the ranks of the Knights,

he must participate in regular patrols and defend the island realm

of Nimbral in order to be considered active and to earn his salary.

On occasion, Knights can be asked to journey to distant locales

on behalf of the Nimbral Lords in lieu of their regular duties.

This is still considered active military service.

A  Knight  is  expected  to  begin  construction  of  a  demesne

immediately upon becoming a member of the group. While at

novice level this estate may be modestsuch as a manor house

with one or two farmsas a Knight rises in levels, his prestige

ought to rise with it. Thus, at higher levels, only a true forti ed

castle is considered acceptable.

Note: If you have the Stronghold Builders Guidebook, you

can use the sizing system of stronghold spaces found there to

gauge an adequate size for your manor or keep. Assume that the

total size of your demesne should be three times your prestige

class level in stronghold spaces, and that at least half of those

must be allocated to the main keep, with the remainder serving

as outbuildings, farm houses, and so forth. Thus, by 10th level

in the class, a Knight Commanders demesne is expected to be

no less than 30 stronghold spaces in size, 15 of which are a main

keep. Since no character will want to rebuild his castle at every

level, the majority of the allotment will necessarily go toward a

larger forti cation early on, with more outbuildings and farms

added as the need arises.

Favored in Guild Bene t: A Knight of the Flying Hunt must

have the Favored in Guild feat to qualify for membership in the

organization and must have taken 1st level in the prestige class

(see page 106). Thus, he gains special bene ts automatically for

belonging to this group. He earns a salary of 100 gp per Knight

of  the  Flying  Hunt  level  each  month  so  long  as  he  actively

participates in his duties or is on special assignment. He receives

any necessary curative and restorative spells to heal wounds and

other maladies sustained in battle. And he receives the legendary

 ying hunt armor of the Knights (see page 65) as a gift from the

Nimbral Lords.

The Knights of

Imphras II

The Knights of Imphras II is an elite order of paladins and clerics

who pledge fealty to the crown of Impiltur and dedicate their lives

to the defense of the Realm of the Sword and the Wand. The

Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike, as the order is formally

known, is composed of holy warriors of the Triad (Tyr, Torm, and

Ilmater) who specialize in hunting down and destroying  ends

and other buried legacies of ancient Narfell.

Because Impiltur is confronted by many threats from within

and beyond its borders, members of the Knights of Imphras

II  must  deal  with  a  wide  range  of  situations,  from  daggers

hidden amid the robes of court life to the horrors of unexplored

demoncysts that lie beneath the surface of Impilturs uplands,

and  respond  with  an  appropriate  degree  of  tact  and  martial

prowess.

History of House Heltharn

of Impiltur

In the Year of the Dawndance (1095 DR), Imphras Heltharn,

War-Captain of Lyrabar, united the city-states of Lyrabar, Hlam-

mach, Dilpur, and Sarshel, the wood elves of the Grey Forest,

and the shield dwarves of the Earthfast Mountains to face the

menace of the hobgoblin hordes advancing from the Giantspire

Mountains, from where they had only raided sporadically before.

After  a  terrible  struggle,  the  combined  host  of  Imphras  was

driven back to the shores of Bluefang Water. There, with the

aid  of  Soargar,  Mage  Royal  of  Old  Impiltur  and  Archmage

of  Lyrabar;  his  apprentice,  the  young  sorceress  Sambral;  and

the visiting archmage, Velgarbrin of Baldurs Gate, the folk of

Impiltur routed the hobgoblin horde. Soargar then breathed his

last, but only after telling Imphras of the lost Crown of Narfell

and the cache of magic blades contained within his tower. In

the Year of the Gleaming Crown (1097 DR), after two years of

diplomacy between the cities, the people of now-reunited Impiltur

crowned Imphras as king, ending the era known as the Kingless

Years (9261097 DR). King Imphras I raised a small tower at

Filur, from which he ruled, and, in time, he wed Sambral and

had two children.

Queen Sambral died in the Year of the Rose Pearls (1122

DR), and, after grieving for her, Imphras I soon passed as well.

Their son and eldest child Imbrar took the crown. King Imbrars

younger sister Ilmara became a sorceress under Mhilra of Mil-

varune and found the Scrying Stones of Myth Drannor. Princess

Ilmara then founded Ilmwatch, to guard against the return of

the hobgoblins.

In the Year of the Luminar Procession (1127 DR), Ilmara

saw  the  hobgoblins  stirring  in  one  of  the  Scrying  Stones,  so

King Imbrar marched into the mountains, accompanied by his

Royal Guard, who bore the blades that were collectively known

as Soargars Legacy. Imbrar and his men were never seen again,

but neither were the hobgoblinsso Ilmara sorrowfully took up

the Crown of Narfell and reigned as Impilturs queen.

In the Year of the Parchment Heretical (1167 DR), Ilmara

 nally  took  a  husband  half  her  age,  one  Rilaun  of  Sarshel.

Rilaun became sorely wroth when Ilmara named their  rst son,

Imphras II, king upon his birth in the Year of the Earth Shak-

ing (1169 DR), as was the law. Rilaun took up arms to seize the

crown, but he was murdered before he could do so. Queen Ilmara

continued to rule as regent until the Year of the Immoral Imp

(1185 DR), when Imphras II was crowned king after he reached

sixteen years of age, again according to Impilturan law. In time,

King Imphras II wed Lasheela of Dilpur, and they had two sons:

Talryn (born in 1188 DR) and Lashilmbrar (born in 1190 DR).

After years of illness, Lasheela died of a wasting disease in the

Year of Private Tears (1204 DR), and Imphras II married his

longtime mistress Rebaera Osterhown within months of his  rst

wifes death. She bore him three sonsKuskur

(born in 1205 DR), Velimbrar and Elphras

(identical twins born in 1207 DR)before

dying giving birth to a fourth son, Fylraun

(born in 1209).

In the months following his marriage

to Rebaera, Imphras II became a wander-

wit, leaving the day-to-day rule of Impiltur

to his unscrupulous court advisors. In the

Year  of  the  Gamine  (1208  DR),  Crown

Prince Talryn attempted to have his father

declared un t to rule, but his brother, Prince

Lashilmbrar, who had allied himself with

key  members  of  the  royal  court,  secretly

betrayed him. Although forced to  ee into

exile,  Talryn  retained  the  title  of  Crown

Prince, in accordance with Impilturan law.

The next year, Lashilmbrar and his allies

orchestrated Impilturs involvement in the

destruction of Urdogens pirates, nominally

to eliminate the threat to Impilturs merchant

 eet. Once again Talryn escaped his brothers

treacherous  hand  through  chance,  when  his

ship  was  blown  off  course  before  its  expected

rendezvous with Urdogens  eet. Three years later,

Talryn learned of his fathers death from a cap-

tured Impilturan merchant and returned to Impiltur

in expected triumph. In truth, the death of Imphras II

was a ruse secretly engineered by Lashilmbrar and

his allies, and the Pirate Prince was executed by his

fathers royal guard within moments of disembarking

at  Lyrabars  docks  and  proclaiming  himself  king.

Lashilmbrar then had his father strike Talryns name from the

royal records and had himself named crown prince.

King  Imphras  II  died  in  the  Year  of  the  Winged  Worm

(1225 DR), and the Crown of Narfell passed to his eldest living

son,  Crown  Prince  Lashilmbrar.  As  king,  Lashilmbrar  long

resisted fathering rivals to his rule, but he eventually married

Thelmara Rorntarn, who bore him two sons, Imphras III (born

in 1276 DR) and Rilimbrar (1280 DR). Prince Kuskur married

Elthinda  Balindre  of  Tel amm,  daughter  of  that  city-states

merchant  prince  (equivalent  to  a  hierarch  or  grand  prince),

and she bore him one son, Thaum. Prince Velimbrar married

Almarean Dintersan, and she bore him four daughters and then

a son named Soarimbrar. His twin, Prince Elphras, never mar-

ried, and vanished in the Year of the De ant Keep (1244 DR)

after raising a castle near the Great Barrow. Prince Fylraun, the

youngest son of King Imphras II, married Marea Forgecrown,

who gave him two daughters and a son, also named Elphras.

In the Year of the Deep Moon (1294 DR), the adventurer-

prince Thaum plotted to advance his claim on Impilturs crown.

He secretly plotted to have King Lashilmbrar, Queen

Thelmara,  and  Crown  Prince  Imphras  III  assas-

sinated. Although Prince Rilimbrar was also a

target, he was the only one to escape his cousins

trap. Rilimbrars survival foiled Thaums plot to

place his father, Prince Kuskur, on the throne,

but it did have the effect of elevating Rilim-

brar to the title of king and Kuskur to the

title of crown prince (at least temporarily).

As  unaware  of  his  sons  involvement  as

everyone  else  was,  Crown  Prince  Kuskur

agreed to return to Impiltur and serve as

regent until Prince Rilimbrar came of age.

Since Rilimbrar was likely to have sons of

his own, there was little chance that Thaum

would ever inherit the crown.

With  his  father  away  and  his  doddering

maternal  grandfather  on  the  throne  of

Tel amm, it was a simple matter for Prince

Thaum to empty much of Tel amms trea-

sury to hire an army of mercenaries. With

his  army  and  his  only  child,  Imphras,  in

tow, Thaum sailed across the Easting Reach

and sacked the city of Sarshel with complete

surprise.  Thaum  and  his  mercenaries  then

marched on the Tower of Filur and seized the

throne of Impiltur. Regent Kuskur and King

Rilimbrar  ed into hasty exile, but without access

to Impilturs treasury, they were unable to muster

much  of  a   ghting  force  to  reclaim  the  throne.

Instead, Kuskur turned to Queen Ilione of Aglarond

and  requested  her  aid.  Ilione  sent  her  mysterious

apprentice, known only as the Simbul, to dispatch Thaum with

magic, a mission she accomplished in short order.

With  Thaum  dead,  his  army  of  mercenaries  melted  away.

Efforts  by  Thaums  son  Imphras  (later  Imphras  IV)  to  hold

the throne himself came to naught, and King Rilimbrar was

restored to the throne in the Year of the Black Hound (1296

DR). Crown Prince Kuskur never returned to Impiltur, choosing

instead to live out his remaining few years in self-imposed exile

in Velprintalar. His grandson Imphras was placed under house

arrest in the royal tower at Filur, remaining there even after he

became Crown Prince Imphras IV.

who  could  not  legally  inherit  the  crown.  The  eldest  of  the

daughters,  Princess  Sambryl  (born  in  1299  DR),  grew  into

a  skilled  wizard like  her  great-great-great-grandmother  and

near-namesake, the wife of King Imphras I. As King Rilimbrar

grew old in the late 1330s DR, the members of his court grew

nervous. The honorable king seemed unlikely to have a male

heir, and the traitorous Imphras IV, great-great-grandson of

Imphras I, stood next in line for the throne, despite pleas to

have him summarily executed; according to Impilturan law,

unless  no  male  heirs  exist,  a  woman  is  not  allowed  to  rule

except as regent, and then only if she is the reigning queen.

In  order  to  remedy  this  situation,  King  Rilimbrar  had  his

daughter, Princess Sambryl, wed her second cousin, the crown

prince, in the Year of the Highmantle (1336 DR), although

the  marriage  was  never  consummated.  He  then  appointed

the twelve living male heirs of the fourth and sixth sons of

Imphras II as a ruling council, effective upon his death and

revocable only after Sambryl was no longer queen, and invested

the  Lords  of  Imphras  II  with  the  collective  authority  to

oversee the realm in the name of the crown. The aging king

then decreed that the Lords could select replacements from

the citizenry of Impiltur with the approval of the monarch

(a process that has occurred four times since the founding of

the Lords).

In  the  Year  of  the  Wanderer  (1338  DR),  King  Rilimbrar

passed away, but not in the fashion long expected. A mysterious

 re  destroyed  the  royal  tower  at  Filur,  killing  the  king,  the

queen, Prince Verimlaun (the son of Soarimbrar the Elder), and

then-Crown Prince Imphras IV. When it was determined that

the crown prince died after the king, Sambryl became queen of

Impiltur and moved the royal court to Lyrabar. However, since

Imphras IV was never crowned, he is considered to have never

ruled.  As  queen,  Sambryl  could  not  rule,  but  she  could  serve

as regent for the next living male in line for the throne, if he

were not of age. Because the next in line was the infant Prince

Soarimbrar  the  Younger,  the  eldest  child  of  the  late  Prince

Verimlaun, Sambryl became the reluctant regent.

Under the regency of Queen Sambryl, King Soarimbrar the

Younger never formally acceded to the throne, for he was mur-

dered just days short of his coronation at the hands of unknown

assassins in the Year of the Bow (1354 DR). Next in line was his

infant nephew, King Imphras V, who died of a wasting sickness

at the age of four in the Year of the Wyvern (1363 DR).

The third boy-king of Sambryls regency is King Imbrar II,

younger brother of Imphras V, rightful monarch of Impiltur,

and a few months shy of sixteen years of age. Despite the fact

that  Sambryls  regency  is  expected  to  come  to  an  end  before

the end of the Year of Lightning Storms (1374 DR), little is

known about Impilturs boy king, for the Lords of Imphras II

have long kept him hidden away. Despite years of investigation,

the Lords are unsure who is responsible for the deaths of so

many recent kings and whether it is one of their own, hoping

to preserve the oligarchy at the expense of the monarchy. Only

queen Sambryl is apparently above suspicion, given her obvious

disinterest in ruling.

As a result of all this royal turmoil, Impiltur has rarely

acted outside its borders in the last century. The ever-present

threats  posed  by  the  legacies  of  Narfell,  coupled  with  the

nigh-constant  intrigue  surrounding  the  throne,  have  nearly

paralyzed  the  realm.  Only  the  end  of  the  regency  and  the

commencement of a new reign promises to restore Impiltur to

its full potentiala prospect that might well inspire thoughts

of another regicide in some quarters (within and beyond the

borders of the realm).

History of the Knights

In the Year of the Dowager Lady (726 DR), the unburied lega-

cies of ancient Narfell precipitated the collapse of Impilturs

Durlarven dynasty, driving most of the Impilturan populace

into exile and allowing King Agrosh the Scaled to seize the

throne. Determined not to repeat the mistakes of Cormanthors

Weeping War (711714 DR), the churches of Tyr, Torm, and

Ilmater  proclaimed  the  Triad  Crusade,  and  noble  knights

from across Faern marched on Impiltur to answer the three

gods call.

In the aftermath of the Fiend Wars (729732 DR), the newly

crowned paladin-king, Sarshel Elethlim, established the Order of

the Triad by royal decree as a home for those who had survived

the crusade. The Order gained fame at the Battle of Moaning

Gorge (756 DR) in combat with Ndulus horde of demons, and

it  earned  further  prominence  during  the  Harrowing  of  Nord

(788807 DR), as the never-ending hunt for  ends under King

Nord came to be known. The Triadic knights served the Elethlim

Dynasty ably and well for decades, but the plague that felled the

monarchy in the Year of the Spouting Fish (922 DR) proved

their undoing as well.

During the Kingless Years (9261097 DR) and the early years

of the Elethlim Dynasty, the tradition of Triad-pledged knights

continued in the lands of Old Impiltur, but the number of such

holy warriors slowly waned as lurking  ends and other terrors

picked them off one by one.

In  the  Year  of  the  Shrike  (1196  DR),  nearly  a  century

after the monarchy was restored, King Imphras II returned

from a royal hunt convinced he had seen a sign from the gods

after observing a shrike attack and defeat a small demon. Im-

mediately thereafter, Imphras II established a holy order of

knights, the Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike, to serve

the monarchy and rebuild the traditions of the fallen Order

of the Triad.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

In the years since their orders (re)establishment, the Knights

of Imphras II, as members of the order have come to be known,

have served Impilturs monarchs and regents with distinction,

never failing in their duty to the Realm of the Sword and Wand

or the royal house of Heltharn. Time and again, by working in

concert, the heirs of Sarshels crusaders have driven back  end-led

threats both insidious and overt.

The Knights Today

The Knights of Imphras II have always served at the bequest of

Impilturs reigning monarch. After King Rilimbrar established

the Lords of Imphras II in the Year of the Highmantle (1336

DR),  he  reconstituted  the  Most  Holy  Order  of  the  Sacred

Shrike to serve as the elite army of the dozen-strong Council of

Lords. King Rilimbrar selected three of the Lords to served as

the ruling Triumvirate of the order, one each from the three

churches of the Triad.

The Triumvirate leaves the day-to-day affairs of the order to

the Council of Shrikelords, forty powerful paladins and clerics

who collectively direct the groups efforts. Every Knight of the

order is assigned to serve one of the Shrikelords, but the details

of  that  assignment  vary  from  unit  to  unit.  Some  Shrikelords

organize their units into regular army companies, while others

assemble elite strike teams to meet the needs of the day from

among the assembled Knights.

All Knights are considered members of Impilturs warswords

(the standing army), with most holding of cer positions within

the  corps.  The  chains  of  command  within  the  army  and  the

order are distinct, and, while theoretically it is possibly to report

to ones direct superior or have ones superior report to you, in

practice such a situation never occurs.

The Knights Foes

The  most  enduring  legacies  of  ancient  Narfell  to  plague  the

kingdom of Impiltur are the tiny pockets of the Abyss known

as demoncysts buried beneath the land, which house imprisoned

 ends and other unspeakable horrors. The Knights of Imphras

II are Impilturs  rst line of defense in confronting such hor-

rors  and  the   end-tainted  spawn  they  have  birthed.  Because

escaped  ends often recruit tribes of evil humanoids from the

Earthspurs and the Giantspire Mountains and  eets of pirates

from the Sea of Fallen Stars, the Knights often  nd themselves

in battle with orcs, hobgoblins, buccaneers, or worse. Members

of the order must also deal with those who would traf c with

such  ends, including those who venerate the Gods of Fury and

the Cult of Eltab.

Soargars Legacy

The  archmage  Soargar,  last  Mage  Royal  of  Old  Impiltur,

witnessed  the  plague  in  922  DR  that  decimated  the  royal

family and the disappearance at sea of Princess Aliia in the

Year of the Cracked Turtle (924 DR). Two years after that,

Soargar watched the realm fracture into a mass of warring

conspiracies, as each noble family attempted to place one of its

own on the vacant throne. In the hope that the glory of Old

Impiltur could one day be restored, he saw to the safeguarding

of  many  of  Impilturs  treasures  until  the  day  the  kingdom

would once again stand united.

Just  before  Soargar  breathed  his  last  in  the  Year  of  the

Dawndance  (1095  DR),  he  bade  Imphras,  War  Captain  of

Lyrabar, to go his tower and claim the legacy of Old Impiltur.

There,  New  Impilturs   rst  king  discovered  the  wondrous

Crown of Narfell (see page 71) and more than  ve score magic

blades long thought lost. The swords were given to Imphrass

loyal battle companions, who became his Royal Guard in time,

and were subsequently lost with King Imbrar and his warriors

in the Year of the Luminar Procession (1127 DR). (For more

on their fate, see page 137 of Champions of Ruin.)

The  sage  Othiiyr  Velthrann  of  Tsurlagol  has  made  the

study of the swords of Imbrars Royal Guard his lifes work.

Othiiyr has recorded the rumors and tales surrounding the

lost blades of Imbrar, and speci cally noted the histories and

last known whereabouts of at least a dozen blades known to

have been brought out of the Giantspires by diverse means.

With Othiiyrs help, the Knights of Imphras II have made

it an ongoing quest for the entire order to recover the lost

swords of Soargars Legacy. At present, seven of the blades

have been recovered and are wielded by the Lords. Most young

Knights of Imphras II dream of  nding their own sword of

legacy and thereby demonstrate their  tness to join the Lords

of Imphras II.

The seven swords currently held by the Knights of Imphras

II are named Caercailyss (the Elftear), Heilean (o the hills), Ji-

irnysyn (the Thorned), Melyntaan (Wyrmtongue), Orindaarag

(the Ironstar Blade), Velswyryn (the Chimera), and Xinylnik

(the Bone-eye). Othiiyr is familiar with the histories of nearly

a dozen others, including Ashram, Dornavver (also known

as Demonbane; see page 62), Ellendrin (the Weeping Blade),

Felthann  (Liluths  Summertongue),  Galathos,  Iltornar  (the

Goretooth), Malagar (the Burnfang), Palreth, Sarghathuld

(Orcbane),  Tendar  (the  Wailer),  and  Ul ndos  (the  Corsair

Scourge). Efforts are under way to recover them all.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

The Knights Allies

The Knights of Imphras II are strongly allied with Impilturs

monarchy, and with other groups loyal to the crown. The order

receives signi cant backing from the churches of Tyr, Torm, and

Ilmater. The Knights have fought alongside the Just Knights

of the House of Tyrs Hand in Milvarune  and the Disciples

of  St.  Sollars  the  Twice-Martyred  of  the  Monastery  of  the

Yellow Rose .

Membership in the Knights

Joining the Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike requires the

sponsorship of one of the three churches of the Triad and a pledge

of fealty to Impilturs crown. Would-be Knights are admitted on

a trial basis until they prove their wisdom, bravery, and endurance

by confronting three foes of Impiltur. The Test of the Triad can

only be completed when three senior knights of the order agree

to sponsor the new recruit. Traditionally, most recruits ful ll

such a requirement by destroying at least one  end, participat-

ing in a pitched battle against a host of invading humanoids, or

unmasking a threat to Impilturs crown. All applicants who die

in service to the orders goals and cannot be brought back to life

are posthumously admitted to the order, even if those who have

not yet passed the Test of the Triad.

Knights of Imphras II (Expansive Religious): AL LG; 200,000

gp resource limit; Membership 700; Mixed (humans 630, shield

dwarves 35, hal ings 28, others 7).

Authority Figures: War-Captain Engarth (LG male ranger

2/paladin 9 of Torm/Triadic knight 7), War-Captain Limbrar

(LG  male  Damaran  human  paladin  12  monk  5  of  Ilmater),

and War-Captain Rilimbraun (LG male Damaran human cleric

9/paladin 7 of Tyr).

Important Characters: Sarshel of Laviguer (King Imbrar

II, 15-year-old boy king in deep disguise) (LG male Damaran

human paladin 7/Triadic knight 1).

Associated Classes: Paladin, cleric, Triadic knight (see page

122), knight of the chaliceCW.

Associated  Skills:  Knowledge  (religion),  Knowledge  (the

planes), Ride.

Requirements: A member of the Knights of the Imphras II

is expected to participate in activities organized by his superiors

on a regular basis. The Knights are dedicated to the defense of

Impiltur against all threats, including the depredations of coastal

pirates, hobgoblin hordes from the Giantspires, and the legacies

of buried Narfell.

Favored  in  Guild  Bene t:  Members  of  the  Knights  of

Imphras II gain access to a variety of goods and services that

make  their  adventuring  exploits  easier,  particularly  for  those

tasks done in the service of the Knights. Training, spell access,

and shares of the spoils brought in by Knights actions are all

available, so long as the member continues to contribute to the

efforts of the Knights.

Because the Knights are pledged to the defense of the mon-

archy, they can draw on the royal treasury for the purchase of

arms and armor. Any such item the character wishes to purchase

(within the strictures of the gp limit) can be bought for 90%

of its standard value, with the crown paying the difference. In

addition, characters who battle would-be invaders of Impiltur are

permitted to keep any personal items the interlopers carried, while

the crown only claims siege weapons and the invaders supplies.

Knights also have access to free spellcasting within the orga-

nization. Once per month, any member can request a single spell

be cast upon him. This can be a divine spell cast by a member

of up to two levels higher than the requester, or an arcane spell

cast by a member of up to the same level as the requester. Thus,

a 5th-level Knight could request a single divine spell of a 7th-level

caster or a single arcane spell of a 5th-level caster. If any expensive

material components are needed to cast the spell, the requester

must provide those (or the coin to purchase them). Spells with

XP components are not available through this service.

Once per month, as part of the preparation for a mission,

a Knight receives disposable magic equipment (scrolls, potions,

and  wands)  equal  to  10%  of  the  Knights  expected  character

wealth (see page 135 of the Dungeon Masters Guide) from the

leadership. This bene t most often takes the form of curative

magic, specialized spells needed for unusually tricky or dif cult

missions, or extra  repower for raids. Occasionally, a member

can receive permanent magic equipment on loan (usually with

defensive or unusual properties, such as nondetection), but he is

expected to return these items upon completion of the mission.

The Knights

of the North

The  Knights  of  the  North  are  a  small  band  of  soldiers  and

adventurers dedicated to the ruination of the Zhentarim. Based

in the Moonsea region, they have been labeled as raiders, murder-

ers, and worse by their foes, but the Knights are far more than

simple brigands. Each member of the organization burns with a

desire to see justice done, and the group as a whole is galvanized

by a call to action to stop Zhent plots and machinations wherever

they might spring up.

Members of the Knights of the North can expect hard riding,

harder living, and the hardest of beds each night as they range

the coastal plains and foothills of mountains in their quest to

disrupt Zhent trade in the region. As often as not, Knights are

on the run from Zhent forces bent on hunting them down once

and for all, but they will never stop so long as their goals are

un nished, their causes unmet.

History

Established in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR), the Knights

of the North came into existence after Zhentil Keeps betrayal

against the multicity forces stationed at the Citadel of the Raven

in the Moonsea area. During an attack in that year by invad-

ing orcs, when most of the garrison was on the  eld of battle

outside the citadels walls, wizards loyal to the Black Network

struck. They employed poison and magic to destroy the remain-

ing non-Zhentarim troops still stationed inside, then sealed the

gates and lowered the  ag of the Raven, replacing it with

the standard of Zhentil Keep. When the citadel forces were

driven back by the advancing orcs, they found themselves

locked  out,  trapped  between  the

walls  of  their  own  keep  and  the

marauding  humanoids.  It  was  an

almost total slaughter.

A  few  seasoned  members  of  the

doomed troops, mostly adventurers and

leaders with enough campaign experience

to  recognize  the  catastrophe

quickly  enough  to  react,  man-

aged  to  evade  the  trap  set  by  the

Zhentarim.  Led  by  Galauntar  Hawkhelm,

the commander of the forces, these individu-

als  ed from the carnage and took refuge

elsewhere in the mountains. Hawkhelm was

mortally wounded during the escape and succumbed

to his injuries a short time later.

Angered by the betrayal and wishing to extract immediate

vengeance, the handful of adventurers and military

leaders quickly agreed to continue working together,

dedicating themselves to opposing all things related

to Zhentil Keep. Adopting the name Knights of the

North, the group initially numbered some forty strong. From

their hideout in the foothills of the Dragonspine Mountains, the

Knights prepared to deal a retributive blow to the Zhents.

The  Knights  were  full  of  courage  and  resolve  but  had

little in the way of experience or signi cant numbers, so they

were limited initially to opportunistic caravan raids and the

occasional impromptu back-alley assault on known Zhentarim

agents.  Such  tactics,  while  emotionally  satisfying  early  on,

led to the deaths of a few careless members and an increased

level of risk to others as the Black Network began to react to

the Knights presence. More than a few raids went awry when

helpless-looking  Zhent  caravans  traveling  the  lonely  trade

routes through the Moonsea turned out to be deadly traps set

for the Knights. Bounties of considerable value were placed on

more  than  one  Knights  head,  offers  of  gold  to  anyone  who

could hunt the leaders down and return their remains to the

Zhentarim. The Knights, whittled to half their original number

in the  rst year alone, soon learned the wisdom of caution and

watchfulness and began to alter their strategies.

Over  the  next  thirteen  years,  the  Knights  of  the  North

continued to work at cross purposes to the Zhentarim, ranging

all over the north side of the Moonsea region. Taking advantage

of the chaos during the Time of Troubles and the reign of Cyric

in Zhentil Keep for a time afterward, the Knights became quite

adept  at  in icting  maximum  destruction  with  minimum  risk

to themselves. The groups members learned how to keep one

step ahead of Zhent hunters by establishing a multitude of safe

houses inside urban areas and remote hideouts beyond the

reach of most city garrisons. They adopted the practice

of carving or marking in blood personal signs, along with

the  slogans  One  for  the  Raven

or Justice for another, upon their

victims. They earned the respect and

support of many kinder, gentler folk

of the Moonsea region upon whom the

Black  Network  continually  trod  in  its

quest for mercantile domination.

The  destruction  of  Zhen-

til  Keep  in  the  Year  of  the

Banner  (1368  DR),  coupled  with  the

Zhentarims resiliency in the face of such a

catastrophe, made it clear to the Knights of

the  North  that  they  had  to  do  more  than

mere raiding if they wished to  nally take

down the Black Network once and for all. Thus, after

thirteen years of entirely military action, with little growth

in their numbers, the Knights began expanding their in uence

into other areas, all with an eye toward thwarting

Zhent trade.

The Knights began an active recruiting campaign

designed to swell their numbers. They found the most

success where Zhent activity was cruelest and resulted in broken

lives, but they located individuals who displayed a genuine desire

to stand up to the oppressive and greedy Zhentarim practically

anywhere. The recruiters were always careful to screen applicants

 rst,  employing  scrying  magic  and  trial  missions  with  false

objectives in order to ferret out Zhentarim spies hoping to gain

access  to  critical  plans  and  personnel.  Even  after  a  candidate

seemed worthy, the Knights maintained a layered effect within

the organization, preventing the candidate access to the higher

levels of leadership until they were sure the new recruit could

be trusted.

In  addition  to  continued  raiding  on  Zhent  caravans,  the

Knights also began hiring on as guards for other merchant groups,

particularly those out of Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and Sembia. They

began investing the spoils of their raids into other mercantile

interests, actually establishing legitimate competition with Zhentil

Keeps own trade. They befriended other organizations and guilds

that looked upon their work favorably, in particular the laborers

of the frontier who were most vulnerable to Zhentarim ruthless-

ness.  The  miners  of  Glister,  for  example,  secretly  support  the

Knights and provide them with funds and goods to maintain their

operations. Otherwise, the miners realize, the Zhents could easily

monopolize the caravan route across the Thar and effectively

control them through threats of withholding necessary supplies

of food and clothing unless fealty is promised.

To combat the superiority the Zhentarim had in the skies,

particularly the development of skymages, the Knights began

training an elite force of aerial combatants, mounted on dire

hawks. These special members became known as the skysentinels,

and they evened the odds in aerial combat in the Moonsea region.

As devastating as they are valorous, the skysentinels have made

the Knights of the North more formidable than ever.

The Knights Today

Currently, the Knights of the North have nearly  fty members

divided  into  two  main  contingents.  The  inner  council  of  the

Knights consists of the leadership of the organization and their

immediate  subordinates,  people  of  all  races  and  genders  who

remain  in  the  background  and  are  not  generally  accessible  to

the outer shell. The commanders are those left from the escape

at the Citadel of the Raven eighteen years ago, though they are

all older, wiser, and more prone to administration than raiding.

With success has come the necessity to better plan and organize,

and they focus their energy on such matters, leaving the warfare

to the outer corps.

The commanders also have softened their stance somewhat

in recent years. Whereas once anyone associated with Zhentil

Keep was assured a swift death at the hands of the Knights, in

more recent years the group has displayed a degree of compas-

sion. The Knights routinely offer common soldiers, caravan

guards,  and  other  laypeople  who  were  merely  employed  by

the Black Network a chance for redemption, so long as they

forego future dealings with the Zhentarim. Those who agree

are  given  their  freedom  but  no  second  chances.  Those  who

dont (as well as those who actively work to further Zhentarim

goals) are slain.

The outer corps of the Knights is made up of the foot soldiers,

scouts, spies, and caravan guards who work on speci c missions,

ranging into the  eld to take down Zhent machinations or as-

sisting others in challenging the Black Networks dominance in

the region. They come from all walks of life and bring varied

talents to the causebut they are all driven by the common

desire to see the Zhentarim laid low.

The Knights of the North have no true headquarters, for to

become  stationary  is  to  invite  death.  Instead,  they  maintain  a

scattered network of supply caches and secret assembly points,

places where members  eeing from Zhent pursuers can hole up,

or where leaders can quietly gather to plan, share information, or

garner supplies. Some of these secret hideaways are deep in the

wilderness, up blind canyons deep in the mountains, or in hidden

glens in the forest. Others are unobtrusive warehouses and base-

ments in places such as Phlan, Thentia, and Glister.

The Knights Foes

Aside from the obvious (Zhentil Keep and the Zhentarim), the

Knights dont get along with any of the clergy or followers of the

major temples dedicated to Bane, Cyric, Loviatar, and Mask in

the Moonsea region. Though the Knights have enough on their

hands just dealing with the Black Network, they will never dismiss

a ready opportunity to disrupt the evil intrigues of others.

The Knights Allies

The Knights of the North count as friends many of the numerous

guilds and unions throughout the Moonsea region who suffer

from the monopolistic approach of the Zhentarim. At the very

least, these organizations look favorably upon the work of the

Knights, and in many cases, they secretly support their efforts

through donations of coin, supplies, and hiding places. In some

instances, the groups provide information, jobs, and temporary

muscle to members. The caravan companies are most prominent

among these allies.

Membership in the Knights

Anyone wishing to become a part of the Knights of the North

must be recruited; it is quite dif cult to track down a member

and ask to join, because Knights rarely make their af liation

public knowledge. Prospective members must show some level

of enmity toward the Black Network and its agents, most often

through  out-and-out  con ict  with  Zhents.  Once  recruiters  are

aware of an individual with those qualities, they make contact,

offering a chance to join the Knights.

Characters  of  all  kinds  can  be  of  service  to  the  Knights,

though some are better suited to the rugged lifestyle than others.

Anyone handy with a blade or bow can serve on caravan duty or

with the raiders, or simply as muscle for back-alley confronta-

tions. Spellcasters are always needed for strike teams performing

precision work, and for escape and healing afterward. The stealthy

among the members are often called upon to go undercover and

discern valuable information. Every job is dangerous, and each

provides a valuable service to the organization.

A members service to the Knights of the North isnt always

a continuous affair. At times, a Knight might  nd that he has

drawn too much attention to himself and needs to lie low for

a  while.  In  those  cases,  a  trip  to  a  distant  land  for  unrelated

adventuring might be in order. But in general, a Knight of the

North expects to live for the cause on a full-time basis.

Members maintain some  exibility in their lives, because the

needs for their services might suddenly change. Some members

could be called upon at a moments notice to ride forth to attack

a Zhent caravan or a secret envoy. Specially trained members

might be asked to go undercover for months at a time to ferret

out Zhentarim plots and secret activities and report back to the

Knight leadership. Others might simply be asked for specialized

services (such as spellcasting or crafting of items) on an occasional

or emergency basis, or to provide lodging and care for others who

are in hiding or wounded.

Requirements:  A  member  of  the  Knights  of  the  North  is

expected to participate in activities organized by his superiors on

a regular basis. The Knights are dedicated to bringing down any

Zhent machinations, as well as furthering activities that directly

compete with the Black Network, so only those who are truly

resolved to see this course through to the end will be allowed to

become a Knight, anyway.

Favored in Guild Bene t: If you have the Favored in Guild

feat,  you  gain  a  special  bene t  for  belonging  to  this  group.

Members of the Knights of the North gain access to a variety

of goods and services that make their adventuring exploits easier,

particularly for those tasks done in the service of the Knights.

Training, spell access and castings, and shares of the spoils brought

in  by  Knights  actions  are  all  available,  so  long  as  a  member

continues to contribute to the efforts of the Knights.

Because the Knights engage in legitimate trade, aid merchants

who are rivals of the Zhentarim, and claim the goods taken

from Zhent caravans they raid, they have access to an amazing

array of merchandise. Any item a character wishes to purchase

(within the strictures of the gp limit) can be bought for 90% of

the standard value, while an item offered for sale to the Knights

nets only 60% of the book value. In addition, characters who

participate in raids on Zhent caravans are permitted to keep

any  personal  items  the  guards  and  agents  carried,  while  the

Knights  only  claim  the  goods  in  the  wagons  themselves  for

trade elsewhere.

Knights  also  have  access  to  free  spellcasting  within  the

organization. Once per month, any member can request a single

spell be cast upon him. This spell can be of any level a caster

of up to two levels higher than the requesters level could cast.

Thus, a 5th-level Knight could request a single spell of a 7th-

level caster. If any expensive material components are needed to

cast the spell, the requester must provide those (or the coin to

purchase them). Spells with XP components are not available

through this service.

Once per month, as part of the preparation for a mission,

a Knight receives disposable magic (scrolls, potions, and wands)

equal to 10% of the Knights expected character wealth (see page

135 of the Dungeon Masters Guide) from the leadership. This

bene t most often takes the form of curative magic, specialized

spells needed for unusually tricky or dif cult missions, or extra

 repower for raids. Occasionally, a member can receive permanent

magic  equipment  on  loan  (usually  with  defensive  or  unusual

properties, such as nondetection), but he is expected to return

these items upon completion of the mission.

The Soft Claws

The ancient steel dragon Zundaerazylym has more secret schemes

and  hushed  achievements  than  most  dragons  can  imagine.

Zundaerazylym follows a bright dream: She wants dragonkind

to live in harmony with humanoids. This situation, she believes,

would result in happier, better lives for all. To see such ambitions

come to fruition, she has employed a small corps of agents who

operate throughout the North, from the Sword Coast east to the

borders of Anauroch and Cormyr, and from the Silver Marches

south to the northern fringe of the Green elds. These agents,

who secretly know themselves as the Soft Claws, perform covert

operations on Zundaerazylyms behalf, furthering her dream of

seeing dragons and the civilized humanoids living together in

harmony. The work is dangerous, often taking agents into the

frontier, but the rewards are high, for Zundaerazylym makes sure

to take care of her own.

History

Zundaerazylym has historically observed two great dangers to

the North: the harsh climate and the orc hordes. The  rst must

be endured (magical attempts to meddle with the weather, in her

opinion, lead only to disasters), but the Laughing Wyrm has

always believed she could do something about the orc problem.

Orcs are fecund, and periodically they grow too numerous for

their homes in the labyrinthine mountain-heart caverns of the

North.  When  this  happens,  they  boil  forth  and  sweep  down

on all surface settlements and creatures in their path, pushing

onward (usually south, toward warmer, more lush lands) until

they  are  eventually  destroyed,  leaving  great  devastation  in

their wake.

Some forty years ago, Zundaerazylym began to hatch a plan.

She believed she might be able to manipulate the most evil,

hungry, and aggressive dragons into relocating their lairs into

the paths of the emerging orc hordes so that one was forced

to  ght the other. In addition, she began to develop through

alchemy the means for the more sensible dragons to coexist with

the civilized humanoid races. However, she recognized that such

goals were both ambitious and perilous, for there were many

who would love to either steal away the fruits of her labors or

stop her outright. Thus, she created a secret identityAmundra

Nelaerdra, a plump, gossiping, happy laundress and seamstress

who  resided  and  worked  at  the  Moonstone  Mask,  the  most

famous inn, restaurant, and festhall in Neverwinter, the City

of Skilled Hands.

Through  her  alter  ego,  Zundaerazylym  began  recruiting

agents to serve as her experts abroad, traveling where she could

or would not go and carefully planting legends and rumors about

lost dragon hoards and vacant dragon lairs that slowly confer

magical powers to wyrms that dwell in them, then returning

with  news,  goods,  and  missions  accomplished.  Her   rst  ac-

complices came from the ranks of local traders, woodcarvers,

and failed adventurers who either needed a boost up from their

present  existences  or  simply  showed  the  pluck  and  promise

necessary to carry out her schemes. Zundaerazylym named her

 edgling organization the Soft Claws, and though the groups

accomplishments were initially modest, little by little it grew

in numbers and power, broadening its territory as well as its

talents and acumen.

The Soft Claws Today

The  Soft  Claws  currently  number  more  than  sixty  humans,

elves, hal ings, and half-elves. These agents operate as far east

as Suzail and as far south as Baldurs Gate. They are loose-knit in

structure and organization, keeping abreast of the steel dragons

grand schemes and their roles in it by relying more on chance

meetings and distant signals from Zundaerazylym than on formal

gatherings and direct orders. There is little hierarchy in the group,

which suits both the dragon and her agents just  ne.

The  Soft  Claws  have  many  duties.  They  try  to  relocate

active  dragons  by  improving  or  even  creating  lair-caverns  in

desired locales (remote northern mountains perilously close to

orc colonies); daringly planting maps (usually in the packsacks

of recovered treasure) near known dragon lairs; or even posing

as adventurers and using far-hailing spells to talk to one another

about rich dragon lairs theyre heading for, so that a dragon in

its lair accidentally overhears them. They also plant rumors in

the ranks of the Cult of the Dragon to manipulate the activities

of that evil organization into venturing in directions away from

the true purposes of the Soft Claws.

Members are frequently called upon to gather strange ingre-

dients for Zundaerazylyms secretive experiments. She has begun

developing  numerous

substances  that  would

bene t dragons in various

ways. For example, she hopes one such

concoction will serve as a new source

of  food  for  the  more  good-aligned

dragons,  eliminating  their  need  to

feed  upon  civilizations  population

or  its  livestock.  Another  is  a  bath

of such potency that dragons might

heal more quickly while in its embrace,

allowing them to battle more  ercely

with swarming orc populations. Both

of  these  substances  require  unusual

ingredients, which must be gathered under

the  utmost  secrecy  lest  others  glean  their

purpose and steal them for themselves.

The Soft Claws Foes

The  two  most  obvious  enemies  of  the  Soft  Claws  are

the  orcs  of  the  mountains  and  the  dragons  that  are

unwittingly being relocated. Although the orcs are rarely

blessed with leadership bright enough to see beyond the immedi-

ate threat of a dragon in their midst and thus to recognize the

machinations  that  brought  the  beast  there,  the  dragons  most

certainly are, and more than a few agents have lost their lives

in too daring a ploy. The Laughing Wyrm also suspects both

High Heralds and Harpers to be members of the Soft Claws,

but  she  worries  more  about  in ltration  by  the  Cult  of  the

Dragon,  the  Arcane  Brotherhood,  or  mages  bent  on  gaining

power over dragons. This concern has deepened in recent years,

since more than one of her agents have gone missingand their

nevertokens  with  them.  While  she  is  mistrustful  of  both  the

Harpers and some of the Chosensuspecting that one or both

groups might at any time seize the fruits of her labors for other

purposesshe recognizes the other foes as more immediate and

potentially deadly threats. The Cult of the Dragon would  nd

Zundaerazylyms efforts a potential crushing blow to its in uence

over dragons and certainly a threat to its cause, and the Arcane

Brotherhood, should it ever unearth evidence of her deeds, would

want such power for itself.

The Soft Claws Allies

By necessity, Zundaerazylym has not revealed her true nature or

her grand schemes to many folk. There are few she trusts, and

fewer still whom she believes she could count on to maintain her

secrets and the identities of her agents. One such person is the

owner of the Moonstone Mask, the sorceress Ophala Cheldarstorn.

Ophala and Zundaerazylym are fast friends, and the sorceress

knows Amundra Nelaerdras true nature. Ophala aids the steel

dragon  from  time  to

time  with  her  spells,

and  she  keeps  Zundaera-

zylyms  hoard  magically  hidden  in

an undisclosed place. It is not buried

underground,  in  the  Mask,  or  in

Nelaerdras Bright Weaves Laundry.

Zundaerazylym  often  helps  out

Ophala in return. In addition to an

occasional night spent in more attrac-

tive human guisestaking the shape

of a sick or weary staff member at the

Mask, for examplethe Laughing

Laundress of Neverwinter has more

than  once  smuggled  prominent  guests

out  of  the  Mask  in  her  gigantic  baskets  of

laundry, enabling them to avoid embarrassing con-

frontations with rivals, murderous foes, spouses, superiors,

or admirers. She has also, on several memorable nights,

 own  important  agents  and  members  of  the  Lords

Alliance  out  of  Neverwinter  on  her  back  when  they

needed to be elsewhere in a hurry.

The Soft Claws and their patron also maintain a loose alliance

with  the  all-female  adventuring  band  known  as  the  Galadran

Company,  based  out  of  Waterdeep  but  with  agents  ensconced

in numerous other cities of the North, including Neverwinter.

Zundaerazylym considers Galadaeros, a mature adult male copper

dragon  of  unusually  gentle  and  humorous  characterand  a

patron of sorts of the Galadran Companyto be a staunch ally.

As Amundra Nelaerdra, she is on particularly good terms with

the Galadran agent in Neverwinter, a quiet, always calm man

named Alasturan Malatheer. He runs a shop on Hindalos Street

where he sells maps, charts, and  oor plans of castles, mansions,

lands, and seas of Faern. The two organizations have aided one

another from time to time, and even occasionally engaged in

joint ventures for brief periods.

Membership in the Soft Claws

Though in recent years Zundaerazylym has stepped up her recruit-

ing efforts, the steel dragon is still quite cautious and choosy when

selecting prospective new members. She must be absolutely certain

a potential agent is trustworthy and reliable, able to comprehend

the delicate and risky nature of the work before even being told

the whole truth of the matter. In this effort, Zundaerazylym

relies on Ophala to assist her, having the sorceress utilize her

magic to suss out true possibilities and eliminate threats and spies.

Any new recruit is always given a test assignment or two before

being fully admitted into the group. In fact, until such time as

the candidate is deemed completely trustworthy, he or she often

believes the work is being done for the recruiter directly.

Because the work is varied, members of every talent are needed

and welcomed in the Soft Claws. Quests to  nd and subtly relocate

dragons, hunt for alchemical components, and spy on orc activity

require a wide assortment of skills useful in numerous climates

and terrains. Adventurers often work together in typical groups

composed of members with complimentary talents.

The Soft Claws use the Moonstone Mask as their primary

covert  rallying  place  and  regard  the  Laughing  Wyrm  as  a

kindly  mother.  This  is   tting,  when  one  considers  that  she

nurses them back to health, occasionally comes winging to their

rescue, arranges careers for them, and dispenses advice as well as

unof cial salaries. These payments come irregularly but often;

Zundaerazylym is never short of money thanks to her trading

acumen, the efforts of the Claws on her behalf, and the legacy

left to her by the last of the Mritavvalan clan, whom she rescued

from family foes and guarded for the last three decades of his

life. She always has time to sit with her agents and discuss their

own dreams and goals.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

Requirements: In order to become a member of the Soft Claws,

a character must be a non-evil human, elf, half-elf, or hal ing.

In order to earn a salary in any given month, a member must

devote at least half of that month to furthering the ends of the

Soft Claws. Such efforts are usually informally coordinated with

Zundaerazylym beforehand and can include mapping a region,

scouting orc warrens or dragon lairs, planting false evidence to

coerce a dragon to relocate, or gathering alchemical components

for Zundaerazylym.

Favored in Guild Bene t: If you have the Favored in Guild

feat, you gain a special bene t for belonging to this group. You

receive  lodging  at  the  Moonstone  Mask  for  half  the  normal

rate. You also receive free healing suf cient to return you to full

hit points after one evenings lodging. In addition, you receive

a nevertoken (see page 70) as a symbol of your af liation with

the group and as a tool for your work. Nevertokens are magical

recognition badges carried by all Soft Claws, given to them by

Zundaerazylym. She has a cache of identical items, for the entire

cache of Halruaan family trading-tokens was given to her in the

Year of the Watching Cold (1320 DR) by Ensible Mritavvalan,

the dying last member of that family.

Finally, there is a percentage chance equal to your character

level (or that of the highest-level character in a group of Soft

Claws) that Zundaerazylym will come to your rescue during a dire

situation should you somehow manage to contact her. The steel

dragon will only perform this heroic service once during your

stint of duty with the Soft Claws. Subsequent requests are politely

declined, with the dragon citing her own safety and anonymity

as reasons for her refusal.

Minor Organizations

Faern has hundreds if not thousands of organizations, whether

military, social, economic, or religious. Most of these are not

valorous, are of no consequence, or have very little in uence

outside a very small area. The minor valorous organizations

described below are large enough, in uential enough, or at least

travel far enough to make a lasting impression upon the people

they encounter. Most of the organizations described here are

knightly,  some  are  monastic,  and  a  good  number  are  made

up entirely of paladins. This is by no means a comprehensive

list; it just includes a number of those that have a reputation,

interesting  history,  or  signi cant  in uence  beyond  a  single

settlement or structure. Famous orders known only by name

but not for any deeds are not listed here.

Alliance  of  Freesailors:  Founded  in  1167  DR  by  King

Palaghard of Cormyr, these Cormyrean, Sembian, and Impil-

turan privateers patrol the waters of the Inner Sea, defending

their respective nations shipping from piracy and serving as a

supplementary naval force in times of war. Composed primarily

of Cormyrean ships (collectively known as Cormyrean Freesails),

much of this invitation-only order is active in the Dragonmere

south of Cormyr and the Neck, the narrow strait connecting

the Lake of Dragons to Sembian waters. The total strength of

the Alliance is estimated at some one hundred warships and

other seaworthy vessels.

Arvoreens Marchers: This Tethyrian military order is  fteen

years old and has a history of keeping order and  ghting mon-

sters. Consisting mainly of hal ing paladins of Arvoreen (and

a few like-minded gnomes), the Marchers are highly respected

by local humans and hal ings alike. Their chapterhouse, called

Keeperstone, houses almost one hundred members, including

their  leader  and  founder  Estemal  Talltankard  (LG  male

lightfoot hal ing paladin 6/ ghter 3 of Arvoreen), whose ef-

forts helped keep order in parts of Tethyr during its civil war.

Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as clerics,  ghters,

and rogues.

Barbarians, Mir: These horsemen in the Tunlands around

the Marsh of Tun  ght both the forces of Darkhold and the

Purple Dragons of Cormyr for control of the surrounding ter-

ritory. The Mir have a secret base on the northern edge of the

Marsh of Tun, where their women and children are secluded.

The Mir are hunters and scavengers, living off the land and

stealing from Zhent caravans that travel the northern trade

routes. They seldom trust outsiders since the time a group of

Zhentarim spies in ltrated their tribe and killed many of their

women. Those who are accepted into the tribe are expected to

give a blood oath of loyalty to the tralmir (tribal leader) and

defend the lands of the Mir to the death.

Barbarians, Uthgardt: These tribal peoples who live through-

out the Savage Frontier have sometimes been subtly manipulated

by members of the Covenant (see page 100) into defending the

civilized folk of the North. They are described in more detail

on pages 9397 of Silver Marches.

Berronars Valkyries: The members of this order of female

dwarf  paladins  worship  Berronar  Truesilver.  Their  role  is  to

make sure that dwarf soldiers (most of which are male) make

it home from war. Very tactical-minded, they prefer to  nd a

high vantage point in battles, observing the action until they

see a group of allies in particular danger,  at which point they

charge in to help. Most favor training involving mobility in

battle, and some ride celestial boars as their mounts. They can

multiclass freely as clerics of Berronar and dwarven defenders.

Berserkers,  Rashemen:  These  proud  tribal  humans  are

described on page 136 of Unapproachable East.

Broken  Ones:  This  monastic  order  devoted  to  Ilmater  is

described  on  page  25  of  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign

Setting.

Champions Vigilant: This Tethyrian knightly order is more

than two hundred years old and has more than two thousand

members. It is very prestigious and popular, having saved untold

lives from corrupt barons and bandits during their lands civil

war. The order consists of clerics,  ghters, and paladins of Helm.

Its leader is High  Watcher Toram Gyvvalstorm (LG human

male paladin 10 of Helm). It has forti ed bases in Saradush,

Survale Ford, and Velen. Members of this order can multiclass

freely as clerics and divine champions of Helm.

Circle of Leth: This extremely powerful druid circle based

in the Forest of Lethyr govern the affairs of both Lethyr and

the Great Dale. The organization is described in detail on page

83 of Unapproachable East.

Claws of the Sun and the Ankh: This order was founded

after the Time of Troubles on the orders of Horus-Re. It is the

 rst order of Mulhorandi paladins to serve a god other than

Osiris. Ignoring the obsession with politics so common among

the priesthood of Horus-Re, this rapidly growing order energeti-

cally pursues the evil minions of Set. Members sometimes clash

with the servants of Anhur when that god causes trouble with

his warmongering. They are fanatics and pride themselves on

their lack of fear. They can multiclass freely as clerics, divine

champions, divine disciples, or hierophants.

Companions  of  the  Noble  Heart:  One  of  two  Ilmataran

paladin orders, these aggressive heroes are tasked with eliminat-

ing the cruel and those who are known to enjoy the torture and

suffering of others. The church of Loviatar is their greatest

enemy, and they take great joy in tearing her temples down to

the foundation once the evil followers within are dead. They

are friendly with their peaceful counterparts, the Order of the

Golden Cup. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as divine

champions and  ghters.

The  Covenant:  This  centuries-old  but  newly  revitalized

group  is  an  alliance  of  good-aligned  wizards  and  sorcerers

dedicated  to  uniting  the  human-ruled  realms  of  the  North

against the ever-present threat of orcs and their kin, often by

subtly manipulating human barbarian tribes to  ght against

the evil hordes. Hundreds of years ago, the Covenant played a

signi cant part in the history of the Old North, as outlined

on pages 139140 of Lost Empires of Faern.

The  Darksong  Knights:  These   ghters  and  clerics  of  the

drow goddess Eilistraee are active mainly in the Underdark.

Most are female, and every knight is expected to devote his or

her life to furthering Eilistraees ethos among the drow and

destroying yochlol (the demonic handmaidens of Lolth).

Disciples of the Phoenix: This monk order worships Kossuth

in his good aspect. Its members avoid casual contact with others

and follow a rigid tradition of hard study and strict behavioral

taboos (for example, they only eat food and drink that has been

cooked, preferring starvation to uncooked food and thirst to

water that has not been heated by  re). They strongly believe

in the purifying and redeeming power of  re, and have been

known  to  brand  themselves  as  punishment  for  sins  or  even

commit suicide by self-immolation for the greatest of offenses.

They can multiclass freely as clerics of Kossuth.

Dukars: These mysterious spellcasters of many races live

under the Sea of Fallen Stars. Divided into two subgroups (the

Lorekeepers and Peacekeepers), this all but forgotten order

once promoted peace and harmony among the aquatic races

for the prosperity of all, but now struggles to survive attacks

by its enemies. The group has a secret ritual that implants

living coral under the skin of fully trained members, granting

accelerated healing and a focus for their magic. Lorekeepers

gain increased magical specialization, much like Red Wizards;

Peacekeepers learn how to alter their coral implants for attack,

defense, enhanced senses, enhanced movement,  or stranger

objectives.

Dusk  Circle:  This  group  of  three  druids  shelters  beneath

the  boughs  of  the  edge  of  the  Kryptgarden,  near  the  tiny

logging village of Kheldell, which is tucked into the foothills

of the Sword Coast Spires. The druids only link to the outside

world is a trail winding down through the rolling hills to Red

Larch. The folk of Kheldell cut timber only where the druids

direct, and they plant and tend more trees than they cut, slowly

extending the forest. The druids are rarely seen in the village,

but they maintain numerous moss- oored glades in the woods

where visitors might  nd them.

Field  Guardians:  This  special  paladin  order  devoted  to

Chauntea is described on page 26 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting.

Golden Hands of Vergadain: This group of dwarves, predomi-

nantly rogues, defends the interests of dwarves in Faern. Its

members eliminate monsters and brigands along dwarven trade

routes, ransom kidnapped dwarf merchants, and recover goods

from plundered dwarven caravans. Though some might dismiss

their raids on nondwarven warehouses as simple thievery, they

do it to recover goods stolen from dwarves by force or fraud.

Gray  Hands:  This  elite  cadre  of  powerful  Waterdhavians

who defend the city against criminal offenders is described on

page 37 of City of Splendors: Waterdeep.

Hammers  of  Grimjaws:  Members  of  this  elite  order  of

paladins are drawn solely from two of Tyrs orders, the Knights

of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful Sword. An

existing member must nominate a paladin, who then maintains a

prayer vigil in Tyrs temple. A positive vision (Tyrs warhammer)

means the paladin is accepted, no vision means the paladin must

try again, and a negative vision (Tyrs sword) means the paladin

has failed in some way and must go on a quest to atone, with a

successful quest meaning the paladin is forgiven and accepted

into the order. There are less than a dozen of these paladins

in all of Faern, all of them serious, devout, and experienced

warriors of the faith. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely

as clerics,  ghters, and divine champions.

Hammers of Moradin: This special paladin order devoted

to Moradin is brie y discussed on page 26 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Harmonious Order: These personable and swaggering cler-

ics and paladins of Milil encourage bards (whom they tolerate

despite  alignment  differences)  to  accompany  them  to  create

ballads based on their exploits. This order, currently numbering

about one hundred members, is fairly old, and many famous

stories told by bards actually stem from real quests performed

by this order (though warped and exaggerated in the retellings

over the years). Its role is to guard Milils holy sites and do good

works  in  Milils  name.  Paladins  of  this  order  can  multiclass

freely as  ghters.

Harpers: This loose-knit organization of heroes champions

individual freedoms and the good of humankind. Its members

seek to strike a balance between preserving the natural wilder-

ness and aiding the advances of enlightened civilization. They

actively oppose slavery and other evil activities and challenge

sinister  groups  such  as  the  Red  Wizards  of  Thay,  the  Cult

of the Dragon, and the Zhentarim, working to thwart their

diabolical plans. More information can be found on page 274

of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting and in several

supplements.

The High Heralds: The oldest and most important group of

heralds in all of Faern, the High Heralds were once part of the

Harpers. They eventually separated from that group in order to

remain neutral in the political affairs of the lands throughout

Faern, a necessity if they were to maintain the trust of the

lords  of  the  various  realms.  Though  their  most  important

role is the maintaining of records

and  heraldic  symbols,

they have also in

more recent years become active in the efforts to reestablish

bardic colleges throughout Faern. They see this endeavor as

paramount  to  preserving  the  oral  and  written  traditions  of

many cultures and nations.

Hin  Fist:  This  monk  order  was  founded  in  Luiren  by

hal ings given divine inspiration by their pantheon of deities.

Though members are not required to be good (neutral monks

are allowed), all members see themselves as defenders of all hin,

and travel Faern to right wrongs against the hin, and (they

hope) test their skills against other martial artists. Many of

the maneuvers taught by this order are centered on using an

opponents size and strength against him. Monasteries outside

Luiren may accept exceptional dwarves and gnomes as students,

and it is common for experienced Hin Fist monks to teach the

rudiments of their  ghting style to other hal ings in need of

self-defense (in game terms, this means the hal ing can take

the  Improved  Unarmed  Strike  feat,  and  his   ghting  style  is

recognizable as a lesser form of the hin  st teachings). Monks

of this order can multiclass freely as  ghters, paladins (usually

of  Yondalla),  or  rogues.  More  information  can  be  found  in

Chapter 10 of Shining South.

Knights of the Eternal Order: The church of Kelemvor re-

cently created this order to seek out and destroy powerful undead

that tax the powers of the normal branches of the church. Its

stronghold, a small forti ed keep

outside  Iriaebor,  can  house

all thirty- ve members of the

order  plus  support

staff, though at any time approximately half of the members

are away from home, in search of undead to slay. Paladins of

this order can multiclass freely as clerics or doomguides (see

page 186 of Faiths and Pantheons).

Knights  of  Holy  Judgment:  This  order  of  Tyrs  paladins

focuses  on  the  more  lawful  aspects  of  the  gods  philosophy,

and hunts and punishes criminals and monstersparticularly

devilswhich  it  sees  as  abhorrent  perversions  of  a  lawful

society. The order has approximately one hundred members. It

is on very good terms with the Knights of the Merciful Sword,

another Tyrran order. Exceptional members of this order can

be selected to join the Hammers of Grimjaws, an elite order of

holy knights. Paladins of Holy Judgment can multiclass freely

as clerics and divine champions.

Knights of the Merciful Sword: This order of Tyrs paladins,

currently  seventy  strong,  focuses  on  upholding  good  in  the

world (as de ned by Tyr). It regularly quests to  nd and slay all

kinds of evil monsters, particularly demons. Members are on

very good terms with the Knights of Holy Judgment, another

large paladin order serving Tyr. Exceptional Merciful Swords

of this order can be selected to join the Hammers of Grimjaws,

an elite order of holy knights. Paladins of the Merciful Sword

can multiclass freely as  ghters and divine champions.

Knights of the Mystic Fire: This order of paladins and rang-

ers serves Mystra. The paladins accompany other members of

the church on quests to locate lost hoards of ancient magic, and

most of the leaders of temple guardians are drawn from this

order.  The rangers (sometimes called the Order of the Shooting

Star) serve as long-range scouts and spies for the church and

deal  with  magical  threats  against  the  natural  order,  such  as

rampaging monsters and creatures born of mad experimentation.

The order has at least  ve hundred members, though rarely

are more than a dozen gathered into a single place. Paladins of

this order can multiclass freely as wizards and guild wizards of

Waterdeep (see page 26 of Magic of Faern).

Knights of Samular: This order of paladins in the service

of  Tyr  is  tightly  focused  on  the  supremacy  of  law.  More

information  can  be  found  on  page  47  of  City  of  Splendors:

Waterdeep.

Knights of the Shadow Sword: This group of elite worship-

ers of Shaundakul is dedicated to cleansing Myth Drannor of

the evil that dwells there. Its members face long odds and a

hard struggle, but they have persisted in some form or another

since the citys fall centuries ago. Most of them are  ghters

and rangers, though they have a few clerics and were recently

joined by an incantatrix whose specialized abilities have turned

the tide in several battles. They operate out of Shaundakuls

Throne, an old temple to the god in Myth Drannor, and have

to keep their numbers relatively low (less than thirty) to help

maintain a low pro le in between planned attacks.

Knights of the Shadowy Cloak: This paladin order of the

gnome god Baravar Cloakshadow keeps a low pro le in gnome

communities. Its members seek to eliminate goblinoids, kobolds,

and other evil humanoids, for they believe these creatures cannot

be redeemed. They work secretly so as not to attract attention

or bring about retaliation against local gnome settlements. They

rarely spend much time together, preferring to join mixed-race

adventuring parties to use the strength of the big folk against

their common enemies. They can multiclass freely as clerics,

 ghters, illusionists, and rogues.

Knightswood Nine: This circle of druids dedicated to Silvanus

dwells in the Kings Forest of Cormyr near Knightswood on the

Starwater River. The circles ongoing efforts to ensure that no

unlawful felling of trees occurs have made the forest around

Knightswood  rich  in  exotic  plants,  bustling  with  woodland

creatures, and beautiful to the eye. Members of the circle are

rumored to dwell in an underground home reached by climbing

down into a huge hollow tree and to cultivate mushrooms in

a vast series of caverns linked to their abode. The Nine, who

are all old men led by one Draguth Endrouna white-maned,

opinionated man who likes to cultivate an air of mysterycan

be contacted by speaking to Aunglar the miller or his assistant

in Knightswood.

Legion of Lions: This organization of wemic and werelion

paladins of Nobanion was founded by Karrlon (LG male wemic

ranger 4/paladin 4), a former mercenary who now  ghts for

the Lord Firemane. Karrlon created the order shortly after the

Time of Troubles, and though its numbers are small (less than

two dozen), its members are all powerful  ghters, and they have

quickly  become  the  champion  of  good  monsters  throughout

Faernand dire foes to servants of Malar. They often travel as

a group, but lone members are known to join with adventuring

bands of other races to see more of the world, spread the faith,

and  ght evil. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as

clerics and divine champions.

Lords Alliance: This group of emissaries representing the

interests of numerous major cities in the North and the Western

Heartlands was originally formed to oppose the Zhentarim and

other sinister factions seeking to dominate the region through

trade or treachery. Though the group is more diplomatic than

adventurous, it may call on champions to serve its needs from

time to time. More information on this group can be found

on page 275 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Loyal Order of Innocents: This knightly order was formed

in 1369 DR by royal decree of the Queen of Tethyr. Dedicated

solely to Torm, its members number seventy strong and consist

of  ghters and paladins. Their patron saint is Shield of Inno-

cence, an orog paladin of Torm who gave his life to save the

city of Zazesspur. The order is closely allied with Torms church

in Darromar, and it has many noble sponsors (including the

queen), making it a wealthy order despite its size. Paladins of

this order can multiclass freely as  ghters.

Marchwardens: This organization of hal ing scouts, outrid-

ers, and rangers protects Luiren from incursions of ogres and

other  fell  creatures  wandering  out  of  the  Lluirwood.  More

information  can  be  found  in  Chapters  2  and  10  of  Shining

South.

Monks of the Yellow Rose: Also known as the disciples of

Saint  Sollars,  these  strange  monks  of  Ilmater  are  described

on page 25 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting.

Moonstars:  Also  known  as  the  Tel

Teukiira,  this  prominent  organization

in  Waterdeep  has  extensive  trading

interests  in  the  City  of  Splendors  and

the entire North, and its members often

serve as patrons for valorous expeditions.

See pages 7576 of City of Splendors:

Waterdeep for more information.

Order of the Aster: This widespread

and  popular  special  paladin  order

dedicated to Lathander is described

on  page  26  of  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Order of the Crescent Moon: This

order is over one hundred years old, but

is relatively unknown outside Impiltur.

It is remarkable because its members are

mountain-dwelling dwarves who worship

Clangeddin  Silverbeard  and  surface-

dwelling  humans  who  revere  Selne.

This unusual collaboration is the result

of a series of lycanthrope attacks on a

human trading village in Impiltur and

a nearby dwarf settlement. The humans

and  dwarves  decided  to  join  forces  to

eliminate  the  shapeshifter  threat,  and

they  found  that  the  combination  of

Selnite  magic  and  dwarf  battle  prowess  was  very  effective.

The organization is a loose one, mainly passed down through

families (now in its fourth human generation, while a few of

the original dwarf founders survive), and only becomes relevant

when one family is in danger and asks for help from their old

allies. Its symbol is an upright hammer (part of Clangeddins

holy  symbol)  surrounded  by  seven  stars  (part  of  Selnes

symbol), which appears on armor and shields carried by dwarf

and human descendants of the founders.

Order of the Golden Cup: This Ilmataran order is dedicated

to  healing  and  protecting  the  sick,  innocent,  and  weak.  Its

members are the peaceful counterparts to the Companions of

the Noble Heart, soothing the hurts of the world rather than

103

seeking out evil to destroy. They are not opposed to such actions,

but see their role as something different, though they are not

paci sts and never hesitate to  ght evil when confronted with

it. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as clerics, divine

disciples, and hierophants.

Order of the Golden Lion: This order of paladins of Torm

is led by Sir Dylan Lionshand (LG human male paladin 12).

Its speci c task is to actively serve the Penance of Duty (aid

other religions, oppose Bane and Cyric, report and repair areas

of  wild  and  dead  magic).  Members  of

this  order  usually  serve  by  guarding

temples of other faiths that would oth-

erwise be vulnerable or by performing

quests to eliminate Banite and Cyricist

strongholds. The several hundred Golden

Lions  are  easily  recognized  by  their

ornate armor and helm, which they keep

polished to a golden hue. Paladins of this

order can multiclass freely in any one

other class.

Order  of  the  Red  Falcon:  Housed

in  the  Citadel  of  Strategic  Militancy

(northeast of Baldurs Gate), this small

order of Red Knight worshipers has a

history  of  triumphing  in  the  face

of  overwhelming  odds.  It  trains

of cers and others in tactics and mili-

tary  history.  Its  leader,  Lady  Kaitlin

Tindall Bloodhawk (LN human female

aristocrat  1/ ghter  7),  was  possessed

by the Red Knights avatar during the

Time  of  Troubles,  and  while  so  pos-

sessed  she  and  her  large  adventuring

band  traveled  to  Tethyr  to  repel  an

army  of  monsters,  earning  the  fame

and gratitude of Tethyr. The order has

about  fty members. Paladins of this

order  can  multiclass  freely  as  divine

champions and  ghters.

Order of the Risen Scepter: This elite and exclusive order

of paladins and rangers is only open to those who have been

raised from the dead by priests of Osiris (or even spontane-

ously by Osiris himself) after death at the hands of minions

of  Set.  This  grim  group  has  a  remarkably  casual  attitude

toward death, since Osiris has blessed them with the power

to return from the dead unaided if slain by Sets followers

with unjust, dishonorable, or unrighteous means. Because this

ability doesnt apply if someone is slain by other creatures

or in other ways, each member makes the best use of it by

focusing  on  hunting  Sets  followers.  Paladins  of  this  order

can multiclass freely as rangers.

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

Order of the Silver Chalice: This order formed in Waterdeep

during the Time of Troubles when nine young nobles banded

together to defend the Sea Ward against invaders. Aalangama

Gulderhorn (LN human female cleric 9 of Siamorphe) joined

them, and they of cially declared themselves a knightly order.

They relocated to Tethyr to restore just rule in that country.

Though all but three of the founders were killed, the survivors

saw a true heir put on the throne, and now the group defends

Tethyrs eastern border. Only nobles can join this group, and

only on Shieldmeet; because of these strictures the order has

grown slowly, now numbering about forty- ve members. Paladins

of this order can multiclass freely as aristocrats and  ghters.

Order of the Watchful Lion: This military order of Anhurs

followers consists of clerics and  ghters. Though they mainly

serve as the front line in the defense of Mulhorand, they are

encouraged to take leave in times of peace and adventure beyond

Mulhorand, reporting to their superiors on activities beyond

their borders.

Red Raven Mercenary Company: Based in Arabel, the Red

Ravens are by far the largest chartered adventuring band in

Cormyr,  with  membership  exceeding  one  hundred.  Led  by

Rayanna the Rose (LN female human  ghter 16), the group

has for almost a decade been under contract to the crown of

Cormyr  to  scour  the  Stonelands  of  evil  creatures,  and  can

triple its membership for short durations given the right mis-

sion and suf cient funds from an employer. The Red Ravens

are primarily  ghters or multiclassed  ghters with levels in

barbarian, ranger, or rogue. They include a small number of

sorcerers and clerics, but wizards, paladins, bards, monks, and

druids are scarce.

Red Sashes: This mysterious group of Waterdhavian vigi-

lantes and experts at intrigue and hiding is detailed on page 74

of City of Splendors: Waterdeep.

Riders of the West Wind: This group of mercenary clerics

and rangers serves Shaundakul by protecting caravans running

through  uncharted  wilderness  or  distant  lands.  Its  members

have clashed with the Zhentarim many times and are looking

for ways to augment their own forces with  ying creatures to

offset the advantage held by the Zhentarim skymages. Because of

their interests, most of this group are very well traveled, speak

several languages, and are familiar with the customs of foreign

lands to help negotiate peaceful passage for their caravans.

Sacred Shields of Berronars Blessed: This dwarven knight-

hood  was  founded  by  clerics  of  Gorm  Gulthyn  to  look  after

dwarf children and parents (the blessed in the groups title).

This very old order is greatly revered by all dwarves, and it is an

honor to serve as a Sacred Shield. The knights also consider it

their duty to recover any dwarf children kidnapped for slavery

or extortion, and at least two dwarf clans owe their existence to

the Sacred Shields  nding and returning an entire generation

of youths stolen by agents of the Spider Queen.

Shadoweirs: This half-elf military order of Mielikkis clerics,

druids,  and  rangers  is  centered  in  the  High  Forest  and  only

thinly  present  in  the  surrounding  areas.  They  are  religious

zealots intent on protecting their forest from anything that

poses it signi cant harm, and often preach to others or go on

the offensive to accomplish their goals. They are desperate to

halt the encroachment of civilization on forest lands and work

to regrow areas lost to civilizations now fallen.

Shields of the Golden Hills: This order of clerics,  ghters,

and paladins serves the gnome deity Gaerdal Ironhand. It uses

a  system  of  classi cation  based  on   ghting  and  spellcasting

ability (each ranked separately) to determine who is the best

individual for any particular situation. The group is dedicated to

defending gnome communities against any attackers; members

of the order also serve as of cers and champions of larger gnome

military assemblies. Each gnome community tends to have a

chapter of this order, and the chapters operate autonomously

except when several communities are endangered by a common

threat. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as clerics and

 ghters.

Shields of Yondalla: This Luiren-based special paladin order

devoted to the primary hal ing deity is described on page 26

of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose: This powerful paladin

order dedicated to Sune is described on page 26 of the FORGOT-

TEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Skyriders of Aglandar: These knights of Haela Brightaxe are

known for their hippogriff mounts, which they use to perform

rescues and hunt monsters in their home territory, the Great

Rift. The Skyriders rarely leave the Great Rift, though they have

done so in the past to pursue criminals, dangerous creatures,

or even send messages in desperate times.

Sun Soul: This order of good and neutral monks is described

on page 25 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting and dis-

cussed further on page 41 of City of Splendors: Waterdeep.

Swords  of  the  High  One:  These  paladins-turned-wizards

devoted  to  Azuth  are  brie y  discussed  on  page  26  of  the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Swords  of  the  Lady:  Members  of  this  order  of  Selnite

clerics, druids, rangers, and mystic wanderers are thought mad

by many people because of their sometimes eccentric behavior.

However,  when  the  servants  of  Shar  appear,  the  Swords  are

quick to respond and do so in a completely rational and ruthless

manner. They are fanatics and willing to die for their cause

(though,  because  they  are  close  with  the  church  of  Selne,

death is often a temporary condition). Because of their ability

to  quickly  travel  long  distances,  they  almost  certainly  have

access to teleportation magic or a good network of crossroads

and backroads (see page 44 of Magic of Faern).

Telormar Gultor: The dwarf children born of the Thunder

Blessing  are  no  more  likely  to  be  valorous  than  any  other

VALOROUS ORGANIZATIONS

dwarves, but thunder children who do live valorous lives (and

particularly those who are twins) see each other as special kin

sharing a bond like that of an extended clan. These valorous

thunder children, called Telormar Gultor (good-forged souls

in Dwarven), are quick to step up in time of need, especially

when other dwarves are involved and always when another of

their creed needs help. They watch over each other, trade news

on others in the family, and arent afraid to get their hands

dirty  when  the  battle  horns  sound.  A  person  who  harms  or

kills one of the Telormar Gultor has made many enemies with

a single act.

The Triad: This alliance between the churches of Torm, Tyr,

and Ilmater seeks to bring about justice and order in the lives

of good folk everywhere. Organizations dedicated to the Triad

offer protection and succor to anyone who needs it, and strive

to vanquish evil foes. Different groups focus on different aspects

of the trio of gods portfolios, but they all serve a common

cause and work tirelessly to further those aims. The Triad is

perhaps the single most powerful force for good in Faern, for

it is openly spread across every land to one extent or another.

Below are described two Triad-based organizations:

Janessar: Defenders of the oppressed and downtrodden in

Calimshan, the Janessar waylay slaving caravans and free their

illicit cargoes, and stop anyone from being robbed on the road.

They have loose ties with the Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin

(see below) and often ride across the CalimshanTethyr border

to  evade  capture  by  Tethyrian  troops.  They  travel  in  small

groups of  ve or six priests, cavaliers, and paladins, and because

they are never found in groups of more than twelve, their true

numbers are a matter of speculation. They maintain several

secret strongholds in the Marching Mountains and are led by

a trio of elderly priests who no longer ride or  ght (or in some

cases, even see).

Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin: This militant group of

holy warriors, dwelling in a forti ed abbey on the Ithal Road

between Darromar and Saradush in Tethyr, stands apart from

other  organizations  honoring  the  Triad  due  to  its  singular

composition. Made up of clerics, cavaliers, paladins, rangers,

priests, and pious  ghters of all three faiths, the Knights Kuldar

have all vowed to do their best to heal the sick, help the weak,

and  avenge  those  harmed  by  injustice.  Sometimes  called  the

Barakmordanna  among  the  local  populace,  these  champions

number  about  two  thousand  four  hundred,  the  majority  of

whom worship Torm, though all are considered equal brethren.

The group is led by a triumvirate of martial commanders, one

from each faith of the Triad.

Vigilant Eyes of the God: These cautious paladins of Helm

look  for  evil  that  threatens  innocents  and  place  themselves

between the two. Although the order is relatively young, its

numbers are steadily rising as the church encourages certain

members of the Companions of the One True Vision (the Hel-

mite knightly order responsible for many native slaughters in

Maztica, and thus unpopular in Faern even years later) to join

the Vigilant Eyes. Many guilt-ridden Companions see service

in the Vigilant Eyes as a way to atone for the needless deaths

they caused in Maztica, and the Vigilant Eyes is developing a

reputation for sel essness and humility because of the penance

of some of its members. Paladins of this order can multiclass

freely  as  arcane  devotees,  clerics,   ghters,  divine  champions,

and Purple Dragon knights.

Warriors  of  the  Star:  This  Tethyrian  knightly  order  is

composed of the personal bodyguard of the king and queen.

The organization is supported exclusively by royal grants, and

its duties to the royals take precedent over all other activities.

The forty members are all skilled combatants (at least 4th level,

usually in  ghter, ranger, or rogue). Their leader is Monarchs

Champion Vander Stillhawk (NG human male  ghter 8). The

Warriors barracks is in the palace, and they are charged with

carefully screening any visitors for loyalty con icts.

Watchers over the Fallen: These Helmite clerics and paladins

take it upon themselves to protect and heal those wounded in

battle. Though they number only eleven, each is well versed

in  battle eld  healing,  casting  spells  in  the  thick  of  combat,

and surviving multiple enemy strikes while taking care of his

charges. The Watchers usually accompany large forces of soldiers

( fty or more) rather than small ones, though they have been

known  to  look  after  danger-prone  adventuring  groups.  The

Watchers have developed a reputation for saving soldiers who

would have died if left unattended, and soldiers in some armies

have a running joke that they hope Helm  nds them before

Kelemvor does.

Wayward  Wardens:  This  group  is  a  loose  fellowship  of

wandering  Yondallan  hal ings  who  feel  the  need  to  see  the

world  and  arent  tied  to  any  particular  settlement.  They

travel alone or in groups across Faern, coming to the aid of

besieged or threatened hal ing communities. If some of them

in a group are sneakier than others, they tend to split into a

visible group and a secret group to hide their true numbers

and allow for quick reinforcements if a roadside encounter goes

wrong. Paladins of this order can multiclass freely as clerics

and rangers.

Zealots of the Written Word: These monks are followers of

Deneir. They spend their time recording information, develop-

ing their theses on various forms of unarmed combat, earning

money for their church (usually by making books, paper, and

ink, or working as scribes), and even accompanying clerics of

the faith on quests. When traveling, a Zealot normally carries

a  small  book  or  bundle  of  scrolls  showing  the  next  martial

arts form she intends to master, all of which have complex and

 owery  names.  Members  of  this  order  are  sometimes  called

Carmendines  after  their  (long-dead)  founder.  Monks  of  this

order can multiclass freely as clerics.

The four prestige classes presented in this chapter

were  designed  with  valorous  heroes  in  mind.

The noble Knight of the Flying Hunt rides a

pegasus into battle, defending his island homeland against greed,

corruption, and tyranny. The Knight of the Weave draws her

strength from the magic of the Weave and learns, over time, to

harness its power. Much like the Knight of the Flying Hunt, the

Moonsea skysentinel relies on an aerial mountin this case, a dire

hawkto carry him into battle against the evil servants of the

Zhentarim. Finally, the Triadic knight draws upon the strength

of three godsIlmater, Torm, and Tyrto overcome the truly

hateful evils of the world, including demons and devils.

Knight of the

Flying Hunt

Yes, the glass armor and the pegasus are impressive; but its what

I do with them that keeps Nimbral safe from the likes of you.

Baltir Merivolst, Knight Commander

Fireside tales of noble knights astride graceful winged horses,

wearing armor of glass, have enchanted listeners across Faern

for years. All who hear of such breathtaking imagery are fasci-

nated with thoughts of donning their own suit of magic armor,

climbing atop a snowy white pegasus, and taking to the skies in

defense of goodness. The stories are a pale imitation of the true

glory of the Knights of the Flying Hunt. Defenders of Nimbral,

protectors of the island realms quiet, simple folk, noble soldiers

answering to the powerful but mysterious Nimbral Lordsthe

Knights of the Flying Hunt epitomize valor and grace in word,

deed, and bearing.

Becoming a Knight of the

Flying Hunt

Most  characters  become  a  Knight  of  the  Flying  Hunt  after

taking at least seven levels in  ghter or ranger. A few clerics or

paladins manage to master the prerequisites necessary to join the

ranks, but they are rare because of their religious af liations,

something that the folk of Nimbral frown upon. Few other core

classes obtain the military training necessary to qualify.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Race: Human or half-moon elf.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Skills: Handle Animal 8 ranks, Ride 8 ranks.

Feats: Favored in Guild (Knights of the Flying Hunt), Mounted

Combat, Weapon Focus (lance).

Alignment: Lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral.

Special: Native or permanent resident of Nimbral.

Special: Membership in the Knights of the Flying Hunt.

Class Features

As  a  Knight  of  the  Flying  Hunt,  you  become  an  expert  at

mounted combat, utilizing a host of skills and maneuvers to defeat

your  enemies,  while  at  the  same  time  gaining  more  powerful

enhancements to your special glass armor.

Armor Pro ciency: You gain pro ciency in light, medium,

and heavy armor.

Flying Hunt Armor: At 1st level, you are considered a novice,

and you receive a suit of  ying hunt armor (see page 65) from

the Nimbral Lords. This armor is attuned to you and can never

be used by another. If this suit of armor is lost or destroyed, the

Nimbral Lords will replace it, though you must pay the gp cost

normally required to create the armor.

Pegasus Mount: At 1st level, you receive a trained pegasus to

serve you in your defense of Nimbral. The mount remains with

you until it is slain or dismissed. It requires food and rest, and

you are responsible for tending to its needs. When riding this

mount, you gain a competence bonus on Ride checks equal to

your class level.

If the mount dies, you can have it raised from the dead (at

the normal cost) or obtain another mount. You can only obtain

a  replacement  after  living  and  meditating  among  the  trained

pegasi of the Knights for one week.

Armored Ease (Ex): You learn to adapt your movements to

the restrictive nature of armor. Beginning at 2nd level, you can

lessen the armor check penalty of any armor with which you

are pro cient by 2 (minimum 0). At 7th level, this reduction

improves to 4 (minimum 0).

Bonus Feat: At 4th level, and again at 8th level, you gain

a  bonus  feat,  which  must  be  selected  from  the  following  list:

Animal Af nity, Greater Weapon Focus (lance), Greater Weapon

Specialization (lance), Ride-By Attack, Skill Focus (Ride), Spirited

Charge, Trample, Weapon Specialization (lance). You must meet

the normal prerequisites in order to select any of these feats.

Storm Armor: At 5th level, you are considered a full Knight

and your  ying hunt armor is further enhanced by the Nimbral

Lords to become storm armor (see page 69). This armor is attuned

to you and can never be used by another. If this suit of armor is

lost or destroyed, the Nimbral Lords will replace it, though you

must pay the gp cost normally required to create the armor.

Greater Storm Armor: At 10th level, you are recognized by

the Knights as an excellent and experienced leader. For your loyal

service and outstanding performance, the Nimbral Lords bestow

another enhancement upon your storm armor, making it greater

storm armor. You can choose any one of the following effects

and add it to your armor at no charge: arrow de ection (as the

shield special ability); forti cation (light); magic missile (3/day,

CL 7th); mirror image (1/day; CL 10th); spell resistance 13; or

water walk (as a ring of water walking).

Alternatively, you can choose a different armor special ability

(with a price of up to 30,000 gp or a base price modi er of up to

+3 bonus) and add it to your armor at only 75% of the normal

market price.

Either way, this addition requires the normal amount of time

required to improve the item, which likely means that you must

turn over your storm armor to the Nimbral Lords for a number

of days or weeks. If this suit of armor is lost or destroyed, the

Lords will replace it, though you must pay the gp cost normally

required to create the armor.

Playing a Knight of the

Flying Hunt

Youre all about honor and duty to the people of Nimbral, and

you have dedicated your life to defending them from the dangers

of the wider world. You are noble and perhaps a bit arrogant, but

thats all right; youre a member of one of the most elite orga-

nizations in all of Faern. Your fellow knights are like brothers

to you, and youd give your life to save one, but then you could

say the same about a Nimbrese citizen, too.

You serve the Nimbral Lords and respect their commands

because youve seen the wisdom in their actions time and time

again. You support the Nimbral Heralds by enforcing their laws

and edicts, and you respect the opinions of those Knights who

have  been  serving  for  longer  than  you.  They  all  speak  from

experience, and you value that experience and in turn pass it on

to the newer members.

COMBAT

Your armor and your mount are as much a part of you as your

arms and legs. Without them, you feel naked, incomplete. With

them, you feel like you own the skies over Nimbral, and that

nothing can stop you from defending its forests from monstrous

beasts  or  evil  antagonists.  With  the  special  talents  that  come

from being a member of this class, you take the  ght straight

to your enemies, relying on your superior riding ability and skill

at arms to overwhelm your opponents.

If you face a foe that seems more than a match for you

individually, you call in the reinforcements to help you out.

With your companions joining in the  ght, the group will

take full advantage of a combination of  anking attacks and

 yby charges to deal serious pain to enemies. When necessary,

you can dismount to engage in hand-to-hand combat with foes,

but you prefer the advantages you gain from  ghting in the

saddle.

ADVANCEMENT

Many want to become Knights of the Flying Hunt, but few are

permitted the honor. In addition to necessarily being a citizen

of Nimbral, you must exhibit a keen sense of military cunning,

demonstrating skill at arms as well as battle eld tactics. While

not strictly required, you are more likely to be chosen to join if

you have traveled away from Nimbral for a time, seeing the wider

world and learning a bit of its ways. Through this travel, you

not only learn what dangers lurk on distant shores that might

arrive on your own, but you also determine how you measure

up in combat.

You spend your days serving in the Knights, taking your turn

at watch and keeping an eye on the entire island realm along

with your companions. When you  rst start out, you learn to

trust the guidance and wisdom of the older, more experienced

Knights, and your service might be limited to smaller dangers

such as eliminating a wild beast that has wandered too far out

of the forest. After you get some seasoning of your own, you

instinctively  know  how  formidable  your  enemies  can  be  and

are not hesitant to call in reinforcements. You train with your

brothers in arms in the skies above your lands, swooping through

the mountain peaks and high valleys as you master maneuvers

unique to aerial combat. When you are at rest, you enjoy spending

time in your own home, which can start out as merely a humble

house but should grow in time into a great castle with beholden

farms surrounding it.

As you continue to serve with the Knights, your deeds and

brave exploits are likely to catch the eyes of the Nimbral Lords,

who will eventually grant your armor and weapons extra powers.

This is always considered a great honor in addition to a boon to

combat, and Knights who have been in service for many years

sometimes wear armor with powerful and varied enchantments.

You  know  that  if  you  serve  long  and  faithfully,  the  Nimbral

Lords will see  t to grant you similar bene ts.

RESOURCES

In addition to the obvious equipment you receive upon joining

the  groupyour  special  armor  and  your  loyal  steedyoull

de nitely  be  able  to  acquire  other  items  as  a  member  of  the

Knights.  An  exotic  military  saddle  is  not  only  necessary,  but

worthwhile. Beyond your gear, being a member of the Knights

of the Flying Hunt means you have the support and assistance

of all the rest of the members in your endeavors. And, if you

are wounded or suffer other mysterious or magical maladies in

defense of Nimbral and its folk, healing and restorative magic

are available to you at any time without cost.

Knights of the Flying Hunt

in the World

Thank the gods the Knights guard our shores. Otherwise, we would

all be slaves at some Calishite pashas oasis by now.

Felmirgo Lasperk, Nimbrese merchant

The Knights of the Flying Hunt are one of the iconic images

of Faern. Whether you are running a campaign based on or

near  Nimbral  or  not,  the  mystery  and  excitement  of  having

such a prestigious group of individuals appear in the midst of

your characters activities is a unmatched. The Knights can be

an unexpected boon in a dif cult situation anywhere in Faern.

Conversely, if the characters are becoming tainted in matters they

should notparticularly pirating and/or slaveryan appearance

by the Knights with a thoughtful warning may be in order. If

you choose to steer your campaign in the direction of Nimbral

itself, no visit to the island realm would be complete without an

encounter with the famed Knights of the Flying Hunt.

DAILY LIFE

The daily life a Knight of the Flying Hunt is divided between

obligations to the defense of the island and obligations to his

homestead.  Every  knight  is  expected  to  serve  on  a  standard

patrol that covers a limited area near his home every other day.

(A patrol consists of three to six Knights working one of three

time slotsmorning, late afternoon, and night.) In addition, a

knight is expected to join a larger Hunt consisting of up to forty

Knights that sweeps out over the entire island and the coastal

waters surrounding it.

When a Knight of the Flying Hunt is not on duty, he is most

likely managing his estate. A Knight is expected to establish a

dwelling  be tting  his  station,  a  structure  in  keeping  with  his

level of stature among the citizens (and providing them with

acceptable protection from forest predators). At low levels, he

might have an estate thats nothing more than a modest manor

PRESTIGE CLASSES

house, but by the time he reaches senior status, anything less

than  an  impressive  walled  fortress  is  considered  beneath  him.

Once he has constructed such an abode, the Knight is often found

there, tending to the issues that need his regular attention. Such

concerns include providing protection to the tenants who farm

the land around his abode, maintaining the physical structures

of both his own castle and that of the community based around

it, settling disputes between locals, and collecting a portion of

their crops for his storerooms. When a Knight is away (either

on  patrol  or  for  a  more  extended  time  on  personal  matters),

he employs a host of assistants and servants to take care of the

majority of such matters.

Beyond serving as a defense force for the realm at large and

as  a  protector  of  his  personal  demesne,  a  Knight  serves  as  a

peacekeeper and an enforcer of the laws on behalf of the Nimbral

Lords as well as the Nimbral Heraldsthe mouthpieces of the

Nimbral Lords, who deliver warnings and guidance pertaining

to Nimbrese laws, issue judgments, and determine the truth of

disputes.

NOTABLES

Perhaps  one  of  the  boldest  and  most  well  known  (relatively

speaking)  Knights  of  the  Flying  Hunt  is  Baltir  Merivolst,  a

Commander  Knight  who  led  the  expedition  to  the  Nelanther

Isles to deal with a horde of pirate ships in the Year of the Shield

(1367 DR). Little beyond his name is even rumored to be known

beyond Nimbrals own shores, but within the Summer Land, he

is revered as a fearless yet sensible soldier, a true leader of men.

His battle prowess is legendary even among the other Knights,

and his armor is said to bear more enchantments than that of

any other Knight in service. Despite his formidable nature, Baltir

often takes newly accepted novices under his proverbial wing to

teach them both skills and patience and to coax the very best out

of them. He understands that the future security of the Knights

as an organization is dependent upon maintaining the high level

of quality of training he himself has known during his rise.

ORGANIZATION

The Knights of the Flying Hunt operate in a very informal way,

recognizing leadership qualities through action and experience

rather than de nitive rank. The Knights maintain three ranks:

Commander, Knight, and novice. Commanders lead patrols and

hunts by virtue of experience, but they wield power very much as

 rst among equals rather than brook-no-disobedience author-

ity  gures. Onlookers can immediately identify novices by their

nonglowing  practice  suits  of  armor,  but  Commanders  wear

neither special badge nor identi cation. It is the Nimbral Lords

who decide matters of promotion, and they do so by virtue of

the enchantments placed upon the Knights armor.

As  in  almost  any  organization,  rivalries  exist  among  the

Knights. Certain individuals might simply not get along with

others, or one might not enjoy another Knights personality or

opinionsbut seldom does this sort of contention grow into true

animosity or con ict. Once in a while, two neighboring Knights

might compete over lands or markets for their farms crops, but

such con icts are usually resolved peacefully. More often than

not, patrols are arranged so that the antagonists rarely meet. Only

occasionally do individual Knights carry their rivalry further

than a few choice comments.

NPC REACTIONS

Witnessing a Flying Hunt is such a rare and wondrous event

that  few  people  know  how  to  react  when  they  are  privileged

enough to see one. Most  nd the experience awe-inspiring and

a bit unnerving. Those who have heard the tales of the Knights

of Nimbral and recognize the truth in the sight either cheer

mightily (if of decent character) or run for cover (if they have

reason to believe the Knights are there to visit destruction upon

them). Few react with indifference.

The Knights have no true foes, though many Calimshan-based

slavers might beg to differ. Because of the unyielding attitudes

and staunch defense of the Nimbran coastline against predatory

ships,  pirates  and  slavers  hold  a  special  animosity  toward  the

Knights and, indeed, all of Nimbral. Regardless of this hatred,

wise ship captains steer clear of the Summer Land, because they

know how formidable the Knights can be when roused.

KNIGHTS OF THE FLYING HUNT LORE

On  mainland  Faern,  characters  with  Gather  Information  or

Knowledge (nobility and royalty) can research the Knights of

the Flying Hunt to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including

the information from lower DCs (some of which is presented as

false rumors initially and disproved later).

DC 10: The Knights of the Flying Hunt are pegasus-riding,

glass-armor wearing offspring of fell women and hags who dwell

on a misty isle far beyond the jungles of Chult.

DC 15: The Knights of the Flying Hunt are noble lords who

defend their island realm of Nimbral from all comers; they answer

in turn to the strange and mysterious Nimbral Lords, powerful

but insane wizards constantly under the sway of illusions.

DC 20: The Knights of the Flying Hunt are actually a peaceful

group that protects the folk of Nimbral from pirates and slavers.

Folk are welcome to visit Nimbral so long as they are willing

to obey the laws of the land. The Nimbrese are descendants of

Halruaans who left that country many years ago on skyships.

DC  30:  The  Knights  of  the  Flying  Hunt,  led  by  a   erce

and  proud  Commander  named  Baltir  Merivolst,  attacked  and

destroyed numerous slaving and pirate ships in the Nelanther

isles several years ago in retaliation for incursions into Nimbrals

waters.

On  Nimbral  itself,  characters  with  Gather  Information  or

Knowledge (local) can research the Knights of the Flying Hunt

to learn more about them. When a character makes a skill check,

read  or  paraphrase  the  following,  including  the  information

from lower DCs.

DC  10:  The  Knights  of  the  Flying  Hunt  are  all  wealthy

landowners who serve the Nimbral Lords in exchange for their

magical armor and weapons.

DC  15:  The  Knights  operate  in  regular

patrols and work with the Nimbral

Heralds  to  keep  the  peace  and

enforce the laws.

DC  20:  The  Knights  and

Heralds can communicate men-

who guide them to trouble spots

DC 30: The armor the Knights

wear is crafted speci cally for each

member; no one else can wear it.

Knights of the

Flying Hunt

in the

Game

You  can  introduce  a

Knight of the Flying Hunt

into a campaign in a couple

of ways. Any Knight

or group of Knights

could appear somewhere

on  the  mainland  of

Faernparticularly

if  the  PCs  are  in  the  extreme

southern  regions  of  the  Wild  Coast  and  Hal-

ruaaperhaps on a long-range mission similar to

the one in 1367 DR against the pirates of the Nelanther Isles.

The characters might  nd an opportunity to interact with the

Knights, aiding or opposing them in whatever business they are

undertaking. If the relationship between the characters and the

Knights is favorable in the end, perhaps they receive an invitation

to visit Nimbral itself.

Alternatively, a character in the campaign could hail from

Nimbral, perhaps a young and wide-eyed youth hoping someday

to return to the Summer Lands to take a position with the

Knights, but only after traveling abroad and gaining experi-

ence of the wider world. Such a character might have a parent

or  older  sibling  who  is  a  Knight.  The  character  in  question

might also be on the run from the Knights, who have come to

mainland Faern to track him down. Lastly, a campaign set in

or near Nimbral will almost certainly see the Knights of the

Flying Hunt put into play.

If a character in your campaign actually becomes a Knight

of Nimbral, then you have numerous ways to keep the adventur-

ing fresh for that PC and his companions. The Nimbral Lords

might have need of one of their best to undertake unusual mis-

sions to other parts of the world in search of information, lost

artifacts, escaped and  eeing en-

emies, and so forth. Or perhaps

all the characters are Knights

and  are  working  their  way

up the ranks, earning the re-

spect  of  their  brethren  and

perhaps the animosity of po-

litical   rivals  while  they  help

deal with the various trials of

defending the island.

ADAPTATION

Though

the

Knights of the Flying

Hunt  are  a  remarkably  iconic

group, it is not dif cult to ad-

just them for different purposes within your

own campaign. Any organization that makes use

of knights mounted on aerial steeds is a good target

for such an adaptation. Perhaps the pegasi become hip-

pogriffs or giant eagles. The special armor is replaced

by  more  traditional  accoutrements,  but

the  special  abilities  and  perks  of  the

class  levels  could  certainly  remain

the same.

Encounters

An encounter with a group of Knights will most

likely be a patrol sighting on or near the coast of

Nimbral. If the characters are noble and good,

then the encounter might be as simple as the Knights observing

them for potential problems. If the characters are baser creatures,

then the Knights might be confronting them about their unfavor-

able activities. Alternatively, the Knights could arrive at the same

moment a fearsome creature is threatening the group.

VASHAN NANTHER (EL 9)

The  characters,  just  arrived  in  Nimbral,  encounter  a  lone

Knight (actually a novice) who spots a monster at the same

time the characters see it. He swoops in to aid in dispatching

the beast before asking the characters their names and their

business in the area.

KNIGHTS OF THE FLYING HUNT (EL 14)

The  characters  have  come  across  a  small  encampment  of

merchants gathered around a  re one evening when a group

of  Knights  of  the  Flying  Hunt  swarm  in  on  the  offensive.

The  PCs  dont  realize  that  the  merchants  are  actually

evil  lycanthropes,  and  the  six  Knights  are  novices  (use  the

statistics block above) on a training exercise, sent to hunt the

werecreatures down.

NEW ITEM: HURLCLUB

Hurlclubs  are  greatclubs  modi ed  and  specially  weighted  for

throwing. They are identical to greatclubs in every way (includ-

ing pro ciency and all feats or other abilities related to using a

greatclub) except that they cost 10 gp and have a range increment

of 5 feet. Throwing a hurlclub requires two hands.

Despite tavern tales to the contrary, a hurlclub doesnt return

to  its  thrower;  however,  some  Knights  attach  long  chains  to

their hurlclubs to prevent losing them (add 1 gp to cost). Once

thrown, an attached hurlclub applies a 1 penalty to its users

AC  and  on  Strength-  and  Dexterity-based  ability  checks  and

skill checks until it is pulled back in. Reeling in and picking up

a thrown hurlclub is a full-round action that provokes attacks

of opportunity.

Knight of the Weave

The Weave is the lifeblood of Faern, and I would sacri ce my

own life if it meant she would persevere.

Elos Crownsilver, Guardian of the Weave

Over a dozen deities have worshipers who are paladins, promot-

ing law and good across Faern, but it is the Weave itself that

empowers and strengthens the Knights of the Weave. Distinct

from the worship of Mystra, members of this mystic order of

sacred defenders cherish the Weave like a  ne wine, knowing

that its existence enriches all of Faern. They drink deeply of

its power, use that energy to extend its reach, and utterly smash

those  who  would  hurt  the  object  of  their  love.  Their  power

comes from pure magic, and unlike typical paladins, their power

is arcane rather than divine. Over time they become imbued

with the power of the Weave, capable of unleashing magic in

its raw form.

Becoming a

Knight of the Weave

Most  Knights  of  the  Weave  come  from  the  ranks  of  the

Guardians of the Weave (see page 82), the church of Mystra,

or the church of Azuth. A few characters become knights on

their own, usually after witnessing some event that reveals the

beauty,  power,  and  fragility  of  magic  in  the  world.  Fighters

and paladins are the most likely to become knights, and some

bards and sorcerers who are willing to sacri ce some of their

spell power are also aspirants to the knighthood. Knights must

have a basic understanding of magic whether or not they are

spellcasters, and some knowledge of the history of the world and

how magic shaped it is necessary as well. Strength (for melee

attacks)  and  Charisma  (for  spellcasting)  are  key  abilities  for

Knights of the Weave.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Base Attack Bonus: +5 or ability to spontaneously cast 3rd-level

arcane spells.

sorcerer (you use your Charisma score to determine bonus spells

per day, save DCs, and so on). Refer to Table 43 to determine

your spells known and spells per day. You incur the normal arcane

spell failure chance for wearing armor (but see Armored Caster,

below). Your caster level for your knight spells is equal to your

112

knight class level plus any other arcane caster levels you may

have.

This  classs  spellcasting  progression  allows  you  to  quickly

approach the highest-level spells available to a single-class spell-

caster of your character level, but you will always know fewer

spells and be able to cast fewer spells per day than a single-class

spellcaster.

Armored Caster (Ex): Normally, armor of any type interferes

with an arcane spellcasters gestures, which can cause his spells

to fail (if those spells have somatic components). At 2nd level,

you become more attuned to the Weave and can cast your arcane

spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal

arcane spell failure chance. If you wear medium or heavy armor

or carry a shield, you incur an arcane spell failure chance if the

spell has a somatic component.

At 8th level and higher, you can cast your arcane spells in

light or medium armor without incurring arcane spell failure.

Casting in heavy armor or with a shield still incurs the normal

arcane spell failure chance.

Fast Metamagic (Ex): At 4th level you become able to channel

extra magic into an arcane spell to employ metamagic feats more

ef ciently. When spontaneously casting an arcane spell (such as

a sorcerer spell or a knight spell) with one or more metamagic

effects applied to it, you can expend an extra spell slot to cast the

spell without increasing its casting time (as normal for applying

metamagic to a spontaneously cast spell). The extra spell slot must

equal or exceed the spell slot used to cast the metamagic-affected

spell, but need not be from the same spellcasting class.

For  example,  if  you  wanted  to  apply  your  Silent  Spell

metamagic  feat  to  a  magic  missile  spell,  you  would  normally

cast the spell as a full-round action. If you expended an extra

spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you could cast the silent magic

missile as a standard action instead. You could even quicken the

magic missile spell, but you would have to expend a 5th-level or

higher spell slot.

This ability doesnt let you apply a metamagic effect if you

dont already have the appropriate feat.

Spell re (Su): While you are not a natural user of spell re,

your connection to the Weave gives you a limited ability to chan-

nel raw magical energy as if you were born with this talent. You

cannot absorb spells targeted at you, nor can you store spell re

energy for later use, but you can use your own arcane spell energy

to heal (or later, to blast).

Starting at 6th level, you can convert your available arcane

spells (from any class) to healing spell re. You can convert a

single arcane spell slot or prepared arcane spell as a standard

action to heal a target by touch, restoring 2 hit points per spell

level expended for this purpose.

At 10th level, you can also convert your arcane spells into

spell re blasts that deal damage. As a standard action, you can

convert a single arcane spell slot or prepared arcane spell into

Playing a Knight of the Weave

Nothing is more important to you than magics continued exis-

tence. You love the feel of magic  owing through you, whether in

casting a spell, using a magic item, or channeling the raw power

of magic. You see dead magic areas as the Weaves missing limbs

and wild magic areas as dangerous cancers within the Weaves

body. Nothing gives you more joy than seeing the light die in

the eyes of an evil spellcaster. You wake up in the middle of the

night in a cold sweat at the thought of something like Karsuss

Folly ever happening again. The Weave is your friend, your lover,

your armor, and your bright shining sword. The Shadow Weave

is a deliberate violation of something you cherish, and youd love

nothing better than to burn its taint from all of Faern with a

storm of searing blue-white spell re.

There are few Knights of the Weave, no more than two score,

and while they do not have an organized code of conduct, they

recognize each others as kindred spirits working for a common

purpose. Regardless of alignment, religion, or country of origin,

the knights understand the love and respect that each of them

has for magic, and they go out of their way to avoid con ict

within their ranks. Many are associated with the Guardians of

the Weave, and perhaps in time they will organize themselves

as the military arm of that group, much as various churches

have orders of knights focused on protecting their interests with

necessary  violence.  Even  those  knights  not  involved  with  the

Guardians respect them, and the Guardians see the knights as

their champions.

COMBAT

Although you study powerful magic, most of what you know

relates to enhancing your  ghting abilities and, as with a paladin,

your place is in the thick of battle. Because at  rst you have dif-

 culty casting spells in armor, you should use spells to boost your

abilities beforehand or in the aftermath of battle. At 2nd level

you can wear light armor, and a magic chain shirt or mithral

chainmail lets you mix spell and sword freely. By 6th level, you

add spell re to the mix, giving you a way to heal yourself safely

in combat. At 8th level, you can wear medium armor, and most

knights locate or buy mithral full plate armor to give them the

best melee protection that at the same time allows them full

use of all their abilities. At 10th level, your ability to unleash

destructive spell re using your own spell energy means that you

can unleash devastating bolts of pure magic at any time.

You work well with others in combat by taking the paladins

role of front-line warrior supported by magic. In an emergency

you  even  have  offensive  and  countering  spells  of  your  own.

Though youre never as good at blasting enemies as a sorcerer

or a wizard is, your abilities give you a chance to interfere with

enemy spellcasting long enough to allow your allies to end the

 ght. Because at lower levels youre more likely to use lighter

armor, you can  t in easily with sneaky characters, and your

spells can augment your and their abilities in those areas.

At  high  level  youre  best  off  using  your  spells  to  increase

your ability to deal melee damage, reserving a few spell slots for

unexpected opportunities. Your spell re reaches its highest utility

at 10th level, but avoid the temptation to use up all your spell

slots for this purposeyou never know when you might need a

key true seeing or teleport spell.

ADVANCEMENT

Any knight can teach a quali ed person how to begin attuning

himself to the right parts of the Weave. Some potential knights

discover the necessary information by accident or research, but

most who would become knights meet an existing knight at some

point in their travels. A quali ed person is one who shows an

interest in magic, has at least a rudimentary knowledge of the

Weave and its history, and is dedicated enough to swear an oath

to protect it with his life. Many aspiring knights swear this oath

in front of another knight, but that is not necessarythe Weave

itself bears witness to the oath.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Training is an informal matter and does not require active

tutelage by another knight. The new knight instinctively (or by

studying subtle shifts in the pattern of the Weave) understands

what sort of meditation, practice, or study is required to progress

as a knight. Sometimes this preparation entails fasting for several

days near a dead magic area or trying to cast spells on the fringe

of a wild magic area. Another knight might train by studying

lore on pools of radiance in a Mystran library or meditating

on the shore of a sea to recognize how the ebb and  ow of the

tides  mirrors  the  shifting  strands  of  the  Weave.  In  between

experiencing these revelations, the knight continues to practice

his spellcasting and  ghting and keeps an ear to the ground for

news of things needing his attention.

Each knight feels a pull from a slightly different part of the

Weave, guiding what spells he develops in his mind and the role

he adopts among the knights. Some avenging or crusading knights

choose aggressive magic, believing the best defense is a good of-

fense. Others see themselves as protectors and learn metamagic,

counterspelling, and ways of repairing damage to fragile parts of

the Weave. Yet others try to become personi cations of magic,

using  their  knowledge  to  augment  their  own  abilities  or  even

create items that boost them further. Though a wizard might

suggest  learning  a  little  bit  of  everything  to  be  ready  for  all

situations, that approach rarely  ts the typical knights mental-

ity; most knights focus their magic in a speci c area, relying on

their physical prowess and versatile spell re to make up for any

speci c lack of spell knowledge.

RESOURCES

Since the order is rare and its members few in number, knights

are usually more than willing to help each other in times of need,

whether by lending a magic item, casting a helpful spell, or even

joining a quest for a short time. The last occurrence is particularly

common if two knights have very different and complementary

skill sets. One thing knights are always generous with is knowledge;

they keep no secrets from each other when it comes to protecting

the Weave. The knights have friendly relations with the Guardians

of the Weave as well as the churches of Mystra and Azuth (and

to a lesser extent Savras) and can sometimes get aid (particularly

healing magic) from those groups.

Since a knights armor choices are initially limited because of

the risk of spellcasting failure, some knights use bracers of armor

in their early journeys, but once you gain the ability to cast safely

in armor you will likely switch to conventional armor (includ-

ing mithral armor) for better protection, and to fool enemies

into thinking you are without spells. Knights tend to face many

spellcasters and magical monsters, so armor that provides energy

resistance or spell resistance is commonly seen among powerful

knights.  Like  paladins,  knights  usually  carry  magic  weapons;

their favorite choices are those with the speed, spellbladeMag, and

spell storing special abilities (as well as dispellingMag weapons for

knights who dont have the ability to cast dispel magic).

Some knights see their role as the light against shadow and

the shield against darkness. For them to carry out this role, they

must be able to recognize the enemy. The Detect Shadow Weave

User feat, (see page 28) enables a Knight of the Weave (or any

other charcter) to gain this ability. Some knights discover this

feat through independent study, and others learn it from a mentor

knight or an ally from an organization such as the Guardians

of the Weave.

Knights of the Weave

in the World

I once saw a Knight of the Weave teleport alone into a Cult of the

Dragon stronghold. When we arrived an hour later, the cultists

were nothing but spell re-burned ash, and the knight was already

halfway across Faern investigating rumors of a Shadow Mage.

Ive never seen one of our paladins do anything like that.

Toromil the Bright ame, arcane devotee of Mystra

Knights of the Weave have a long reach but lack the overt power

to destroy their enemies outright. This means they must take

a more strategic role or use small-scale forays to accomplish

their goals. This makes them perfect for adventuring parties,

either as PCs, cohorts, or potential employers. They cant topple

the  Zhentarim  or  the  Red  Wizards  on  their  own,  but  they

know a lot and (at higher levels) are very mobile through the

use of teleportation magic, making them a great resource for

explaining the back story of an adventure, pointing the PCs

in the right direction, or showing up just when the PCs need

them  most.  Their  focus  on  combat  and  arcane  spells  make

them similar to a paladin but without the religious trappings,

and their ability to cast spells in armor is an intriguing choice

for a player wanting to play a battle mage (and is willing to

sacri ce versatility and higher-level spells for the fun of getting

their hands dirty).

DAILY LIFE

On a day-to-day basis a knight is searching for threats to the

Weave, lost magic he can discover, lore to learn, and receptive

minds to teach about respecting the Weave. Many knights are

loners and are often mistaken for paladins (which can be confusing

when one insists he cant cure diseases but can break curses) and

engage in paladinlike activities when they sense the Weave wants

them to do so. Knights can be leaders, but most of them lead by

example rather than by giving orders. They respect considerate

spellcasters, and knights in leadership positions tend to quickly

earn the loyalty of any spellcasters in the area for their attentive-

ness and honest desire to hear a quali ed opinion.

ORGANIZATION

The knights have no of cial leader, but the most experienced

knight alive today is Janos the Lichbreaker, mentor to at least

three other knights. He is greatly respected for his knowledge,

power,  and  ability  to  teach  others  about  their  path.  Janos  is

very concerned about the Shadow Weave, and in particular the

activities of the residents of Shade. He spends most of his time

in the lands near Anauroch, digging for news of their activities

and hoping against hope that none of the shades are planning to

revive ancient Netherese spellcasting secrets that might damage

or disrupt the Weave in some way. He doesnt force

his agenda on others but welcomes help when it

is offered, and usually at least one knight assists

him at any particular time.

The knights do not have any of cial ranks,

though they observe each others progress and

comment when one of them demonstrates

a new ability. Fast metamagic, spell re,

heavier armor, and teleporting are

benchmarks of the knighthood,

and the knights are develop-

ing  an  informal  series  of

nicknames  (often  subtly

humorous) that can even-

tually  become  a  series

of  recognized  titles  if

the  knighthood  grows

large  enough  to  merit

such distinctions. For

example,  a  knight

seen  rapidly  cast-

ing  spells  silently

might  earn  the

nickname  Spell-

whisper,  and  someday

Spellwhisper could become be a title in the organization, es-

pecially  if  the  original  Spellwhisper  makes  a  good  name  for

himself among the others.

An  unusual  friendly  rivalry  exists  between  the  paladins

of magic (serving Azuth and Mystra) and the knights. Some

of the paladins are slightly offended that the knights focus

on the Weave rather than the goddess and make a point of

demonstrating their advantages compared to the knights (such

as being able to smite evil). The knights respond by pointing

out that they acknowledge Mystras ties to the Weavethey

are  the  one  and  the  same,  after  allbut  they  focus  on  the

part they can touch; they then show off their own power with

a dazzling display of powerful magic and spell re, a feat no

paladin can match.

The  knights  dont  have  any  serious  rivalries  within  their

organization, since they recognize that different opinions (like

spells of different schools of magic) are natural, and while they

may oppose each other at times, these differences are not worth

 ghting  about.  For  example,  the  knights  think  the  rivalries

between the various Thayan wizard factions are absurd and a waste

of time, but are glad those rivalries keep the Red Wizards from

spending all their efforts outside Thay. This is not to say that

the knights dont argue, but theyre usually happy to let

a matter drop and go their separate ways, expecting

not to see their verbal sparring partner for a

year or more.

NPC REACTIONS

Most  people  outside  of  the

knighthood,  churches  of

Mystra  and  Azuth,  and

the  Guardians  of  the

Weave have a hard time

distinguishing  the  knights

from paladins of Mystra and

Azuth. Thus, theyre treated

with  friendliness  and  re-

spect  for  their  power

and  devotion,  and

people  know  that

the  paladins  are

willing  to  help  in

any way they can.

Evil  individuals

and groups have the

same  problem  as

other  folksmost

cant tell the knights

from  regular  paladins.

This offers the knights a measure of protection, because theyre

in the shadow of a larger group, but also makes them a target

for those who have a vendetta against paladins as a whole. The

Cult of the Dragon and the church of Shar are the only groups

that have a good understanding of what makes a knight differ-

ent; the Cult is too busy with its own mad plans to worry about

a subset of Mystras holy soldiers, and the Sharrans are usually

more concerned about torturing and killing Mystras and Selnes

priests to concern themselves with the paladins. These attitudes

will probably change as the knighthood grows and develops a more

distinct identity. The knights dislike the Cult and the Sharrans as

well as the Zhentarim and most of the Red Wizards, but as they

know they cant deal with the entire organization at once they

save their anger for individuals rather than making systematic

attempts on the group as a whole.

KNIGHTS OF THE WEAVE LORE

Characters with Knowledge (arcana) can research the Knights of

the Weave to learn more about them. When a character makes

a  skill  check,  read  or  paraphrase  the  following,  including  the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Knights of the Weave are a knightly order of

Mystra.

DC 15: The knights are skilled warriors who study magic.

They are not paladins, though they often act like them.

DC  20:  The  knights  use  arcane  magic  rather  than  divine

magic, and some even learn how to create spell re. They know

less magic than a true mage but can hold their own against an

opponent of similar power. The knights revere the Weave itself

rather than the goddess Mystra.

Characters can use Knowledge (religion) or bardic knowledge to

discover the above information, but the DCs are 5 higher.

Knights of the Weave

in the Game

Because the knights are such a small order, it is entirely possible

that in your game they are relatively new and are just now making

a  name  for  themselves  in  the  world.  They  are  also  somewhat

reclusive,  so  it  may  be  that  the  order  has  been  around  for  a

while but has been working in secret, or people have mistaken

its members for paladins of magic deities.

This class is perfect for  ghter-type characters who want to use

some of the more powerful spells without the serious drawbacks

of multiclassing as a sorcerer or wizard. Its also good for players

who want something a little different from a standard class, or

who want their characters to have abilities similar to those of a

paladin but without the lawful good alignment requirement.

ADAPTATION

The Knights of the Weave can easily be adapted to serve as follow-

ers of Azuth or as a true military order supported by the Mystran

church. If youre willing to alter the alignment requirements and

spell list, you could create different splinter knighthoods for each

magic deity, making each group slightly more specialized and

unique.  Azuths  knights  would  learn  more  direct-attack  spells

and metaspell effects, Savrass would study more divination, and

Velsharoons would gain access to necromancy.

Encounters

Encounters with Knights of the Weave are focused on magic,

whether  involving  tracking  down  a  dangerous  spellcaster,

transporting a powerful item, or dealing with a problem area

of the Weave.

ARAVILAR MOONDOWN (EL 7)

Aravilar Moondown is a new member of the Knights of the

Weave, but full of con dence almost to the point of arrogance.

Devoted  to  magic  and  convinced  of  his  elven  superiority,

he often makes the mistake of talking to others (especially

unknown humans) as if they were his underlings. He is travel-

ing with four 1st-level moon elf warriors (use the elf warrior

statistics from the Monster Manual) on a mission to  nd a

traveling potion-peddler who has been selling items tainted

with the Shadow Weave. He might demand to search the PCs

for potions bearing the peddlers identifying mark, or (if one

of  the  PCs  is  known  to  make  potions)  try  to  interrogate  a

character to see if she is the person hes looking for. If one

or more PCs are elves, he tries to get them to help him  nd

the  peddler.  (If  this  occurs,  the  peddler  is  a  mage  of  some

skill,  enough  to  pose  a  challenge  for  Aravilars  group  and

the PCs together.) The elves carry six Shadow Weave potions

of  various  effects,  con scated  as  evidence  of  the  peddlers

tainted magic.

Moonsea Skysentinel

Nothing makes me feel better than soaring over the landscape,

keeping an eye out for Zhent dangers. Except maybe for knocking

a Zhentarim skymage out of his saddle, of course.

Joatra Stelmar, Moonsea skysentinel

Moonsea skysentinels are the eyes in the sky for the Knights

of the North, scouting the landscape, looking for evidence of

Zhentarim  activity.  They  employ  trained  dire  hawks  as  swift

aerial mounts and a variety of combat tactics that allow them

to swoop in, strike enemies quickly, and race away again before

reinforcements can arrive. Whether spying on a caravan  ying

the banner of the Black Network, delivering battle orders to a

Knight raiding party, or hunting and dueling one of the hated

Zhentarim skymages, a Moonsea skysentinel is the light cavalry

of the Knights forces.

Becoming a

Characters  who  want  to  become  Moonsea  skysentinels  most

often follow the path of the martial classes or druid because of

the combination of skills and feats necessary to gain admittance.

Occasionally a rogue or cleric can become a Moonsea skysentinel,

though such characters need additional levels to gain the necessary

ranks in the required skills.

protections make you particularly handy at quick strikes against

ground-based foes with little risk to yourself.

Dire Hawk Steed: As a Moonsea skysentinel, you gain a trained

dire hawk of Large size as your personal mount. The dire hawk

serves you loyally, carrying you into combat or  ghting at your

side. The dire hawk has maximum hit points but is otherwise

a normal specimen of its size. See page 122 for this creatures

statistics block.

Your dire hawk steed gains 1 HD for every three class levels

you gain beyond 1st (increasing to 10 HD at 4th, to 11 HD at

7th, and to 12 HD at 10th). Each time it gains a Hit Die, its

natural armor bonus and Strength score each improve by 2 (in

addition to the normal improvements gained with added Hit Dice,

such as skill points, feats, and ability score improvements).

A dire hawk steed cant be used as an animal companion.

Magical Defense (Ex): Your training in resisting the deadly

spells  cast  by  Zhentarim  skymages  manifests  as  a  bonus  on

saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities for both you

and your mount. This bonus is +1 starting at 1st level, and it

increases to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level.

The ability only functions while you are mounted on your dire

hawk steed.

Shield  (Sp):  Upon  reaching  2nd  level,  you  gain  an  innate

ability to withstand incoming attacks from your enemies. Once

per day you can use a shield effect. Your caster level is equal to

your class level. If you are mounted on your dire hawk, the spell

affects both you and your mount, but if you dismount your dire

hawk loses the bene t.

You can use this ability one additional time per day for every

three levels gained above 2nd.

118

Spell Turning (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, you can use a spell

turning effect as an immediate action; the duration is 1 round

or until expended. If you are mounted on your dire hawk, the

spell affects both you and your mount (and you share a common

pool of spell levels affected), but if you dismount your dire hawk

loses the bene t.

You can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one

additional time per day for every three levels gained above 3rd.

Playing a Moonsea Skysentinel

You hate the Black Network, especially those loathsome Zhentarim

skymages, and youve decided to do something about it. You and your

bird like nothing better than taking to the skies and hunting for

Zhents. When the morning is cold and crisp, and your breath frosts

in the breeze, thats when you feel most alive, ready to work. Wing-

ing your way across the foothills or open plains of the Moonsea,

you almost dare a skymage to show his ugly facejust so you can

watch his look of horror when you send him plummeting.

You serve as both scout and cavalry for the rest of the Knights

of  the  North.  Mounted  on  your  trained  dire  hawk,  you  have

the ability to race from one corner of the region to the other,

delivering messages, scouting enemy movement, and guarding the

skies to protect your companions. They may be on the ground,

raiding a caravan or attacking a Zhent envoy, but youre the one

watching their backs.

COMBAT

Lightly equipped to travel fast, you dont like getting into frontal

assaults. Instead, you prefer to rely on your swift mount to get

the  drop  on  your  ground-based  enemies,  coming  in  fast  and

leaving them wondering where you went. Ranged weapons are

your best tactic, and with your innate defensive abilities, you can

avoid similar attacks, making it easy for you to circle the  ght

and rain death from above.

In  the  air,  you  have  a  good  chance  to  deliver  some  hefty

damage  upon  a  Zhentarim  skymage  while  enjoying  a  certain

degree of protection from his spells. As you gain more experience,

your dire hawk can become a lethal force in its own right, and

aerial battles against a skymage and its mount become spectacu-

larand deadlydisplays.

ADVANCEMENT

You were already halfway to becoming a Moonsea skysentinel when

you joined up with the Knights of the North. After you showed

what you could do on the ground, the Knights saw the potential

in you to take to the skies for your joint cause. You are a precious

and rare breedthere arent more than a handful of skysentinels

in existence. You and your companions know how much the rest

of the Knights depend on youand the cost not only to yourself

but to the group as a whole if you get killed or incapacitated.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

At  rst, your superiors will want you to take it slow. They use

you on simple missions, delivering messages, scouting caravan

locations, or occasionally doing some point work for the Knights

own caravans. Until you get comfortable in the saddle, they dont

want you to risk yourself unduly. After all, youre hard to replace.

Once you start to get some battle experience, though, you can

start tangling with the Zhent scum more regularly. Your  rst

 ght with a Zhentarim skymage will be unlike anything youve

experienced before. Remember that you have to deal with him

quickly, before he can use his magic to good effect.

Once you start gaining levels as a Moonsea skysentinel, youre

going to need to make some choices about your combat specialties.

Your dire hawk is a powerful weapon in its own right, so the bonus

feats you select determine how you put your mount to good use.

Your style of  ghting must be predicated on what you know how

to do with Mounted Combat and its related feats.

RESOURCES

Because youre a member of the Knights of the North, you have

access to a wide range of specialty gear for yourself and your

mount. Spend the extra coin on a combat saddle and the other

equipment to help you in battlesthe extra price is worth it.

Also make sure you have the best bow you can, and get a spare;

when you drop your weapon from 2,000 feet above the plains,

you cant pick it up again.

The Black Network may be large and powerful, but it has

many enemies. You can usually  nd someone in the Moonsea

region who is sympathetic to your cause, able to provide you with

spare equipment or a place to hide in a pinch. The Knights of

the North maintain lots of supply caches all over the area, too,

and you can draw on those when the need arises.

Moonsea Skysentinels

in the World

I wouldnt be here if it werent for the skysentinels watching

my  back.  Theyve  warned  me  of  Zhentarim  traps  more  times

than I can count.

Lidrin Garneteye, Knight of the North

The  Moonsea  skysentinel  is  a  paramount  counterpart  to  the

Zhentarim  skymage.  One  offsets  the  other.  If  you  have  a

campaign based around disrupting the foul deeds of the Black

Network, particularly involving the activities of the Knights of

the North, then the Moonsea skysentinel should be available to

even the playing  eld.

DAILY LIFE

As with all the Knights of the North, the life of a Moonsea

skysentinel is hard. Often on the run from pursuing Zhentarim

forces, a skysentinel lives day to day, enjoying the moments when

airborne the most. When hes not on a mission, hes often hiding

in some roosting spot in the hills and lower mountains of the

region. Like the rest of the Knights, a skysentinel has dedicated

his life to righting the wrongs in icted on the common folk by

the Black Network, and he works tirelessly to see that goal met.

There is no other life for him.

As with any airborne branch of a military organization, the

Moonsea skysentinels are a breed apart. They keep to themselves,

seeing their roles as both more dangerous and more glorious than

that of the common foot soldier. In the case of the Knights of the

North, the skysentinels respect their ground-based counterparts

and would do anything to keep disaster from befalling them, but

a skysentinel sees himself as the daredevil hero who swoops in and

turns the tide, saving his friends hides time and time again.

NOTABLES

Although she was not one of the original members of the Knights

of the North, Joatra Stelmar was the  rst member recruited by

the Knights to aid them in their cause. A druid who had a great

rapport  with  several  dire  hawks  nesting  in  the  Dragonspine

Mountains, she took to  ying on the back of one as a means of

surveying the range where she lived. She despised the Zhentarim

skymages who sometimes  ew into her territory, and she never

missed an opportunity to send one careening to his death.

It was only a few years ago that Joatra came to the aid of

a small group of Knights who had gotten caught in a trap laid

for them by the Black Network. Swooping in and catching the

Zhents off guard, she was able to turn the tide of the skirmish.

Though  reluctant  at   rst  to  form  a  permanent  relationship

with the Knights, Joatra eventually agreed to facilitate bringing

Knights with the right temperament together with dire hawks,

helping them form a bond, and training them in the art of aerial

warfare. Now, though she would likely cringe at the appellation,

the Knights consider Joatra to be their master skysentinel.

ORGANIZATION

All  the  other  Knights  of  the  North  who  train  as  Moonsea

skysentinels answer to both Joatra Stelmar and to the leadership

of the organization as a whole. Beyond that, there are too few

skysentinels in existence to organize them further. Instead, an

unspoken understanding exists among all the skysentinels that the

most experienced among them will take on the most dangerous

tasks, and the others accept lesser assignments until they have

proven themselves.

Joastra  doesnt  attempt  to  involve  herself  in  the  military

decisions of the Knights. Her only agenda is to see to it that the

dire hawks are treated well and not put into undue danger. She

understands the need for risk; her knowledge of the Black Network

is suf cient to accept that sacri ces must sometimes be made to

thwart their schemes. But she wont see birds pushed beyond their

limits or sent on suicide missions without very good cause.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

If at any point Joastra believes a Moonsea skysentinel is being

unnecessarily reckless with or unkind to his or her dire hawk, she

will ground that individual until amends are made. The other

Knights  never  question  her  decisions  in  these  matters,  both

because  they  value  her  contributions  to  their  cause  too  much

and because they recognize that she knows what she is doing.

Reparations can be as mild as an apology to both Joastra and

the bird in question or as severe as permanent removal from the

skysentinels.

NPC REACTIONS

Folk who dont know about the skysentinels (and few do who

are not directly in alliance with or opposed to them) are usually

amazed, frightened, and suspicious of these warriors from the sky.

They have seen plenty of evidence or heard plenty of anecdotal

stories  of   ying  Zhentarim  skymages,  and  those  encounters

have never ended well. Thus, unless they are given ample cause

to change their views, people are most likely to be unfriendly or

even hostile in attitude.

On the other hand, most folk who have been rescued from

Zhent brutality by a Moonsea skysentinel appreciate both the

nobility and risk involved in serving as one, and they tend to ap-

plaud the skysentinels efforts and show a friendly or even helpful

disposition. There are a few who understand

the good intentions of the skysen-

tinels but fear the repercussions

of  aiding  them,  and  those  folk  exhibit  unfriendly  or  (rarely)

hostile behavior, as well.

Of course, the members of the Black Network hate the Knights

of the North and want them destroyed. Zhentarim skymages  nd

the Moonsea skysentinels particularly loathsome and take every

opportunity to attack them, hoping to slay both rider and bird.

Each  groups  members  harbor  a  special  enmity  for  the  other

and almost never back down from a potential  ght (unless their

present business is of paramount importance, and any delay or

failure to deliver could be disastrous).

MOONSEA SKYSENTINELS LORE

Characters  can  use  Knowledge  (local  Moonsea)  or  Gather

Information to learn more about the Moonsea skysentinels or

or  paraphrase  the  following,  including  the  information  from

lower DCs.

DC 10: The Moonsea skysentinels are terrors from the sky,

wreaking havoc on all trade in the Moonsea region.

DC 15: The Moonsea skysentinels work with the Knights of

the North to combat the machinations of the Zhentarim, riding

huge birds into battle.

DC 20: The Moonsea skysentinels are an elite corps of scouts,

 ying on dire hawks and dueling with Zhentarim skymages. They

hide out in secret aeries in the mountains and are hard to track

down. The Knights of the North secretly recruit members who

show promise and teach them to become skysentinels.

Cormyr, and the Dalelands, where someone can make it known

that he or she would like to be contacted by Knight recruiters.

This information could include the name of someone to ask for,

though there will always be twists and turns and false dead-ends

to the information trail. The Knights are very cautious, wary

individuals who dont want to be exposed.

Moonsea Skysentinels

in the Game

Any campaign you might be running that takes the characters

into or near the Moonsea region is a prime opportunity to utilize

the Moonsea skysentinels. Whether the PCs are simply traveling

through with a caravan, or they have clashed with the Zhentarim

already and wound up in an ongoing struggle, they are likely to

encounter a group of Knights of the North accompanied by at

least a single skysentinel. If events align to allow one or more

characters to join the Knights of the North, it is feasible that

at least one of those members will be interested in becoming

a  skysentinel.  Even  if  the  characters  arent  recruited  or  turn

down the opportunity, they can on occasion aid a Knight (and

by extension, a skysentinel) or join forces with some to further

a common cause.

Any  player  character  who  becomes  a  Moonsea  skysentinel

will  nd plenty to do in an ongoing anti-Zhentarim campaign.

As a skysentinel, the character can serve as the spy or scout for

a strike team made up of the rest of the characters in the party.

Alternatively, with a smaller group of players, all of them could

become skysentinels and  y missions as a team, relying on their

disparity of skills and talents to still function as a well-rounded

party.  Setting  up  a  large  rivalry  with  a  notable  Zhentarim

skymage, someone who can serve as an ongoing adversary and

torment and thwart the characters as they advance in level, can

give you plenty of adventure ideas.

ADAPTATION

Of  course,  the  Moonsea  skysentinel  concept  doesnt  have  to

be limited to the Knights of the North. If you are running a

campaign in another area of Faern (or in another campaign

setting  altogether),  you  can  easily  adapt  the  class  to  function

as the aerial corps for a military or paramilitary organization.

Alternatively, the skysentinels could just as easily be a solo act, a

group of like-minded combatants who serve their own purposes

and dont answer to anyone else. They could even be a part of

a city watch.

Encounters

Running  encounters  that  include  a  Moonsea  skysentinel  can

be tricky but rewarding. Often, a skysentinel will be part of a

larger contingent of Knights of the North. The characters can

be onlookers caught up in a confrontation between the Knights

and the Zhentarim. For example, they might just happen to be

in a frontier mining town, investigation a nearby dungeon, when

trouble   ares  up  between  the  two  groups.  Alternatively,  they

might be serving as guards of a caravan that the Zhentarim

either  own  or  are  preparing  to  attack,  and  the  Knights  and

skysentinels are opposing them. In most cases, the characters

will likely work with the skysentinels, or at the very least stay

out of their way.

Whatever the reason behind a skysentinels presence, the char-

acter will be most interesting as an encounter if she utilizes her

skills and talents to attack from the air. Whether she is raining

missile  re down on her targets while staying out of reach or

swooping in for  yby attacks, the tactics needed to combat her

need to be clever and unique.

Haelimbrar, Triadic Knight and Servant

of the Lords of Imphras II

Triadic knights are holy warriors who worship the Triad of Tyr,

Torm, and Ilmater. Triadic knights trace their history back to the

Fiend Wars of Impiltur (729732 DR), when the three churches

joined forces to proclaim the Triad Crusade, but they no longer

comprise a single order of paladins. Triadic knights believe that

to truly embody the virtues of a paladin, one must draw on the

strengths of all three gods. Through courage and perseverance,

Triadic knights seek justice for all.

Becoming a Triadic Knight

Paladins,  cleric/paladins,  and  clerics  most  commonly  become

Triadic knights, although many multiclass combinations including

clerics and paladins are represented or have served in the past

among the ranks of the Triads holy warriors.

Depending  on  your  base  spellcasting  class(es),  youll   nd

Wisdom  and/or  Charisma  remains  your  most  valuable  ability

score.  Melee  combat-oriented  characters  should  emphasize

Strength and Constitution, while those specializing in unarmed

combat should focus on Dexterity and Strength, and then Consti-

tution. Spellcasters are best served by emphasizing their primary

mental attribute to maximize the number of bonus spells they

can cast.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Patron Deity: Ilmater, Torm, and/or Tyr.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Feats: Initiate of IlmaterPG, Initiate of Torm (see page 31), or

Initiate of TyrPG; plus Endurance.

Skills: Knowledge (local) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks,

Knowledge (the planes) 2 ranks.

Special: Aura of good class feature.

Class Features

The  Triadic  knights  class  features  combine  elements  of  the

paladin with defensive abilities that allow him to remain at full

 ghting strength even when faced with adverse conditions.

Spellcasting: At each new Triadic knight level other than

1st or 7th, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster

level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a

level in a divine spellcasting class you belonged to before adding

the prestige class. You do not, however, gain all the bene ts

a character of that class would have gained. If you had more

than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a Triadic

knight, you must decide to which class you add the new level

for  purposes  of  determining  spells  per  day,  caster  level,  and

spells known.

Aura of Good (Ex): Your Triadic knight levels stack with other

class levels that grant this ability for the purpose of determining

the power of your aura of good.

Special Mount (Sp): As a Triadic knight, you gain the service

of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed. See the pala-

din class feature, page 44 of the Players Handbook. Levels of

Triadic knight stack with other class levels in classes that grant

this feature for the purpose of determining the special mounts

abilities.

Hands of Ilmater (Su): At 2nd level and higher, you can no

longer become nauseated or sickened.

Shield Other (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, you can use a shield

other  effect  once  per  day;  your  caster  level  is  equal  to  twice

your class level. Triadic knights often call this ability martyrs

embrace.

Eyes of Tyr (Su): At 4th level and higher, you can no longer

become dazzled or blinded (except by physical damage to your

eyes).

Discern  Lies  (Sp):  At  5th  level,  you  become  able  to  use  a

discern lies effect once per day; your caster level is equal to twice

your class level. Triadic knights often call this ability judges

insight.

Smite Evil (Su): Beginning at 5th level, you can smite evil

once per day. See the paladin class feature, page 44 of the Players

Handbook. If you already have this ability from another class,

your Triadic knight class levels stack with that classs levels for

the purpose of determining the extra damage dealt. For example,

a 5th-level paladin/4th-level Triadic knight would deal an extra 9

points of damage with each successful smite evil attempt. Smite

evil attempts per day gained from multiple sources stack.

Heart  of  Torm  (Su):  At  6th  level,  you  gain  immunity  to

fear.

Shout (Sp): At 7th level, you can use shout once per day; your

caster level is equal to twice your class level. Triadic knights often

call this ability lions roar.

Threefold Smite (Su): At 7th level, you can combine three

smite evil attempts in a single attack. Doing this costs you three

of your daily smite evil attempts; if you dont have at least three

such attempts remaining, you cant use this ability. Making a

threefold smite requires a full-round action and triples the bonus

on damage rolls (but not on attack rolls) normally applied with

a  smite  evil  attack.  For  example,  a  5th-level  paladin/7th-level

Triadic knight would deal an extra 36 points of damage (three

times his effective smite evil level of 12th).

Playing a Triadic Knight

You are brave, persevering, and honorable at all times, embody-

ing the traits of all three members of the Triad. You exhibit

more  exibility than most clerics and paladins of lawful good

deities, since you are able to see better than most that some-

times justice must be tempered by mercy, that suffering must

be alleviated through courage, or that obedience must give way

to what is right.

You serve the churches of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater and respect

the commands of their leaders; as you see it, members of each

group have a unique perspective on living a valorous, honorable

life.

COMBAT

You belong in the front line of any combat,  ghting hand-to-hand

with the champion or leader of your foes. Your spells and abilities

allow you to shrug off the lingering effects of most evil magic

and keep going. As you grow in power, your ability to embrace

the suffering of others, ferret out the truth, and roar in the face

of danger make you a natural leader and an inspirational example

for others. Your ability to smite is your greatest weapon, and when

you reach the pinnacle of your power, you can dispatch powerful

creatures of evil with a single blow.

ADVANCEMENT

Becoming a Triadic knight requires dedicating yourself not to

one god, but to three. You must spend time studying the dogma

of all three faiths and understanding how each churchs teachings

strengthens the other two. Although it is not strictly required,

you are more likely to be chosen to join the knighthood if you

exhibit great valor in three separate quests, each one serving one

of the three churches of the Triad.

At  rst, your superiors will want you to rotate among the

three faiths, serving the needs of each church individually. As you

become seasoned, however, they will expect you to identify speci c

weaknesses of each individual faith and bring your understanding

of the rest of the Triads teaching to bear, thus strengthening all

three faiths.

As you continue to serve the Triad, you will be expected to

become a leader of the Triad Crusade, which will continue until

every last  end is banished from Faern. You will be expected to

seek out denizens of the Lower Planes who lurk in Abeir-Torils

darkest shadows and muster the resources of the Triads three

churches to ensure their defeat.

RESOURCES

As a Triadic knight, you are part of a respected knighthood of

champions,  the  living  embodiment  of  the  teachings  of  three

gods. You can expect a warm welcome in good-aligned human

realms, much like that accorded a paladin. As a champion of

three faiths that are closely allied, you can draw on the resources

of all three churches. Spend coin on armor and weapons that

will bene t you in battle. Avail yourself of cold iron and sil-

vered weapons effective against demons and devils, and seek out

powerful magic weapons with bane (evil outsider), holy, and/or

thundering properties.

In the Old Empires of Mulhorand, Unther, and Chessenta,

and  in  nonhuman  realms,  Triadic  knights  are  not  widely

known. However, members of like-minded churches (such as

those  discussed  in  the  Adaptation  section,  below)  are  likely

to give you aid if so requested; to them, a paladinlike knight

who  is  open-minded  about  the  teachings  of  multiple  lawful

and good gods is a refreshing change from most dogmatic holy

warriors.

Triadic Knights in the World

I met a mighty warrior on the road. Her sword was shattered,

her face was scarred, and she carried with her a bloody saddle. I

offered her a ride in my cart, but she graciously declined, saying

that she had to walk the path Ilmater had set before her. Within

her eyes burned a  re the likes of which Ive never seen. This

warrior, I imagined, had fought horrors that would crush the

spirit of any common man.

Arrath Darcylon, the Wandering Bard

Triadic knights are found throughout western and central Faern

in churches and religious orders that embrace the worship of the

three gods of the Triad. They play much the same role as paladins

of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater.

ORGANIZATION

Although Triadic knights once comprised a single order of pala-

dins, Impilturs Order of the Triad, a slim majority of Triadic

knights now are independent agents, acting as lone paladins or

clerics who have embraced the worship of three like-minded gods

with  little  resistance  from  members  of  the  individual  faiths.

Other  Triadic  knights  join  one  of  the  many  knights  orders

dedicated to Torm, Tyr, or Ilmater. The largest concentrations

of Triadic knights are found in Impiltur, as leading members of

the Knights of Imphras II; in Tethyr, as leading members of

the Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin ; and in Calimshan, where

they venerate Anachtyr in lieu of Tyr, as leading members of

the Janessar . Further details on the Knights of Imphras II are

found in Chapter 3.

NPC REACTIONS

Most people regard paladins with a mixture of awe and guilt,

amazed by their bravery and honor, but fearful that they are

being secretly judged. Others simply hate them or view them

with admiration. Triadic knights are viewed much the same way as

paladins, with similar varied reactions. Few observers recognizing

the implications of a paladin archetype embracing three largely

united but subtly different dogmas.

TRIADIC KNIGHTS LORE

Characters  with  Knowledge  (history)  or  Knowledge  (religion)

can research Triadic knights and  nd information on the Triad

Crusade  and  its  aftermath.  When  a  character  makes  a  skill

check, read or paraphrase the following material, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Triadic knights embrace the worship of Tyr, Torm,

and Ilmater, known collectively as the Triad.

DC  15:  Triadic  knights  can  be  found  in  large  numbers  as

members of the Knights Kuldar in Barakmordin and as members

of the Knights of Imphras II in Impiltur.

DC 20: Triadic knights came to prominence during the Triad

Crusade, called by the churches of Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater in the

wake of the Weeping War (711714 YK) to defend Old Impiltur

against an invasion of newly released  ends.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can learn im-

portant details about speci c Triadic knights in your campaign.

Triadic Knights in the Game

Triadic knights play much the same role as paladins, acting as

shining knights who  ght on behalf of the forces of law and

good. However, they show more resiliency than is typical for

paladins,  drawing  on  the  three  tenets  of  perseverance,  cour-

age, and justice to give them amazing strength in the face of

impossible odds.

Its easy to introduce a Triadic knight into an ongoing cam-

paign. If your campaign includes a paladin who venerates Tyr,

Torm, or Ilmater, any challenge that forces him to draw on the

strengths of another god of the Triad might result in a revelation

that leads him to embrace all three gods of the Triad.

This prestige class appeals to gamers who enjoy role-playing

paladins but who seek a more complicated belief-set for the paladin

to adhere to. Triadic knights must balance between the teachings

of the three gods, which share common goals but differ in the

speci cs of how to achieve such goals. For example, a Triadic

knight must weigh the merits of mercy versus duty versus justice

when deciding on the fate of a captured prisoner who seemingly

repents of his crimes at the last minute.

ADAPTATION

The Triadic knight is a fairly speci c class that unites the dif-

ferences of three lawful good gods. This class can be adapted to

worshipers of other pantheons with a strong focus on the twin

tenets of law and good. For example, a dwarf variant of this

class could be created that venerated Clangeddin Silverbeard,

Gorm Gulthyn, and Moradin, emphasizing the three tenets of

bravery, watchfulness, and protection. A Mulhorandi variant

of this class could be created that venerated Horus-Re, Osiris,

and Thoth, emphasizing the three tenets of knowledge, justice,

and life.

Encounters

Facing the loss of two successive boy-kings before their coronation,

and concerned about threats to the imminent coronation of a

third boy king, the Lords of Imphras II have decided to draw

out potential assassination attempts on a false target. The PCs are

recruited to travel north to Heliogabalus, capitol of Damara, and

return to Lyrabar as escorts to a young squire in King Gareth

Dragonsbanes personal service. Although the Lords insist on

absolute secrecy from the PCs, they make little real effort to

keep the mission hidden from other ears.

HAELIMBRAR (EL VARIES)

Unbeknownst  to  the  PCs,  the  young  squire  is  actually

Haelimbrar, one of the Lords of Imphras II, in the disguise of

the long-hidden King Imbrar II. Haelimbrar normally resides

in  the  Impilturan  town  of  Laviguer,  securing  the  northern

and western borders of Impiltur, but he often acts abroad on

secret missions for the Lords of Imphras II. Its up to the DM

whether Impilturs greatest foes, such as Soneillon (see page 135

of Champions of Ruin), fall for the bait or not, but in any event

the PCs are sure to be attacked by a succession of lesser foes of

Impiltur who believe that the seemingly humble squire is actually

the king of Impiltur.

This chapter introduces several locations of inter-

est to playersall places of great power that

confer bene ts upon valorous heroes who visit

them. The DM can drop these places of valor into his or her

existing campaign with minimal effort; these descriptions might

also inspire DMs to create similar sites of their own.

Cave of

Brother Luiman

Nestled in the foothills of the Snow ake Mountains, shrouded

by the canopy of Shilmistra, a small waterfall spills over the side

of a low plateau and into a clear, inviting pool. The pure spring

water trickles forth from a small cave atop the plateau, its mouth

hidden by low scrub brush and overhanging tree branches. This is

the Cave of Brother Luiman, a hermit monk who dwelt here in

solitude two centuries ago. Few today know of the caves location,

and fewer still recognize the healing properties of both the cave

and the accompanying pool.

History

Brother Luiman was a disciple of the Yielding Way, an order of

monks dedicated to Eldath and devoted to peace and protection.

Like many of his order, Brother Luiman traveled the countryside,

gathering information and spreading it elsewhere. But in his youthful

zealousness, he provoked a brawl with a gang of thugs who had been

intimidating folk in Saradush. The fray quickly got out of hand, and

when the dust had settled, a number of thugs and commoners alike

lay dead or near death. Seeing what he had allowed his own pride

and arrogance to do, Brother Luiman  ed the scene.

Unable  to  bear  the  guilt  of  what  he  had  done,  Brother

Luiman retreated to a place of solitude,  nding the cave and

settling there to live for a time while he contemplated his own

127

shortcomings. He prayed to Eldath for guidance, but for a long

time, no insight was forthcoming. Brother Luiman was patient

and repentant, though, and eventually, he received the means

of his atonement in the form of a vision. Eldath instructed the

monk that he should seek out Glorilis Instala, a paladin of Tyr

who was in need of succor and refuge, and return with her to

the secret place where he had dwelt.

Unsure  that  he  understood  completely  the  purpose  of  his

gods command, but trusting that the Quiet One was offering

him that prayed-for chance at redemption, Brother Luiman set

out in search of the woman. He found Glorilis despondent and in

her cups in a dockside tavern in Tethyr. At  rst, she refused his

offers of aid, but eventually the monk convinced the paladin to

return with him. For  ve tendays they spoke, and he learned of

Gloriliss fall from grace. He came to understand his purpose in

bringing her thereit was to be Brother Luimans duty to provide

spiritual healing for folk of many faiths, not just his own. Armed

with this insight, he began counseling the paladin onto a path of

atonement. He set before her several tasks, and instructed her to

return to him once she had completed them. When Glorilis did

indeed return to the secret cave, Brother Luiman invited her to

look into her own heart to see if she had been absolved of her

crimes. It seemed she had.

Guided by Eldaths visions, Brother Luiman aided many more

fallen souls. Each one was coaxed into visiting the cave, and each

one received his guidance and inspiration before going out into

the world once more, intent on seeking atonement. And in each

case,  the  healing  and  absolution  was  only  complete  upon  the

travelers return to the cave.

PLACES OF VALOR

Game Effects

Anyone approaching within 50 feet of the cave entrance feels an

almost preternatural sense of peace and tranquility come over her.

This effect is essentially a permanent calm emotions spell (Will

DC 27 negates). It suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale

bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, as well

as negating a bards ability to inspire courage or a barbarians

rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the

confused condition from all targets. While within the affected

area, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect, but it takes hold

of the creature again once that creature leaves the area, provided

that the duration has not expired in the meantime.

Keyed Locations

Refer to the accompanying map for each of the following points

of interest at the plateau and spring.

1. ENTRANCE PATHWAY

The path is soft and spongy from the fallen leaves and loamy

earth,  and  it  winds  among  a  sun-dappled  array  of  deciduous

trees spaced far enough apart to see the sky overhead. Anyone

strolling on the faint trail can hear the merry splashing of the

waterfall long before they can see it. Right as the pool becomes

visible just between the last few trees, the path splits into two

directions, one heading straight toward the pool (area 2), the

other toward the rough natural rock formation leading up to

the plateau (area 3).

2. ICY POOL

A small waterfall tumbles over the side of a 20-foot-high escarp-

ment of rock that juts out from a much larger and equally steep

cliffside. It splashes into a small, clear pool at the base of the

protrusion of rock, which over ows near the opposite end and

trickles through a gap in the rock formation and continues on its

way into the forest. The water is icy cold and perfectly clear.

Anyone drinking from the water is immediately healed of 1d8

points of damage (if any). Should someone chose to brave the chill

and bathe in the pool, 5 minutes spent in the water also provides

the bene ts of the remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, and

remove disease spells. A character can gain any of these bene ts

once every month. Any water taken from the pool will function as

a cure minor wounds spell for 24 hours (regardless of how much

or how little is drunk), after which it loses its magical potency.

3. ROCK FORMATION

The very end of the plateau is fractured and separated slightly

from the main formation, leaving an upward-jutting  nger of

rock that the elements slowly smoothed and shrank. The result

is  a  crumbled  mound  of  rock  divided  into  distinct  shelves,  a

PLACES OF VALOR

natural staircase rising from the ground. The stream that exits

the pool passes between this staircase of rock and the plateau to

the north. At the top of the formation, a graying, roughly hewn

split log bridges the gap.

4. CAVE MOUTH

The top of the plateau is  at and smooth, and a shallow  re pit

stands near the center of it, scorched black from many years of

use. The branches of a number of large trees hang over the place,

partially sheltering it from direct sun. The mouth of the cave is

low and wide, and the water that spills into the pool below trickles

out along one side of the opening. Anyone taller than a gnome

or hal ing must stoop or crawl to gain access to the chamber

inside. Just beyond the mouth, the passages ceiling rises high

enough that any Medium creature can stand upright.

5. BROTHER LUIMANS CAVE

The cave is a simple  ssure in the rock, with a slightly sloping

 oor and a cold spring-fed stream  owing along the low wall.

The stream gushes forth from an even smaller crack in the rock,

and the chill of the water makes the temperature of the cave

considerably cooler than the outside air. All in all, it is a rather

austere place to live.

Any paladin or cleric of a good-aligned god who has fallen

from grace in some manner and spends one tenday sleeping and

meditating within the cave can receive the bene t of an atone-

ment spell. Such a character  rst receives a vision from Eldath

on a course of direction to attain such atonement. The required

action is always in the form of a quest, the details of which are

left up to the DM to decide. Upon satisfactory completion of

the quest, the character in question must return to the cave and

meditate for another full 24 hours, at which point the characters

own patron deity grants the atonement.

It is not without precedent for more than one fallen paladin or

cleric to reside in the cave at the same time. The place has enough

room for three to four people at once, but any more than that makes

the conditions rather cramped. When there are multiple occupants

in the cave, Eldath has been known to issue them both a common

vision,  requiring  that  they  cooperate  in  their  quest  and  return

together to receive their individual pardons. In this way, Eldath

subtly cultivates cooperation between the faiths, furthering her own

aims at peaceful coexistence without the need for violence.

Chapel of

Resounding Justice

Southeast of Archenbridge in Sembia is a small forti ed chapel

to Tyr, built in the middle of an open  eld in an otherwise unre-

markable area. It is a lesser-known pilgrimage site for those of the

Tyrran faith, especially paladins, and for those who believe their

lives are a worthy price to pay to maintain justice. Measuring

60 feet on a side and just under 20 feet tall from the ground to

its parapet walls, the chapel is simple mortar and stone, with an

iron plaque of Tyrs hammer-and-scales holy symbol above the

double-door entrance on the south face. During the day a  agpole

holds a Tyrran  ag in blue and white.

The remarkable feature of this chapel is a statue in the courtyard

of a large winged humanoid carved out of white marble veined

with gold. She stands with muscles tensed, greatsword held high in

one hand, her other hand pointing down toward the earth, as if

issuing a command or making a stern vow. This statue is actually

the petri ed remains of Resounding Justice, a noble planetar in

service to Tyr who gave her life to defeat Krysus Vaant, a blackguard

of Gargauth, and his pit- end ally known as Ten ames. The site

thrums with the power of Tyr, radiating outward from the statue

to just beyond the outer corners of the chapel.

Like any place holy to Tyr, the chapels keepers offer sanctuary

and aid to Tyrrans in need, though they are a small garrison and

prefer that military assistance from the church come from one

of the larger temples in the nearby cities. Any follower of Tyr is

welcome to stay in the chapel for one night; the keepers welcome

offers to help guard or improve the site from those skilled in war

or craft.

History

In 1295 DR, a young Sembian noble of a minor house inherited his

familys estate after an unfortunate boating accident. This noble,

Sterth Zelgarik, quickly squandered his familys money on lavish

parties and expensive courtesans. Faced with dwindling coffers and

the prospect of actually having to work for a living, he became

desperate,  and  when  a  clever  follower  of  Gargauth  approached

him about a special business deal guaranteed to make him rich

again, he accepted. This sly priest led him by the nose through

one misfortune after another, getting him to promise more and

more to the outcast devil-god until Sterth owed Gargauth body and

soul. The deity reshaped him and gave him a new name, Krysus

Vaant, and used him to terrorize political enemies and prick at

the heels of good of cials who refused to deal with his agents.

After dozens of offenses and blasphemies against the church of

Tyr, the most powerful Tyrran priest in Saerloon petitioned his

god to send a champion to defeat the vile blackguard.

Tyr sent Resounding Justice, a young planetar of auspicious

lineage, to deal with Krysus Vaant. The planetar found the Sem-

bian noble outside of Archenbridge and harried him southward

over the course of several days, as the blackguard used vile magic

to speed his way or leave terrible casualties behind him that the

angel was obligated to stop to help. Eventually Resounding Justice

managed to hold him in place with a spell and swooped in to

put the man to the sword, but the blackguard had a blood pact

with the pit  end known as Ten ames, who appeared just as the

planetar was about to smite the mortal. Angel and devil battled

and the pit  end wore away at Resounding Justice. Realizing she

couldnt defeat her enemy with conventional means and knowing

that Krysus Vaant would soon shake free of her spell, the planetar

stood tall in the fading sunlight, pointed her sword at heaven, and

sacri ced her own soul to power an incredible blast of white holy

energy that engulfed the pit  end and the blackguard,

consuming  them  until  nothing  was  left

but a foul cloud of smoke that

drifted away in the breeze

(some  in  Sembia  believe

the smoke cloud still exists,

bearing the minds of the

pit  end and blackguard,

whispering  dark  secrets

to  those  who  listen  in

exchange  for  binding

oaths).

name of Tyr and justice.

Game Effects

The statue radiates magic and gentle holy power.

Its effects  ll a sphere just larger than the outermost corners of

the chapel walls, though enemies of the chapels defenders rarely

see the bene t of its powers.

At  night  the  statue  gently  glows  with  a  blue-white  light

equivalent to a torch.

While in this temple, clerics of Tyr can prepare spells from

the Good domain as if they had that domain. Tyrs clerics who

already have the Good domain can use nondomain spell slots to

prepare spells from the Good domain. Noncleric divine spellcast-

ers can prepare spells from this domain as if they were on their

spell list at the equivalent level of the Good domain (so a paladin

could prepare holy smite using a 4th-level paladin spell slot). These

prepared spells remain prepared even after the caster leaves the

chapel.

Anyone dying within the area automatically stabilizes without

needing to make a stabilization check. This ability does not prevent

creatures from dying outright (such as from a wound bringing

such as poison or disease.

Any creature that rests here regains hit points as if it were

Keyed Locations

Refer to the accompanying map

for each of the following points

of interest within the clearing.

1. ENTRANCE

This heavy door is reinforced

with iron and has a bar on the

inside. It is normally kept closed

but not barred.

2. COURTYARD

This  area  holds  the  statue-

form of Resounding Justice.

Those who touch the statue

say they can still feel her

angelic presence, and some

believe she is actually alive in some

kind  of  stasis,  waiting  for  the

right time to awaken and serve

Tyr again. Some Tyrrans propose

 nding  a  way  to  restore  her  to

life, but traditionalists believe that

would undermine the message of her

sacri ce and possibly undo the magic

that destroyed her enemies.

3. BARRACKS

This simple barracks holds two double bunk beds for the chapels

normal contingent of guards (human or half-elf  ghter 2). They

are armed with longswords and shortbows and wear chainmail

and large steel shields when on duty. Other than their armaments

they carry little, seeing no need to drag material goods to this site

where they lead simple lives serving Tyr in an honorable duty.

4. CAPTAINS QUARTERS

Traditionally the captain of the chapel is a paladin of Tyr. In

recent years the captain has been Randal Whytstone (LG male

aasimar paladin 4 of Tyr), raised as a foundling by the Tyrran

temple in Selgaunt.

5. SHRINE

While residents and visitors often pray at the feet of the statue,

actual worship and giving of offerings takes place in this small

room set aside as a shrine to the god of justice.

6. PRIESTS QUARTERS

The chapel normally has a cleric on duty for religious services

and magical support. The current resident priest is Miri Buckman

(LG female human cleric 4 of Tyr), whose parents  ed Tethyr

during the Interregnum.

7. STORAGE

This room holds enough dry goods to support the six permanent

residents for several weeks, and enough water for a week.

8. ARMORY

Just in case they need to arm an in ux of defenders against a

siege, this armor holds a dozen suits of chainmail, large wooden

shields, shortbows, longswords, maces, and about two hundred

arrows.  Since  the  inhabitants  of  the  chapel  bring  their  own

gear, this room is usually kept closed and is only inspected and

inventoried once a tenday.

9. ROOFTOP VANTAGE

Because the ceilings of the rooms underneath these four points

are 15 feet tall, the chest-high (to a human) parapet walls here

are almost 20 feet from the ground. The parapets only circle

the outside walls, allowing easy viewing to anywhere within the

open area of the chapel. The parapets continue along the narrow

walkways connecting the corner landings.

Cullrin Fields

On a lonely, windswept plain, the ruins of an ancient structure

slowly vanish beneath the shifting soil and the tall grasses of a single

hill. But a few sun-bleached columns still jut up from a cracking

foundation, defying time. Around the ruins, neat and orderly mounds

protect them, angled like spear points out toward the open  eld

beyond. This is Cullrin Fields, an ancient battle site in the Shaar that

still holds the haunting memories of its long-dead soldiers.

History

In the Year of Spoiled Splendors (211 DR), a tribe of humans

known  as  the  Arkaiuns  faced  an  onslaught  of  Untheric  and

Mulhorandi armies against their city of Shandaular, where the

present-day Council Hills sit in the middle of the Eastern Shaar.

In an effort to repel the invading armies, the Arkaiuns built

numerous outlying forti cations away from their city, where they

hoped to be able to repel their northern enemies. Cullrin Fields

is the remains of one such outpost.

The Arkaiun army at Cullrin Fields was outnumbered and

overmatched, and the outcome was truly never in doubt. But the

Arkaiuns knew this before they even arrayed for battle. Their

job was not to win, but to delay the enemy until the people of

Shandaular  could  retreat.  The  Arkaiuns  took  their  positions

behind the earthen ramparts, bows and spear gleaming in the

sun. Their battle-wizards  ung spells at the advancing ranks of

Untheric and Mulhorandi soldiers as the call of the clarions and

the pipers inspired the Arkaiuns to hold their positions.

The soldiers defending their homeland fought valiantly but were

soon overwhelmed. The enemy from the north cut them down to a

man as they fell back from their earthen ramparts, trying to make

a  nal stand within the columned outpost. At the end of the day,

the land was soaked in blood and the city of Shandaular was ripe

for the taking. But the ghosts of the Arkaiun army would not be

denied. Though they had been defeated in battle, they would not

surrenderto death or to the enemy. Their spirits still haunt the

ruins, ready to answer the call of the horns once more.

Game Effects

Whenever a bard character of good alignment is standing within

the ruins (the shaded area 3 on the map) and uses his bardic

music class ability to inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire

heroics before a battle, he automatically summons a number of

good-aligned ghosts (see the sample ghost on page 117 of the

Monster Manual) that  ght with him and his allies. The number

of ghosts that appear is equal to twice the bards class level. The

ghosts remain until all the bards enemies within 300 feet of the

ruins are defeated or they are destroyed. A bard can summon

ghosts in this fashion at this location once per month.

Keyed Locations

Refer to the accompanying map for each of the following points

of interest at the battle eld and ruins.

1. ARCHERY REDOUBTS

Each of these locations marked on the map is a defensive posi-

tion protected by earthen mounds that come to a height of 4

feet. The sides of each mound facing away from the ruins are

grass-covered slopes now, but during the original battle they

had wooden stakes embedded in them. Now, incorporeal ghost

touch stakes jut from each of the redoubts, further protecting

the positions.

The mounds are treated as dif cult terrain for the purpose

of moving across or over them, coming from either direction.

They are also considered low walls for the purpose of cover. It

costs incorporeal creatures 4 squares of movement to pass over

a redoubt, and they cannot run or charge over one.

2. EMBANKMENTS

The ruins of the outpost were built on the side of a gently slop-

ing  hill,  and  the  earth  was  reworked  to  create  embankments,

making it more dif cult for enemies to assault the position. These

embankments are treated as dif cult terrain for the purpose of

uphill movement only.

3. RUINS

What remains of the ruins of the Arkaiun outpost is overgrown with

grass. A landslide from the north in ancient times, and the continued

encroachment of the earth after that, have left the northern and

westerm portion of the foundation covered in soil and vegetation. Some

of the stone columns in the area thats still accessible have toppled and

are now half-buried in the soil. Some patches of weather-worn white

stone can be seen, with just a hint of markings on the various surfaces,

but these are crude images worn away beyond recognition.

The column standing near the southwest corner of this area

is actually a runic marker spell (see page 57) set to trigger if any

creature of evil alignment steps upon the foundation of the ruins (the

shaded area). The glyph portion of the marker deals sonic damage.

Darkmaidens Leap

In the northern reaches of the High Forest, southeast of Ever-

lund, is a small clearing bearing a large gray stone with a  at

top bearing a single left footprint the size of a drow womans

foot. The clearing is free of undergrowth and is well trod with

the passing of animal and humanoid footfalls. Many folk camp

here, not knowing the sites signi cance but liking its access to

moonlight and easily defensible position at the top of the rock.

To those who know its power and history, the Darkmaidens Leap

is a sacred place to Eilistraee. Though a holy place to the drow,

its guardians are usually wood elves, grudging allies of the areas

good-aligned drow in service to the Dark Maiden. Depending on

the time of year, visitors can  nd it empty or secretly watched.

History

For many centuries the stone bore no footprint and the area

was known to the local people as Hastrins Grayrock for an elf

ranger who lived in the area and used the place as a waypoint and

landmark for allies and visitors. It had no special powers and was

unremarkable save that the clearing was large enough to permit

sunlight and moonlight to reach the forest  oor in this place.

In 1358 DR the Time of Troubles shook the world, and many

dark elves  ed their cities for a time in the wake of wild magic,

Planar Touchstones

Planar touchstones are special locations  rst described in Planar

Handbook. Usually they are on other planes, but some have been

found on the Material Plane that holds Faern. Canny travelers

can attune themselves to one or more planar touchstones by using

the Planar Touchstone feat (see Planar Handbook). Doing this

gives a character a minor ability relating to that touchstone.

If the proper triggering conditions are met at the site of a

touchstone (usually involving a ritual or sacri ce appropriate to

the site or its creator), the traveler with the Planar Touchstone

feat gains a more powerful ability that has a limited number

of uses. The traveler can continue to return to any touchstone

and  reattune  herself  as  often  as  she  wants,  as  long  as  she

performs the necessary recharging condition; doing this resets

her number of uses of that touchstones major ability to the

default amount indicated for the touchstone. A traveler cannot

increase her number of uses of a touchstones major ability

beyond this maximum by repeat visits; each visit returns her

number of uses to the default amount and no greater. There

is no limit to the number of characters who can bene t from

a touchstones minor and major powers as long as they each

take the Planar Touchstone feat.

A planar touchstone is usually an encounter site, since like-

minded people gather there to protect the site from despoilers

or hoard its powers for themselves. New visitors to a touchstone

must battle or negotiate with any current residents, which may

or may not be there if the traveler returns at a later date.

Initial Encounter: Roll on the Darkmaidens Leap encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. The wood elf scouts are

suspicious of everyone but more inclined to accept elves and

half-elves. The drow pilgrims are most likely visitors from

the Promenade. The drow raiders are non-Eilistraeean drow

investigating drow appearances in the area. The treant behaves

much like the wood elves.

battling avatars, and with house wars unrestrained by the threat of

opposing clerics. A group of such drow were driven far from home by

angry monsters and encounters with larger forces that whittled their

numbers to just thirteen. Disoriented and lacking anywhere else to

go until the world settled on its foundations again, the drow followed

the tunnel until it reached a wall of vines blocking entry to a larger

area. Cutting through the vines, the dark elves found themselves on

the surface world, unable to see the bright moon overhead because

of the dense foliage. Hearing music, they investigated and found

an old drow woman dancing at Hastrins Grayrock, music coming

out of the air itself with no obvious source.

Surprised and confused, the dark elves watched the old woman

dance, fatigue and years marring the smoothness of her intended

movements. As the woman danced, she began to grow younger,

gaining strength and suppleness, and slowly a vision of another

drow woman, beautiful and ever young, appeared above the rock,

leaping, singing, and shining with a great light. The  rst woman

continued her dance upon the rock, and when she became as young

as one who had just reached adulthood she began to fade away, still

dancing with joy. The shining woman turned her attention to the

Underdark drow, and her visage hearkened their hearts back to

something ancient in their blood, a time before Lolths corrup-

tion of their  esh and minds. They understood that they beheld a

goddess, not someone terrible to be feared, but strong and loving

and beautiful in a way that the Spider Queen could never be.

In their hearts they converted to the worship of the Dark

Maiden. Casting off their armor, they danced with her, and while

they danced she spoke to them of other good drow, of safe places,

and their constant  ght against Lolth. They told her they wanted

to live and die in her service, and she transported them to a safe

place outside the Promenade, her temple near Skullport. Nine of

these drow are still alive today serving Qilue at the Promenade;

they try to return to Darkmaidens Leap once a year to pray

and dance (it was on their  rst such return trip that they found

her footprint at the top of the rock).

A few years later the drow found a small troop of wood elves

at the site, surrounded by a large number of orcs from the Spine

of the World. The drow aided the wood elves and managed (in

broken  Common)  to  establish  a  truce  without  any  bloodshed

between elfkind. Now the wood elves watch over the site for the

drow, who use a set of hand signals to show they serve Eilistraee

rather than one of the evil drow deities (though dancing in the

moonlight is usually the  rst indicator of who they are). The

wood elves dont necessarily like the drow, but see that they arent

despoiling the forest or waging war on its non-evil creatures, so

they tolerate the arrangement.

the rock. First, divine spellcasters who worship Lolth take a 1

penalty to their caster level (minimum 1st). Second, all creatures

in the area gain low-light vision (the range of this improved vision

extends beyond the edge of the clearing as long as the creature

remains within the clearing). Third, any drow who visits this

place  for  1  hour  or  more  can  change  to  good  alignment  and

the  worship  of  Eilistraee  without  penalty,  as  described  in  the

atonement spell description and on page 232 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting; undergoing this change ful lls the

requirement of performing a quest for Eilistraee.

Darkmaidens Leap is a planar touchstone, giving extra powers

to characters who know how to attune themselves to such sites

(see the sidebar for more information on planar touchstones and

the effects of this particular touchstone).

The stone is the location of two keyed portals. The  rst is a

two-way portal that connects this area with a small side cavern

near the Promenade; the key is a drow casting a moonbeam spell.

The second portal is one-way, and leads to Eilistraees realm in the

plane of Arvandor; the key is a drow casting a moon path spell.

When either portal is activated, the stone becomes the window of

the portal and the portal glows (silver for the Promenade portal,

green and silver for the Arvandor portal).

Keyed Locations

Refer to the accompanying map for each of the following points

of interest within the clearing.

1. LEAPING ROCK

This rock is 5 feet in diameter and about 6 feet tall,  at at the top

and easy to stand on without risk of falling. There is only enough

room at the top to hold one Medium creature comfortably. Two

Small or Medium characters can occupy the rock at the same

time, but neither of them can move freely enough to engage in

combat until one of them leaves the rock. Any creature on the

rock has line of sight to all creatures in the clearing.

2. CLEARING

Though the trees in the vicinity of the Leaping Rock are as tall as

any others in the High Forest, the upper branches of these trees

have not grown out and over the clearing. Because of this, creatures

in the clearing (roughly a 20-foot-radius area around the Leaping

Rock) have an open view of the sky, and when the moon shines at

night the entire glade is illuminated with silvery radiance.

3. SECRET TREE BLIND

This large tree contains a simple wood platform built by the wood

elves. Because of careful pruning of the trees to the northwest, a

creature on the platform can see the Leaping Rock and the 5-foot-

radius area around it. The wood elves use this platform to watch

over the rock, and if they see strangers visiting the clearing, the

lone scout stationed here runs to gather allies for a confrontation

(resulting in the wood elf encounter described above).

Mholor Durinhal

Along one out-of-the-way passage running through the deep halls

of the Great Rift is a smaller side passage that seems almost out

of place. Nothing marks the tunnel as signi cantno carvings

or signposts, no great valve or heavy portcullis to seal it off.

Any folk choosing to follow the tunnel quickly  nd themselves

on a narrow unadorned causeway crossing the middle of a great,

yawning chasm. Overhead, down below, and to either side, black-

ness stretches away seemingly forever. The only indication that

the bridge actually goes somewhere is straight ahead, where a

towering,  at-topped outcropping of rock juts up. This is Mholor

Durinhal, a most sacred shrine to Clangeddin Silverbeard.

History

Mholor Durinhal sits in the middle of a great chasm that joins

the upper reaches of the Underdark to the lowest levels of the

Great Rifts subterranean passages. If one were to survive the

fall from the oval-shaped platform to the bottom of the chasm

some 1,700 feet below, one would discover numerous passages and

routes leading even further down into the bowels of the earth.

The far side and the ceiling of the natural  ssure are both too

distant to be seen by any normal means.

According to certain gold dwarf historical annals, the spit

of rock jutting out into the yawning blackness once looked very

different. At one time, the approach to the point was broad and

 at. But the histories say a great paladin of Clangeddin Silverbeard

named Felskal Frostdelve of the Misty Caverns made a valiant

 nal stand on that point against a swarming horde of foul trolls

that had invaded from the depths below.

The histories only reveal that Felskal fell in battle, but the

legends claim that he held his ground for four days while a practi-

cally endless stream of the nasty beasts clawed and clambered up

the sides of the outcropping of rock, trying to reach the embattled

dwarf. For four days, Felskal held them back, sending the trolls

tumbling over the sides time and time again. But there seemed

to be no stopping them. They amassed for one last surge, hoping

to overwhelm the dwarf once and for all.

Feeling his strength giving out and knowing his doom was at

last upon him, Felskal called on Clangeddin to lend him one last

bit of divine power. The Rock of Battle granted Felskals request,

and  with  that   nal  surge  of  energy,  the  mighty  dwarf  hero

slammed his twin axes into the very rock, embedding them there.

With that last supreme effort, Felskals heart gave out, but the

blows were so profound that a great cacophony of metal ringing

on stone erupted all around the fallen dwarf. The sound shook

the entire cavern, and  ssures formed in the outcropping. Just as

the swarm of trolls closed in around Felskals body, celebrating

their victory, the sides of the outcropping sheared away, taking

the trolls with them in a deadly tumble of stone shards.

The only thing remaining was a narrow jut of stone, a pin-

nacle that held Felskals body aloft, out of harms reach. The

fallen heros remains were never recovered; the legends say that

Clangeddin appeared on that point himself to gather his noble

servant and take him to his  nal rest. The axes, however, are

another story. They were left behind, jutting from the stone, as

a testament to Felskals courage and relentless determination.

Afterward, the gold dwarves constructed the causeway and

stairs to connect their halls with the point of rock where the

axes rest. Clangeddins clergy came and consecrated the area and

pronounced that the site was holy to the Father of Battle. It was

made into a shrine dedicated to the deity.

Game Effects

Though Clangeddin is a god of battle, he views the shrine as a

place for quietude, a place where dwarves should come to re ect

upon battles fought and battles yet to come. Thus, anyone stand-

ing upon any portion of the bridge and stairs, as well as at the

shrine itself, is treated as under an effect similar to that of a

sanctuary spell. Such an individual cannot attempt to strike or

otherwise directly attack another creature, even with a targeted

spell, unless he succeeds on a DC 25 Will save. If the save fails,

he cant follow through with the attack, that part of his turn is

lost, and he cant directly attack the warded creature so long as

he remains in the affected area. Unlike a normal sanctuary spell,

this effect does not permit any attacks by area or effect spells.

However, subjects can use nonattack spells or otherwise act.

Keyed Locations

Refer to the accompanying map for each of the following points

of interest along the causeway and at the shrine.

1. ENTRANCE

At this point, the tunnel leading from the main passage within

the  depths  of  the  Great  Rift  ceases,  opening  into  the  chasm.

The path leads onto the  rst bridge, which is only 5 feet wide

and without railings. The open darkness is oppressively silent,

expanding  out  in  every  directionabove,  ahead,  and  out  and

down to either side. Ahead, torches  icker from a wider point

along the bridge (area 2).

2. GUARDIANS

At this point along the bridge, the path widens to a circular area

15 feet in diameter. Unlike the bridge itself, this portion has a

banister encircling it, and torches are set into the railing every 5

feet. Two statues of dwarf warriors stand watch,  anking the path

that runs down the center of the circle. The statues are actually

battle ef gies (see page 153) placed here to ward the route. They

have been instructed to attack any creatures that have an alignment

other than lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good that attempt

to pass between them. They can sense such a creatures approach

and are considered to have readied an action to move to intercept.

They are not affected by the sanctuary-like conditions of the shrine.

They have been constructed with maximum hit points.

Battle Ef gies (2): hp 90 each.

3. COLONNADE

After ascending the  rst set of stairs, visitors pass through a

circular colonnade. In the center of the  oor of this rotunda

sits a slab of stone bearing an adamantine plaque. The plaque is

inscribed in Thorass runes and reads in Dwarven, Before you lies

a place of glory and valor, for in Clangeddin Silverbeards name,

Felskal Frostdelve of the Misty Caverns went to his rest having

acquitted himself in  ne fashion. May he forever be remembered

as hero and trollbane.

4. SHRINE

At the top of the  nal staircase is a small platform of worked

stone. Just beyond it, a narrow shard of natural stone juts up

slightly. Embedded in that shard of stone are two  ne battleaxes,

each made of polished steel and etched with runes. The runes

proclaim in Dwarven that the weapons belong to Feldrir, son of

Felmir the Bold, of the Frostdelve clan of the Misty Caverns.

The handles of the axes are crossed about halfway down their

length, with the heads pointing away from the viewer. They are

polished to a bright sheen because of the constant buf ng they

receive from those who caress them during visits.

The blades bite deeply into the stone, and a DC 50 Strength

check would be required to remove one of them. However, anyone

attempting such an act will suddenly  nd himself facing off against

a pair of shimmering, glowing battleaxes that hover in midair and

immediately attack. These are the results of two spiritual weapon

spells, each with the following attack and damage  gures:

Spiritual Battleaxes (2): +30/+25/+20/+15 (1d8+5/3 of force

damage)

The twin axes attack each round until the offender is either

dead or has left the causeway, at which point they wink out, ready

to appear again. Simply touching the real axes does not trigger

the spiritual weapon effectthe offender must actually attempt

a Strength check to pull one of the axes free.

A legend lore spell cast upon the axes reveals that most of the

legend of Felskal Frostdelve is true, and also that the axes were

a matching pair of +3 mighty cleaving giantbane battleaxes. The

magic of the weapons dissipated when they were driven into the

stone, though, and they are completely inert now.

Any dwarf who has Clangeddin Silverbeard as his patron deity

and who prays at the shrine for 5 minutes receives the bene t of

an aid spell for 24 hours afterward, gaining a +1 morale bonus

on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects. This

effect can be renewed once every tenday.

Teumyshaaril

In the heart of the High Forest, near the ancient elven tree-city

of Teuveamanthaar, a great oak broods, sheltering the forest  oor

and even the other trees of the forest beneath its massive canopy.

The trunk of this great tree is as wide as a small hamlet, and its

crown soars as high as a hilltop. Hidden inside is Teumyshaaril,

an ancient temple dedicated to Rillifane Rallathil. Though the

elves who created it disappeared with the coming of the darkness

from Hellgate Keep, the druids of Tall Trees have maintained it

as a site sacred to the Lea ord ever since. Now, with the return

of the elves, the temple may see steady use once more.

History

Teumyshaaril was originally a natural  ssure in the great tree,

a scar from its earliest days, from long before the elves ever

found it. The scar became diseased, and the disease invited pests,

giant wood-boring beetles that began to eat the tree from the

inside out. When the moon elves from nearby Teuveamanthaar

of Eaerlann discovered its sickly condition, they quickly eradi-

cated the pests and disease, but instead of healing the scar, they

learned from divine insight that the tree was sacred to Rillifane

Rallathil and that it should become a shrine dedicated to the

Lea ord. They began to widen the wound, lovingly cutting and

shaping the wood in such a way that they actually strengthened

the living tissue, completely cutting away the taint left over

from the blights that had af icted it. When they were done,

it became a holy site, preserved and protected by their magic.

The shrine was a magni cent thing, carved entirely from the

wood itself, with no additional materials necessary to form or

furnish it.

The elves did this millennia ago, at the height of their empire,

when Teuveamanthaar blossomed, long before the fall of Hellgate

keep. They made the temple a blessed place,  lled with magical

warmth and joy, an inspiration to all who entered with a love of the

woods in their heart. The script that covers the walls make up the

teachings of Rillifane, parables and dogma, insight and prayer.

When Ascalhorn fell and the demons inside poured forth,

the elves knew that Teuveamanthaars days were numbered. Not

wishing to see their temple de led by the  ends, the elf clergy

spoke to the tree, asking it to seal the entrance to the temple, to

hide it away from all who would bring it harm. The great tree

complied, shifting its bark ever so slightly so that the passage

was shut and the temple locked away.

PLACES OF VALOR

It was only years later that the druids

of Tall Trees (see page 75) discovered

the shrine. They had sensed for some

time that there was something special

about the giant oak. The temples magic

called to them, but they did not under-

stand the signi cance of the sight until

Turlang, the great treant and their ally,

aided them in coaxing the tree to open

up once more. Inside, they discovered

not only the holy site, but also a number

of ancient Eaerlanni artifacts that had

been hidden away inside the temple for

safekeeping.  The  druids  kept  those

treasures inside the temple until the

elves began to return.

Game Effects

There  are  a  number  of  powerful

divine magical forces in effect upon

and with the tree, as well as a handful

of other features present.

To begin with, an area centered on

the heart of the tree and projecting in

a radius 15 feet beyond its outer bark

provides a series of effects similar to

those  of  a  holy  aura  spell.  First,  all

good creatures within the affected area

gain a +4 de ection bonus to AC and

a  +4  resistance  bonus  on  all  saves.

These bene ts apply to all attacks,

not just attacks from evil creatures.

Furthermore,  any  creature  warded

by  the  effect  gains  spell  resistance

25  against  all  evil  spells  and  spells

cast by evil creatures. Third, all types

of protection and mental in uence are

blocked,  as  per  the  protection  from

evil spell. Lastly, if any evil creature

succeeds on an attack against another

creature inside the protected area, that

offender  suffers  is  blindced  as  by  the

blindness/deafness spell (Fortitude DC

22 negates). The tree itself is protected

by these same defenses.

Keyed Locations

Refer  to  the  accompanying  map  for

each of the following points of interest

within the tree-temple.

1. ENTRANCE

Near the base of the tree, where gar-

gantuan roots spread from the trunk

and vanish into the soil, a small tunnel

hollowed out of the thick underbrush

disappears into the wood. It is nestled

in a small hollow of the great tree and

obscured by low foliage that blankets

the loamy earth all around the base

of the trunk. The tunnel is dif cult

to  see  from  a  distance  for  anyone

not  already  aware  of  its  presence;

anyone approaching to within 20 feet

of the entrance can attempt a DC

20 Spot check to discover the open-

ing. Anyone who moves to within 5

feet of the entrance spots the opening

automatically.

2. PASSAGE

The  wood  inside  the  tunnel  has

been  lovingly  shaped  and  worn  to

a  golden  color;  clearly,  this  pas-

sageway is not simply a scar in the

wood. Four steps lead down at the

entrance  before  the  passage  turns

to  head  more  directly  into  the

center  of  the  tree.  The  passage  is

narrow, only 5 feet across and half

again as high, with a rounded arch

forming the ceiling. The wood that

forms  the  inner  walls  of  the  pas-

sage  and  the  chambers  beyond  has

been treated with both magical and

mundane hardeners so that the  rst

2 feet of its thickness is equivalent

to  stone  in  terms  of  hardness  and

hit points. The walls of the tunnel

are perfectly smooth, polished and

 nished to a glossy sheen.

34. STAIRWELLS

Perhaps one hundred  fty paces in and

after a couple of turns, light becomes

evident  deeper  down  the  passage.

The  tunnel  penetrates  the  tree  to  its

heart, where it becomes a winding

staircase leading up. Small alcoves

positioned  along  the  outer  circle

of the spiral stairs glow warmly with

the light of cool, smokeless torches (everburning torches). The

staircase winds for two complete turns (areas 3 and 4), then

rises from the  oor of area 5.

56. LIVING ALCOVES

This larger chamber is open and soaring, with more light illumi-

nating the entire place. A winding staircase follows the outer wall

of this tall, elegant room, rising up with a balcony to protect it on

the inner side. All along the stairway, set into the outwall, are a

series of alcoves. The alcoves have been sculpted to seem like the

insides of tree branches, large enough for any elf to walk inside

and stand easily within. The walls of these alcoves have been  nely

etched with ancient script and panoramic imagery. The script is

Espruar and in the language of the moon elves. The images are

woodland settings, glades and meadows or deep forested hollows

 lled with joyful, laughing, frolicking beasts and fey creatures.

A sense of peace and serenity permeates the place.

7. STAIRWELL

This winding staircase is similar to areas 3 and 4, joining area

6 with area 8.

8. CATHEDRAL

The stairs  nally end in another chamber, a circular cathedral of

sorts. Again, the outer wall is completely decorated with ancient

elven texts and imagery, while a set of columns surround the central

portion, where a raised font rests. The entirety of the place is softly

lit by more of the magical smokeless torches, set in rings about

each column. The entire chamber seems to pulse with a soft light

that comes from everywhere and nowhere. The raised font has a

depression in the center surrounded by raised sides. It is  lled with

a warm amber liquid, the source of the light. More of the honey-

brown stuff seeps from a narrow  ssure in the ceiling and drips

down into the poolsap from the very heart of the tree.

The sap is highly magical. Somehow, the tree never seeps more

sap than is needed to  ll the basin. The sap itself seems to glow

with an inner illumination. Any person of good alignment who

tastes the sap  nds it to be sweet like honey; furthermore, for

24 hours afterward, that person is considered to be the recipient

of a barkskin spell as if cast by a 12th-level druid (and granting

a +5 enhancement bonus to natural armor). The bene t of this

effect can be gained once per week.

Any weapon dipped in the tree sap gains the merciful special

ability  for  24  hours  (it  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of  damage,

and all damage it deals is nonlethal damage). The weapon is not

otherwise  considered  magical  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction. This weapon effect can be renewed once every

week, as well.

Any sap removed from the temple loses its luster as well as

its magical properties.

PLACES OF VALOR

The Weeping Garden

From time to time, those in the service of Ilmater  nd themselves

overwhelmed by foes or a multitude of sufferers too vast to effec-

tively aid. When such a crisis occurs to dedicated knights, priests, and

other truly devout followers of the Crying God, they sometimes  nd

themselves on the receiving end of succor. Ilmater has been known

to provide sanctuary during truly dire circumstances, inviting his

most sel ess and earnest servants into his private garden. Those

who visit never forget the Weeping Garden of Ilmater.

History

The  history  of  this  particular  form  of  Ilmaters  benevolence

is sketchy at best, for no one knows how long the Broken God

has permitted select followers to wander into his private garden.

Furthermore, few who are blessed enough to visit the garden admit

it openly afterward, though those who do often speak of it only

in hushed tones to dear companions, claiming that a sense of

privacy seems to pervade their memories of the place. The only

facts that everyone seems fairly certain of are that Ilmater him-

self is the only one who can allow access to the garden, and that

the garden is located within the Hall of the Triad. Some of the

legends actually claim that paths lead from the garden to other

parts of the Triads home plane, though these assertions have yet

to be substantiated by anyone who actually traveled there.

Game Effects

Being welcomed into the Weeping Garden is both a great honor and

a weighty responsibility, and Ilmater does not choose among his

faithful lightly. Only those who demonstrate ultimate sel essness

on his behalf are granted such a boon. Such acts might include

defending a group of helpless folk against an overwhelming host,

exhausting oneself and all of ones magic trying to provide aid to

plague victims, confronting superior servants of Loviatar regard-

less of the peril, or perhaps pursuing a just cause of kindness across

half of Faern without regard to ones personal safety or advance-

ment. Receiving an invitation to the Weeping Garden should always

be as a result of game play rather than random chance, and should

never occur more than once in a characters life.

Arrival within the garden occurs as the result of a temporary

portal appearing in the characters midst. Regardless of the actual

surroundings, the portal takes the form of a simple garden path

framed by a hedge that grows up and over the top of the route.

The path disappears through the hedge-gate and vanishes into a

thick mist, but warm, inviting light, as if from the late afternoon

sun, makes the mist glow. This portal entrance might appear in

the depths of the Underdark, in the middle of a gloomy swamp,

or along a treacherous and narrow mountain trail heading over a

pass. It is up to the characters to decide whether to step through

or  not.  Once  one  chooses  to  do  so,  all  her  companions   nd

themselves on the path, their former surroundings vanished.

The garden is a place of ultimate assuagement and serenity,

and anyone arriving instantly understands that she is safe while

there. Though she might have just left some disastrous peril only

moments before, a guest of Ilmater intuitively knows that this

side journey is all a part of the greater good. The exact details

of the visit may not yet be clear, but visitors always recognize

that all is as it should be upon arrival.

The conditions within the garden are perfect. The temperature

is balmy, and a gentle zephyr languidly rustles the leaves on the

trees and bushes within. It is a sunny day with blue skies beyond

the hedges, but the light is dappled rather than harsh. It is a

perfect recipe for a lazy afternoon nap.

At  least  one  guest  in  a  group  will  always  have  Ilmater  as

her patron deity, but her companions may be welcomed into the

garden as well. Usually, this occurs when the entire group has

acted benevolently in aid of the servant of the Crying God. Rarely

does Ilmater separate his followers from their companions, so if

one of his own is accompanied by those not worthy of a visit to

the garden, none of them receive an invitation.

For the duration of the guests stay, all spells and abilities they

possess are treated as functioning at two levels higher than the

characters actual level; for characters who have Ilmater as their

patron deity, these spells and abilities function at three levels higher.

This bene t pertains only to spells and abilities that are in keeping

with Ilmaters doctrines and beliefs. Should anyone attempt to cast

spells or use abilities that are in opposition to Ilmaters agenda,

the entire group is instantly and irrevocably ejected.

Assuming the characters are not forcibly removed from the

garden for violating its tenets while there, when they do leave,

they gain the bene ts of a greater heroism spell as if cast by a

20th-level cleric, as well as spell resistance 10. Thus, each character

gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks,

immunity to fear effects, and 20 temporary hit points, Both of

these effects last for 12 hours (rather than the normal duration

given in the spell description).

Furthermore, time passes differently in the garden than on

the Material Plane. No matter how long his guests choose to

remain within the garden, the moment they venture past the

misty gateways (see area 1 of the map), they  nd themselves back

where they were before, with no time having pastand hopefully

well rested and rejuvenated for the coming trials.

Keyed Locations

Refer to the accompanying map for each of the following points

of interest within the garden.

1. ENTRANCES

A high, thick hedge forms a barrier around the perimeter of the

garden, rising 10 feet above the grassy ground. There are four gaps

in this hedge, one at each of the cardinal points of the compass,

squarely in the middle of each wall of hedge, which rises into

140

PLACES OF VALOR

an arch across the top of the path, forming a gate. These four

gaps are  lled with mist that is impenetrable to the eye and rises

to the same height as the hedge. Beyond the hedge, visitors can

see the cloudless blue sky, though if they attempt to peek over in

some fashion, all they spot at eye level downward is more mist

stretching on forever, as though the garden sat at the very top

of the highest mountain peak and the whole rest of the world

was hidden beneath a solid cloud covering.

A soft, loamy path emerges from the mist at each location,

and it is from here that visitors  rst arrive within the gardens

con nes. When a visitor chooses to pass through a hedge-gate a

second time, attempting to leave the garden, she  nds that the

path takes her back to where she had been before, and the route

to the garden has disappeared behind her. Regardless of which

path she chooses, she almost always returns to the Material Plane

at the same spot she left it. On some extremely rare occasions,

one or more of the paths may instead clear of mists and lead

characters to other parts of the House of the Triad.

2. STATUES OF LAMENTATION

A set of eight statues forms a circle around the center of the

garden here. Each one is made of white marble veined in blue

and depicts a human  gure. Half the statues are male and half

female, with alternating genders along the compass points. Each

 gure is of a common person, simple folk in simple garb, and

each one weeps real tears, which cascade down their faces to fall

to the path at their feet.

3. CENTRAL POOL

In the center of the garden is a pool and fountain. The fountain is

simplistic, an upward spray without ornamentation, but the water is

sweet and pure. Anyone who drinks it immediately senses its magical

powers, understanding that, to gain the full effects, he or she must

also eat from the fruit of the trees (area 4). A character gains no

other direct bene t from the water except a pleasant quenching of

thirst. When taken together, the fruit and the water provide the

bene t of a heroes feast spell as if cast by a 20th-level cleric.

4. FRUIT TREES

A large, healthy fruit tree is positioned in each of the four corners

of the garden. No single kind of fruit grows upon any given tree,

however. Instead, each tree provides whatever fruit may be most

desired by any character, so that the trees branches are laden with

a visual cornucopia of different fruits. Anyone taking even one bite

of this fruit immediately senses its magical powers, understanding

that, to gain the full effects, he or she must also drink from the

pool (area 3). A character gains no other direct bene t from the

water except a healthy meal. When taken together, the fruit and

the water provide the bene t of a heroes feast spell as if cast by

a 20th-level cleric.

This chapter is intended more for the DM than

for the players, because it describes several NPCs

and  monsters  that  the  DM  might  want  to

incorporate into an existing campaign. The NPCs and

monsters presented herein were designed to serve as

allies, cohorts, mounts, and animal companions

for valorous heroes. A DM can

also  le the names off these

characters and creatures and

use their statistics to represent

other characters and creatures

in the campaign.

NPCs

The following nonplayer char-

acters make excellent contacts

and  cohorts  for  valorous

heroes.

Bakra Hispul

Bakra Hispul

Found separated from his tribe and wandering

alone as a child, this ogre was taken in by the

druids of Tall Trees to be raised rather than killed. The woodfolk

soon discovered the likely cause of the childs separation when his

 rst temper tantrum revealed his lycanthropy; he transformed

into a hulking dire bear. After calming the creature enough to

avoid harm coming to either party, the druids attempted to cure

him. They discovered that he was a natural lycanthrope and could

not be freed from the condition, so they chose to help him make

the best of it. His name means Bear-man of the wood in the

language of the druids.

As he grew older, Bakra learned the ways of the forest and

of the balance of nature. But despite the druids efforts, he was

too  restless  to  remain  within  the  community  at  all  times,  so

they began to provide him with the more

martial skills he would need to become

a  ranger.  Finding  the  life  of  a  lone

woodsman much more to his liking,

Bakra  excelled  at  tracking  and

survival  in  the  forest.  When  a

pair  of  druid  companions  were

slain  by  feyri  during  a  journey

to  another  part  of  the  High

Forest,  Bakra  dedicated  himself

to opposing the daemonfey, and

has actively worked against them

ever since.

Bakra has adopted many of the

qualities of his animal side in his

manner,  dress,  and  physical  de-

scription. His hair is shaggy and

brown, and he wears a thick beard

that almost completely covers his

face. He prefers little clothing, wearing only

a pair of buckskin breeches and a fur-lined cloak when its cold.

He is very gentle by nature, but when his anger is roused, he

becomes as grumpy as a bear, roaring challenges to his foes as

he rears up, brandishing his twin axes menacingly. To those he

calls friend, Bakra is a steadfast and trustworthy companion, but

to his enemies, the werebear is a formidable foe.

against anyone who would consider de ling it. Along with his

brown bear companion, Bakra appears from the depths of the

Brenvol Whitebrow

Brenvol is a loyal servant of Selne and a proud member of the

Fangshields (see page 78). His mother Brena is the alpha female of

the White Pack, the gray-and white-furred good-aligned Selnite

lycanthropes of the Fangshields; his mother taught him the

responsibilities of leadership, and most of the pack assumes

hell take over their group when his mother dies. He has

spent his entire life in the wild and feels claustrophobic

inside buildings (though not inside caves or other natural

enclosed areas). Friendly and outgoing, he believes

that he and his pack are proof that Selnes light

can shine on the hearts of all evil lycanthropes

and turn them to good. A skilled hunter, he prides

himself on his ability to track down any animal

or evil lycanthrope. He is also a reasonably good

cook, and often uses camp meals to get to know

people better. Like all members of the White Pack,

be believes that af icting a creature with lycanthropy

without  its  permission  is  abhorrent,  and  he  takes

care  to  kill  any  creature  he  bites  to  prevent  an

involuntary infection.

Brenvol (Bren to his friends) is in his

early twenties, has graying hair lightened

almost to white in some places by the

sun (a trait many in his pack have),

and a strong tan and ruddy cheeks.

His nose is long, and his forehead

is high. Built long and lean like a

hungry wolf, he likes to ornament

his clothing and weapons with custom-made

silver coins stamped with Selnes symbol. He

wears studded leather armor and carries a shortbow and mace;

many of his arrows are silver-tipped on the off chance he might

meet an evil lycanthrope.

Brenvol is the Fangshields liaison to the shapechangers of

Faern, and with his speed, tracking skills, and personality he

is often the contact person for new recruits. Brenvol has many

friends among the Fangshields, and there are few who wouldnt

rush to his side if they knew he needed help. Of the three Fang-

shields members most likely to interact with the PCs (see also

Dalthyria and Stormwing, later in this chapter), Brenvol is the

sneakiest, and if called for help he is likely to bring the entire

pack to ambush the opponents of the one in need.

Breyarg Stonebreaker

Breyarg was born in the Great Rift in 1306

DR. Like many dwarves born in that year,

he has a twin. Breyarg and his brother

Dyarg  came  to  the  Vilhon  Reach

a year ago under orders from their

temple  in  the  Great  Rift.  Breyarg

is friendly and outgoing to visitors,

and  enjoys  welcoming  other  gold

dwarves and shield dwarves to his ter-

ritory. He is particularly interested in

talking with any female gold dwarves

who come to the area, for he and his

brother  want  to  marry  and  settle

down some day.

Breyarg  is  slightly  taller

than  a  typical  gold  dwarf,

with tan skin, ruddy cheeks,

short black hair, and a well-

groomed beard. His helm is

steel,  and  its  half-mask  is

made of bronze like his gods

holy symbol. The bronze half-mask symbol is on his

shield, under which is the eye-gauntlet of Helm (showing his

service to Helm but his devotion to Gorm Gulthyn).

As a member of the Fellowship of the Purple Staff, he is

sworn to defend the dwarves living in what will become the

Holy Realm. Breyarg reports to the church of Helm, watching

over the mixed-race communities in the forest and mountains

but keeping a close eye on the welfare of the dwarf miners.

Unof cially, the senior Fellows consider Breyarg the liaison

to the dwarf community, and hopes that his pleasant manner

and skills encourage other dwarves to make homes in the area.

Any  prospective  dwarf  Fellows  meet  with  Breyarg  at  some

point, and if he thinks the prospect is suitable, he recommends

them to the senior Fellows.

Dalthyria

Dalthyria

Dalthyria  is  a  military-minded  female  centaur,  a  veteran  of

combat, and is unafraid to lead a charge against the enemy. The

mother of two, she lost her third foal in a hobgoblin attack and

thereafter trained in war so she could avenge her dead offspring.

She is coolly friendly toward strangers but very suspicious and

hostile toward orcs, goblinoids, and similar humanoid creatures

prone to evil. While much of her day is spent caring for her

children, she tries to practice with weapons each day, and spars

with  other  centaurs  (and  wemics,  on  the  rare  times  the  two

groups meet in numbers) to keep  t. Since her son and daughter

are offspring of the leader of the Fangshields centaurs (as are

many other young centaurs in the area), she has a small

amount of political in uence over her sometime mate,

though she rarely uses it.

Clad in chainmail and car-

rying  a  lance  in  addition  to

the traditional centaur weapons,

Dalthyria is an imposing  gure of

a centaur, especially when charging

at top speed. Originally rather husky,

her  softer  curves  are  gone,  worn

away by hard training, though she is

still quite attractive to other centaurs

because of her obvious strength and  tness.

She took it upon herself to train her

two  children  in  warfare,  and  both

are  nearing  adulthood  and  looking

forward to joining the Fangshields like

their  mother  (though  she  is  unhappy

with  this  idea).  Because  she  wears

horseshoes  of  speed,  she  is  the  fastest

member of her troop.

Dalthyria is an able lieutenant among

the centaurs. Her skill in combat coupled with her natural inclina-

tions to guide and protect others make her a good of cer. She takes

orders well but is capable of showing initiative when she needs

to. With her magically enhanced speed, she is a great messenger,

a spear point for  anking maneuvers, and the best choice for

hunting down a  eeing enemy. Though Brenvol (see page 144)

and his friends are the best at quiet maneuvers, Dalthyria excels

at leading a company of centaurs into open battle, crushing evil

under their blades, arrows, and hooves.

Shiverock

Dorgafal is a rock gnome born

and  raised  in  Shadowdale.

Even  as  a  child  he  had  an

interest  in  stories,  and  he

studied to be an actor and

orator.  As  an  adult  he

traveled over most of western  Faern, collecting stories, news,

and building a general dislike of Zhentarim and the Cult of the

Dragon, both of which tried to kill him when he interfered with

their operations. Dorg joined the Guardians of the Weave for the

opportunity to trade information with other wanderers and to

stick a  nger in the eyes of the kind of mages who made his life

extremely dangerous. Dorgs patron is Oghma, but his cousin is a

priest of Baravar Cloakshadow, and through him the Guardians

maintain good ties with gnome communities.

Dorg is an average-sized rock gnome, with tan skin, red hair,

blue eyes, and a short black beard. He dresses in comfortable

leathers and a mithral chain shirt. Hes exuberant, talks with

his hands, and enjoys practicing his vocal range by using dif-

Kerri Talindras

Kerri is a Cormyrean half-elf, daughter of a

human seamstress and a moon elf adventurer

with a taste for exotic fashions. She takes after

her father in looks and attitude, and left home

to join the church of Sune as soon as she was old

enough. It is her personal goal to rid the world

of ugliness, and she uses her beauty and magic to

show people the need for love and passion in the

world. She joined the Fellowship of the Purple

Staff so she could play a part in creating

a  land  where  people  could  be  passionate

about each other and their work.

Kerri  looks  like  a  tall  moon  elf,

with  pale  skin,  black  hair  with  a

silver patch in front, and gold-

 ecked blue eyes. She is petite,

and  while  she  is  attractive,

some would say she is cute in

a tomboyish way rather than

beautiful. Like her father, she

dresses in fashionable clothes, not letting her small-town back-

ground keep her from looking her best. She is easily recognized

by her brilliant red cloak of resistance that bears a minor magical

effect allowing her to change its cut and embroidery in small

ways to suit the rest of her apparel.

Kerris role in the Fellowship is to explain to visitors the plan

for the Holy Realm and  nd out how they might help that plan

come to fruition. She is very charming and affectionate, and not

averse to an overnight stay with an attractive guest. Kerri is an

honest person and not the best judge of character when it comes

to dealing with attractive men; as such, the Fellows take any of

her recommendations for new members her with a grain of salt,

AGENTS OF GOOD

but  they  appreciate  her  ability  to  settle  disputes  and  establish

friendly contact with newcomers.

Ramas-Teth Ankh

Ramas-Teth is a Mulhorandi diviner and worshiper of Thoth. The

second son of a powerful trading family, he used his inherited

wealth to pay for his magical training,  nishing his studies well

ahead  of  schedule.  Ramas-Teth  is  accustomed  to  dealing  with

foreigners  and  people  of  power,  speaks  several  languages,  and

keeps an excellent library at his personal estate. As an adventurer

in the Old Empires, he has had several hostile encounters with

Thayan wizards, and this experience made him determined to

oppose their plans whenever possible. He sought out Aluvauna

in Arabel after a long journey, and is the  rst from his land

to join the Guardians of the Weave.

Like all wizards in Mulhorand, Ramas-Teth marks his

forehead with two concentric circles, though unlike

most  he  actually  tattooed  them  there  as  part  of

a third eye symbol representing his focus on

divination magic. He is a tall, thin man with

sallow  skin  and  brown  eyes;  he  has  black  hair

but shaves all of it. He wears simple clothing of

 ne silk and a large amount of jewelry. Ignorant

folk might think him a Red Wizard, but he never

wears red and lacks the abundant tattoos common

to Thayan mages.

Ramas-Teth  is  a  skilled  diplomat  and  helps

smooth tensions between western and eastern mem-

bers of the group. His command of many languages

means he can converse with almost anyone without

using magic. Most of the organizations informa-

tion on wild magic and dead magic areas comes

from his own library, and he keeps copies of

the  groups   ndings  at  his  home.  Though

technically not a lieutenant, he is

well respected and has  lled in

for the Skuld lieutenant from

time to time. He enjoys making scrolls,

and takes it upon himself to make copies of western

spells his Mulhorandi associates might  nd useful.

Rindon Wasatho

Rindon is the son of a Tashalan wine merchant and a Cormyrean

traders widow. Having grown up hearing his fathers tales of the

sneaky yuan-ti and their humanlike guises, Rindon is cautious

about  giving  his  trust  and  friendship.  He  is  known  to  quietly

observe a person for several days (whether in town or the forest)

before deciding to talk to him or her (sometimes using Tashalan

divination cardsa gift from his fatherto determine when and

if he should speak). He spends most of his time on the fringes

of the settlement, since he doesnt like sleeping under a

roof. Rindon has proven his loyalty to the Fellowship

of the Purple Staff time and again, and is their most

trusted agent. Though a servant of Selne, like his

fathers people he has a great respect for Savras

the All-Seeing. He isnt very talkative and tends

to lead by example.

Rindon  has  black  hair  and  near-olive

skin,  and  because  he  is  short  and  wiry

some  mistake  him  at   rst  glance  for  a

wild elf. He dresses in woodland colors

and carries a Tashalan crossbow and a

dwarf-made short sword. His animal

companion is a bloodhound.

Rindon  is  a  scout,  guide,  and

spy for the Fellowship. He patrols

the edges of the groups territory,

leads  newcomers  through  the

forest to the settlements, and watches

prospective  and  new  recruits  for

suspect behavior. Because he knows

Sarade Gedreghost

Sarade is a Halruaan transmuter and a member of the Guard-

ians of the Weave who enjoys keeping an air of mystery about

herself.  The  name  she  uses  is  almost  certainly  an  alias  (as

common  as  Dorn  Buckman  is  in  Cormyr),  but  Aluvauna

trusts her absolutely, accepting her as one of her  rst recruits

to the cause. Sarade has refused positions of authority several

times in the organizations short history, because she is one of

those  unusual  Halruaans  who  prefers  action  and  exploration

to research and solitude. Sarade is a devout follower of Azuth

and it was her efforts that convinced Aldym the White

(a  Halruaan  white  necromancer  follower  of

Velsharoon) to join the Guardians.

Sarade  is  a  tall,  fair-skinned  woman  with

black  hair  and  blue  eyes,  easily  recognized

by her unusual staff and the alterations she

made to her body sometime in her past. Her

left eye is gone, and the socket glows with a

grayish  light  (though  this  light  vanishes

when  she  wills  it,  revealing  only  a  gray

haze   lling  the  socket).  Her  right  hand

is gone, replaced with an animate gray

stone hand that hovers just above her

smooth wrist. The left-hand mate

to this stony hand  oats above her

staff and sometimes moves on its

own accord, pointing out things

of interest.

Sarade is a newsbearer, guide,

scout,  and  battlemage  for  the

Guardians. As one of the mem-

bers  with  access  to  the  teleport

spell  (which  she  prepares  every

day), she is often called for backup

in dangerous situations. She likes

taking new members under her wing and giving them minor one-

use magic items to help them accomplish their  rst few tasks for

the Guardians. Her wooden staff can shoot rays of  re.

Stormwing

Stormwing is an adventurous young giant eagle, a member of

the Fangshields and part of the Stormwind Aerie. It is a tradi-

tion for eagles of his aerie to give their offspring the names of

ancestors, and Stormwing is the third to carry that name. Because

both previous bearers became mighty heroes, his fellows expect

similar things from him and he is more than ready

to ful ll their expectations. Stormwing travels far

in search of people who need help, and he has

extensive contacts with rangers and druids

in nearby lands as well as members of the

Harpers, Emerald Enclave, and even a

progressive  Thayan  wizard  traveling

in the Western Heartlands. On his

own he has faced down ogres and

even a solitary wyvern, and once

snatched  a  Zhentarim  skymage

off  the  back  of  her  mount  and

let her plummet from a great

height.  He  loves  to  dive  and

spin, and is known as the demon

Sky-Feather to several tribes of

evil  humanoids  he  likes  to  chase

and accost to abandon their evil ways

(his  magic  ring  helps  him  maintain

an  image  of  a  magical  creature  to  the

superstitious humanoids).

Stormwing has brown feathers over

most  of  his  body,  with  lighter  brown

feathers on his head, neck, and chest.

His beak is yellow-brown, his eyes are

black, sharp, and  erce, and his feet

and legs bulge with mighty tendons.

His claws are the same color as his

beak, and he sharpens them on rocks

daily. He wears a magic gold ring on

one  claw  that  lets  him  turn  invisible

once per day; like his name, this ring is passed down from genera-

tion to generation. When he knows he must carry someone for

an extended period of time, he usually wears a simple harness

across his back or holds a hammock in his claws so his guest is

comfortable.

Stormwing and the other eagles in the group are the aerial

soldiers of the Fangshields. When  ying predators such as wyverns

and small dragons enter Fangshields territory, the aerie assembles

to drive them away or kill them. They have also been called to

rescue friends in dif cult places or steal away enemy leaders in

the  middle  of  battle  for  negotiations.  If  the  White  Pack  (see

Brenvol, page 144) are the ambushers and the centaurs are the

cavalry, the eacgles are the air support, sending daggers of terror

into enemy hearts as he and his fellows swoop down out of a

cloudy sky. He is the natural choice for a speaker to new  ying

members to the group and is more than willing to guide them,

often testing their  ying skills as he does so.

its body to deal terrible blows, but it does not pursue trespassers

that retreat.

A  battle  ef gy  is  about  4-1/2  feet  tall  and  weighs  500

pounds.

COMBAT

A battle ef gy has one goal and one goal only: to prevent pro-

hibited creatures from getting past its position. Its attacks are

straightforward, pounding against whatever foe is closest to it.

When it has no foes to attack, it simply returns

to  its  position  and  awaits  its  triggering

condition once more.

Construct Traits: A battle ef gy

is immune to mind-affecting

spells  and  abilities,  poison,

sleep,  paralysis,  stunning,

disease,  death  effects,  nec-

romantic  effects,  and  any

effect that requires a Fortitude

saving  throw  unless  it  also

works on objects. It is immune

to extra damage from critical

hits, nonlethal damage, ability

damage, ability drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or energy drain. It

cannot heal damage, but it can

be repaired. A battle ef gy has

darkvision out to 60 feet and

low-light vision.

Stun (Ex): Any creature hit

by  a  battle  ef gys  attack  is

stunned for 1 round (Fortitude

DC 17 negates). The save DC is

Strength-based.

Battle ef gy

Fast  Healing  (Ex):  A  battle

ef gy regains lost hit points at the

rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst,

or suffocation, and it does not allow a battle ef gy to regrow or

reattach lost body parts.

Equines

Equineshorses, donkeys, mules, zebras, and poniesare found

in many varieties across Faern, each bred for a speci c task.

Perhaps surprising to some, most of the best horse breeders are

humans. Dwarves and gnomes have never found it easy to bring

horses into the Underdark, elves favor magical mounts (most of

which make even the most prized horse seem rather mundane),

hal ings have proven happy with the efforts of the humans, and

orcs prefer less domestic mounts, such as war pigs and worgs.

and a battleaxe, crouched in a

defensive  stanceat  least  until

it  suddenly  shifts  position,  blocking

A  battle  ef gy  is  a  construct  developed  by  dwarves  and  used

to guard signi cant locales within their underground domains.

Usually constructed to appear as stout dwarf warriors armed with

traditional weapons and wearing heavy armor, battle ef gies are

often decorated with clan insignias and runes to proudly proclaim

to all who has made them.

Most  of  the  time,  a  battle  ef gy  stands  dormant,  a  mere

decoration set up alone or in matching pairs along hallways and

 anking doorways leading into vaults and crypts. However, under

certain conditions designated by its creator, a battle ef gy shifts

position and attempts to block the passage or doorway that it

guards. It battles relentlessly using the weapon crafted as part of

As a general note, equines are measured in hands (where a

hand  equals  4  inches),  and  height  measurements  refer  to  the

distance from the ground to the horses withers (shoulders), not

to the top of the head.

Most breeds of equines in Faern are identical in price and

characteristics with one of the various kinds of equines described

in the Monster Manual, as detailed here.

Heavy  horse  breeds  include  Cream  draft,  Sembian  draft,

Amphailan, Miradans, Tendals breed, and Phlan cart horse.

Heavy  warhorse  breeds  include  Amphailan  black  charger,

Ostorian, and Tantran destrier.

Light horse breeds include Fox Trotter, Baldurian riding horse,

Mintan  riding  horse,  Darromar,  Shire  rider,  Halruaan,  New

Forest, Esmel long rider, Barrowright farm, and Mucklestone.

Light  warhorse  breeds  include  Golden  Trotter,  Duskwood

Skewbald, Ixinosia Longhair, Vilhon riding warhorse, Ember-

hawk, and Thayan Black.

Pony breeds include Orsraun pony, Snow ake Mountain pony,

Nether pony, Forest pony, Sunrise pony, and Shire pony.

War pony breeds include Hammer war pony and Whiteshield

war pony.

Faern has several unique equine breeds as well, each of which

is in some way or ways an exception from the norm. These unique

breeds are described below.

AMPHAIL GRAY

This variety of equine, bred exclusively in Amphail far to the

north, is famous across Faern for being loyal and hardy. These

dappled gray light horses stand 16 hands (5 feet 4 inches) at the

withers and are otherwise unremarkable in appearance. Neverthe-

less, they are highly priced, averaging 225 gp.

Amphail Gray (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except +2

Con, +2 Wis, +2 Cha.

CALIMITE

Coming out of the Calim Desert, these horses are said to be blessed

with the speed of great Calim himself. The Calimite is one of

Faerns most famous horses, known for its great speed, endur-

ance, and pure breeding. The breed is further distinguished by its

beautiful and delicate head, large and prominent eyes, arched neck,

deep chest, silky coat, full mane, and high tail carriage. Standing

14-1/2 hands (4 feet 10 inches) high, these light warhorses can

be chestnut, gray, bay, or black with black and white markings

on the face and legs. These beasts are highly valued and highly

priced, averaging 1,650 gp.

Calimite (CR 1): As light warhorse (MM 274) except speed

70 ft., +2 Con.

CHIONTHAR

Named for the region of its prevalence, the Chionthar is known

by a variety of names, including the Reaching and the Cormyte

riding  horse.  It  is  popular  throughout  both  the  Western  and

Eastern Heartlands, and quality ranches are known in Hluthvar,

Iriaebor,  Asbravn,  Arabel,  Waymoot,  and  Harrowdale.  The

Chondathans of the Vilhon Reach originally bred this light horse

centuries ago; the Chionthar shows the in uence of the Calimite

and  the  Dambraii.  Cormyreans  perfected  the  breed.  It  stands

16 hands (5 feet 4 inches) at the withers, has a long neck, and

a digni ed head with widely spaced intelligent eyes. Coat colors

include bay, dark bay, chestnut, black, and gray; white markings

are common on the face and legs. This horse is strong and swift,

as well as easily trained. Not much of a workhorse, the breed is

especially prized by travelers and messengers. A solid but common

horse, the Chionthars sale value averages about 200 gp.

Chionthar (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except speed

70 ft., +2 Str, 2 Wis. Any character riding a Chionthar gains a

+1 bonus on Ride checks.

CORMYREAN DESTRIER

The Cormyrean destrier is perhaps the  nest heavy warhorse in

all of Faern. The breed is relatively new; King Azoun I ordered

and supervised their breeding sometime around 400 DR from Nar

and Tharurr stock. Although it is now encountered throughout

western and northern Faern, the best Cormyrean destriers are

still found on the ranches outside Arabel and Waymoot. Cormyre-

ans are the most commonly depicted warhorse among castle and

palace wall tapestries across much of Faern. Outside of Cormyr,

the Cormyrean destrier can also be found as a workhorse pulling

beer wagons and heavy plows. A mature stallion stands 17 hands

(5 feet 8 inches) high and can weigh up to 2,200 pounds. It has

wide-set, expressive eyes and a noticeably convex nose. It is often

bay, brown, black, or gray, and usually costs more than 1 gp per

pound, averaging 2,500 gp.

Cormyrean Destrier (CR 2): As heavy warhorse (MM 273)

except +2 Str, +2 Wis. Any character riding a Cormyrean destrier

gains a +1 bonus on Ride checks.

DALES PONY

The  Dales  pony  goes  by  many  names  throughout  the  Dales,

Moonsea, the Vast, and Damara. These ponies work on farms

and ranches, in mines, and for merchants throughout the region.

Having been mixed with ponies and horses of almost all breeds,

the Dales ponys appearance is as varied as the species of horses,

although they are often piebald or skewbald. Nevertheless, the

breed maintains its superior survival traits, a powerful jump, and

sure-footedness. Standing 12 hands (4 feet) high, the Dales pony

is also a popular training pony among the wealthy of central and

northeastern Faern. These highly prized ponies cost 120 gp.

Dales Pony (CR 1/4): As pony (MM 277) except +2 Con; +2

riding a Dales pony gains a +1 bonus on Ride checks, and Handle

Animal checks made against a Dales pony receive a +2 bonus.

DAMBRAII

Dambraii  steeds  are  prized  throughout  the  Shining  South.  A

Dambraii that leaves Dambrath is considered the equal of any

light warhorse found elsewhere. In truth, those who manage to

get their hands on a purebred Dambraii horse will  nd it tough,

fast,  and  easy  to  train.  However,  only  the  poorest  horse esh

actually leaves Dambrath. Someone facing a troop of Dambraii

cavalry quickly learns that the best horses are kept in Dambrath.

A cavalry troop on Dambraii horses can move at a speed that is

unheard of by any other cavalry troop. They are all battle trained

and very dependable in combat. Dambraii riders are almost never

thrown, at least while their horses still live.

It is interesting to note that the superior qualities of Dambraii

horses are reduced outside their land. Perhaps this is proof that

arkas grass (which grows only in Dambrath) was indeed created

for horses. Horses fed on arkas grass during the  rst years of

their lives become superior animals; this is a little-known secret

outside of Dambrath. The horses of Dambrath are smaller than

usual, standing only 13-1/2 hands (4 feet 6 inches) high. They

are always piebald or skewbald, generally, white on black, or black

on white. Browns and grays do exist, but are rare. These amazing

steeds sell for 1,800 gp.

Dambraii (CR 1): As light warhorse (MM 274) except speed

70  ft.,  +2  Dex,  +2  Con.  Handle  Animal  checks  made  against

a Dambraii gain a +2 bonus, and it can be trained in half the

normal amount of time.

HAMMER PONY

Bred for strength and endurance by the gold dwarves of the Great

Rift, the hammer pony is equally at home on the surface or in the

depths of the Underdark. This breed stands 12 hands (4 feet) in

height and has a large, muscular frame that can easily support the

weight of a fully armored dwarf. Colors range from golden brown

to black, although the mane and tufts of hair around the ankles

are always blond. The hammer ponys favorite food is fungus of

any sort, although it will feed on grass if that is all that is avail-

able. This breed is little known outside the Shaar, because it is

rarely available for sale outside of the trading town of Hammer

and Anvil where the gold dwarves offer their wares. A hammer

pony sells for 400 gp in the immediate vicinity of the Great Rift

and as much as three times that amount farther a eld.

Hammer Pony (CR 1/2): As war pony (MM 277) except +2

Str, 2 Dex, +2 Con, 2 Wis, 2 Cha.

ISLAND PONY

The  Illuskan  people  are  not  known  for  their  horsemanship.

Still, the horse, or more accurately the pony, has played a key

role in their civilization. The island pony seems to be native to

the islands of the Trackless Sea. At 13 hands (4 feet 4 inches)

in height, this large, muscular, and hardy pony has small lively

ears and a barrel chest. Bay, black, and chestnut are the most

common colors; stripes are common on the legs. Its sure-footed

and  strong  hooves  are  made  for  traveling  along  the  broken

ground and usually do not require shoes. These  ne ponies cost

75 gp on the islands of the Trackless Sea, but can cost twice

that amount elsewhere.

Island Pony (CR 1/4): As pony (MM 277) except +2 Str, +2

Con, 2 Cha; +2 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks.

KROMLOR

The Kromlor is a heavy horse used for farming, mining, and

other  heavy  work.  It  is  named  after  the  Kromlor  family  of

Longsaddle, one of the  rst homesteader families to settle the

Savage Frontierif family histories are to be believedwhich

bred them from Nars and the Chionthar. They are popular with

Tethens from Baldurs Gate to points north. The Kromlor is feisty

and always eager to work. This enormous animal is justly famed

for its weight, size, and activity, as well as the long, silky, white

hair that covers its legs from the knees down. The horse stands

18 hands (6 feet) high and weighs up to 2,200 pounds. It has

a  at face and large nostrils. The most common colors for the

Kromlor are bay, black, and brown. Roans are also sometimes

seen. These magni cent animals cost 1,000 gp.

Kromlor (CR 1): As heavy horse (MM 273) except +2 Str,

+2 Con.

LHESPERAN

The Lhesperan is a light horse that originated in the Shaaran

town of Lhesper. It is no longer found there, killed off by the

yuan-ti ages ago, but has spread throughout the Shaar and proven

popular with the marauders of the Bandit Wastes. Lhesperans

are chestnut in color from a golden chestnut to chocolate with

a light colored mane and tail. These elegant and relaxed horses

stand 14 hands (4 feet 8 inches) high. Lhesperans cost 100 gp,

somewhat more than a typical light horse.

Lhesperan (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except speed

70 ft., +2 Con, 2 Wis.

METH

The Meth was bred in northern Unther along the Chessentan

border centuries ago. This light warhorse has a proud heritage

of pulling war chariots throughout the Old Empires of Unther,

Chessenta,  and  to  some  extent  Mulhorand.  This  short-legged

but powerful horse is best known for its strong back and sturdy

disposition. It stands 15-1/2 hands (5 feet 2 inches) high and is

usually solid gray in color, though most solid colors are possible.

These  compact  horses  are  increasingly  popular  in  the  Vilhon

Reach, and cost 450 gp.

NARS

This  breed  of  heavy  horse  has  the  reputation  for  combining

strength, speed, and a placid nature. It is a popular breeding stock

in Almorel, Nathoud, Narfell, Rashemen, Damara, Vaasa, and

Impiltur. The Nars averages 16 hands (5 feet 4 inches) tall at

the withers, making it relatively large for a heavy horse. Its coat

is normally a chestnut color, although golds and blacks are also

found. It is strong in the harness, capable of drawing a sled or a

wagon where normally two horses are required. For its size and

strength, it has a fast gait. The Nars has a good disposition and

is less likely than other breeds to be spooked by sudden shocks.

For these qualities, the Nars is popular with the northern nobility

and yeoman farmers alike. The Nars breed is a staple of the horse

markets of Nathoud, costing 250 gp on average.

RAURIN

This ancient breed of light warhorse has been the wellspring of

many other bloodlines found in the Raurin Desert and surround-

ing lands such as Mulhorand, Murghm, and Semphar. Bred  rst

when the Raurin Desert was a green land, the Raurin has survived

the drastic change to arid desert, growing tough and sturdy. The

Raurin averages 15 hands (5 feet) at the withers with long and

slender legs. Its coat is almost always, golden, dun, or gray in color.

The breed is noted for its strength, stamina, sure-footedness, and

unparalleled speed. The Raurin can survive on fodder alone (not

requiring grain) and can also last three days without water. The

Raurin breed is rare in the desert and virtually unknown in distant

lands where it is seldom recognized. In lands where it is known,

the Raurin breed costs 1,000 gp on average.

Raurin (CR 1): As light warhorse (MM 274) except speed

70 ft., +2 Str, +2 Con.

SEMPHARI

One of the closest relations to the Raurin is the Semphari, a mag-

ni cent breed of light horse. Of the known breeds, none can rival

the Semphari for grace and beauty. These traits, combined with its

 ne stamina, sure-footedness, and intelligent nature, have made it

one of the most valuable of all horses. The Semphari averages 14

hands (4 feet 8 inches) at the withers. Its body is light, its muscles

lean and trim, and its legs long and slender. The coat is almost always

chestnut or white, fading to gray near the rump. The mane and tail

are long. The Semphari is not a widespread breed, found mostly in

Semphar and Murghm. There, the lords and nobles keep breeding

stables and vie to produce the  nest horses. Outside this area, the

Semphari is less well known, although its qualities are easily visible

and thus still fetch a commanding price. Most of the horses are sold

to kings and nobles as breeding stock. The breed costs 2,000 gp on

average, but is almost impossible to  nd outside its homeland.

Semphari (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except +2 Con,

+2 Dex, +2 Cha; +2 racial bonus on Listen checks. The Semphari

grants a +1 bonus on its riders Ride checks. Its DC for learning

tasks is reduced by 2, and it can learn them in half the normal

amount of time.

SHAARAN ZEBRA

The Shaaran Zebra roams wildly throughout the plains of the

Shaar and into the Eastern Shaar. It is a stout light horse that

stands 13 hands (4 feet 4 inches) at the withers and can weigh

up to 630 pounds. It is distinguished from other horses by its

striking pattern of broad, alternating, vertical black and white

stripes. It has a heavy head, stout body, and a short, thick mane.

It has a bark quite unlike the neigh or bray of most equines.

Also, unlike most horses, the Shaaran zebras exhibit a harem-type

social  organization  and  consequently,  are  dif cult  to  separate

from their herd to train effectively.

Shaaran Zebra (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except +2

Con, +2 Wis, 2 Cha. The mount imposes a 2 penalty on Handle

Animal and Ride checks.

SHADIAR

The Shadiar ride and breed small, strong, sure-footed horses from

Calimite and Lhesperan stock, which thrive on nothing more

than the tall grasses of the Lands of the Lion (though many are

spoiled with the occasional carrot, radish, or kohlrabi). These light

warhorses are hardier than normal. They are trained to carry their

riders into battle and are dif cult to spook. These noble beasts of

burden are more than stock to the tribes, however. They are an

integral part of the culture, deeply loved and intertwined with

the nomads history and lore. A Shadiar stands 14 hands (4 feet

8 inches) at the withers. The breed comes in dun, tan, brown, and

black, and many have dappled hindquarters. The Shadiar tribes

rarely sell their exceptional horses to outsiders, but do sell them

to each other for 1,050 gp.

Shadiar (CR 1): As light warhorse (MM 274) except +2 Con,

+2 Wis.

SOSSER

The Sosser is a mix of steppe horse and other breeds favored by

the farmers of the far north. It is commonly found in the lands

of Sossal, Narfell, Vaasa, Damara, and Thar. It is not a glamorous

animal, but it is not as homely as its cousin the steppe horse. The

Sosser is a smallish light horse, about 14 hands (4 feet 8 inches) at

the withers. The Sosser is valued for its sure-footedness, strength,

and ability to resist the cold. Its neck is long and its head narrow.

The hooves are broader than most. The coat is normally chestnut

or copper and grows long during the cold season. The Sosser is

bred to endure the cold weather of the far northern mountains

and to serve as a work animal. It is strong in the harness, capable

of  drawing  a  sled  or  a  wagon  where  normally  two  horses  are

required. The breed costs 90 gp on average.

Sosser (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except +2 Str, +2

Dex, 2 Cha. A Sosser has resistance to cold 5 and receives a +2

resistance bonus on saving throws against cold-based attacks.

STEPPE

This breed of light horse resembles a cross between a horse and

a pony. It is not a graceful or attractive mount, nor is it large

and powerful-looking. However, its homely appearance disguises

an  equine  of  great  endurance  and  strength.  The  Steppe  horse

averages  13  hands  (4  feet  4  inches)  at  the  withers.  It  has  a

short neck, large head, and is heavily boned, making it a small,

ungainly mount. It has a shaggy winter coat of copper or bronze

with a lighter yellow stripe down the back. For all its short legs,

the Steppe horse can go swiftly for long distances. It is strong

and even-natured, making it steady in battle. The steppe horse

survives on grazing alone, not needing separate supplies of grain,

and has great endurance. Still, the steppe horse is not valuable

or widely sought after. The Tuigan tribes of the Endless Waste

and the folk of Rashemen most commonly ride it. Outside of

this region, the Steppe horse is known only in Thesk and does

not command high prices. Only those breeders seeking strength

and stamina for their own bloodlines are likely to consider the

steppe horse worth greater than normal sums. The breed costs

70 gp on average, but is almost impossible to  nd outside the

lands previously mentioned.

Steppe (CR 1): As light horse (MM 273) except +4 natural

armor, +2 Str, 2 Dex, +2 Con, 2 Cha.

THARURR

The Tharurr is a smallish heavy warhorse that is just as likely

to be used as a workhorse. This pure breed was originally found

and used by the ogres of Thar; its name means Thars horse in

the language of giants. In the wake of Thars fall centuries ago,

the breed has become common among the Eraka raiders of the

Ride, the farmers of Damara, and many of the noble warriors

of Impiltur. They are bright, eager to please, and athletic horses,

easily trained and capable of making their way through the broken

ground and mountains of northern Faern. A Tharurr stands

15-1/2 hands (5 feet 2 inches) high and is usually dappled gray

or white. Its sturdy bone structure and powerful hindquarters

characterize it. The creature sells for 800 gp.

Tharurr (CR 2): As heavy warhorse (MM 273) except +2

Dex, +2 Wis, +2 Cha; +2 racial bonus on Climb checks.

UGLIB

This skewbald donkey is of dwarven breeding but is used widely by

the gnomes and even at times by other races. It is hardy and stable,

but ugly in the extreme, with mottled hair that often grows in tufts,

beady eyes, and a stubby tail. The breed also is prone to growing

harmless  but  noticeable  bone  spurs.  Dwarf  and  gnome  miners

use the breed commonly, having built portals to transport stock

wherever they are needed. The Uglib sells for 25 gp among dwarves

and gnomes and for 35 gp to others willing to buy them.

Uglib  (CR  1/3):  As  donkey  (MM  272)  except  +3  natural

armor, +4 Str, +2 Con, 2 Cha; +2 racial bonus on Balance and

Climb checks.

WHITESHIELD

Bred  for  mountainous  and  rocky  terrain,  the  sure-footed

whiteshield  is  a  highly  prized  and  thickly  muscled  war  pony

favored  by  shield  dwarves  across  the  North.  It  has  a  shaggy

cream-colored winter coat that gives way to a somewhat prickly,

dark brown hide in the summer months. The whiteshield is named

for the distinctive shield-shaped patch of pure white hair always

found on the forehead of purebred members of this breed. Many

dwarf warriors tattoo or paint their own shield device onto the

shield-shaped mark before going into battle. This breed stands

12-1/2 hands (4 feet 2 inches) in height and has a large, muscular

frame that can easily support the weight of a fully armored dwarf.

Ponies of this breed cost 200 gp in dwarf clanholds across the

North, but when they are rarely offered for sale to nondwarves,

they can command as much as  ve times that price.

Whiteshield Pony (CR 1/2): As war pony (MM 277) except

+2 Str, +2 Dex, 2 Wis, 2 Cha.

Champions of Valor discusses what it means to be valor-

ous and heroic in Faern. The book introduces heroic

ideals, as well as new feats, prestige classes, and substi-

tution levels for heroes associated with the major valor-

ous organizations. However, it does not provide any

alternate mechanics for heroes belonging to all the

minor valorous organizations in its pages. Some of

these organizations are more suited for player charac-

ters than others, and several seem to cry out for some

player character options. Thus, this web enhancement

offers substitution levels for members of six minor val-

orous organizations.

Champions of Ruin, on the other hand, discusses

what it means to be evil in Faerun, but it offers no sub-

stitution levels for any of the organizations that appear

in its pages. To rectify this apparent oversight, substitu-

tion levels for the Zhentarim fighter and the Dark

Moon monk are provided here as well.

As always, feel free to adapt the material presented

here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.

PREPARATION

You (the DM) need the D&D core rulebooksthe

Players Handbook, the Dungeon Masters Guide, and the

Monster Manualas well as Champions of Valor a n d

Champions of Ruinto use this material. The informa-

tion presented here utilizes the D&D v.3.5 rules.

ORGANIZATION-BASED

SUBSTITUTION LEVELS

To get the benefits of the substitution levels described

here, your character has to join the appropriate organiza-

tion. Membership has its privileges, as someone once said.

All the new class features for the various substitu-

tion levels are described in detail here. The descrip-

tions for any class features that are identical to existing

ones may be found in the appropriate sections of the

Players Handbook.

GOLDEN HANDS OF VERGADAIN

(ROGUE)

The Golden Hands of Vergadain defend the interests of

the dwarves, particularly in areas of commerce and

trade. Furthermore, the members of this organization

work to eliminate threats to dwarven commercial ven-

tures and recover goods stolen from dwarf merchants.

The training provided by the Golden Hands helps

members track foes of the dwarves and deal with them

appropriately.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a Golden Hands substitution level, a character

must be a dwarf, a member of the Golden Hands of

Vergadain, and about to take his 2nd, 3rd, or 6th level

of rogue.

Class Skills

A Golden Hand of Vergadain has the same selection of

class skills as a standard rogue does, plus Survival.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level : 8 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are features of the Golden Hands sub-

stitution levels.

Fa vo red Enemy (Ex ) : A Golden Hand of Ver-

gadain can choose any organization in Faern that

opposes dwarves as a favored enemy, in the same way

that a ranger chooses favored enemies. The Golden

Hand  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  weapon  damage  rolls

against recognized members of the chosen organiza-

tion, and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive,

Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills

against such individuals. This ability cannot be used

to detect members of the chosen organization, and it

applies  only  against  actual  members.  Thus,  the

Golden  Hand  cannot  simply  declare  someone  a

member to gain the bonuses.

This benefit replaces the +1 bonus on Reflex saves

that a standard rogue gains at 2nd level. From this point

forward, the Golden Hands Reflex save modifier is 1

point lower than that of a standard rogue.

Track (@@): A Golden Hand of Vergadain gains

Track as a bonus feat. This benefit replaces the trap

sense class feature that a standard rogue gains at 3rd

level. Any time thereafter that the Golden Hand

would normally gain an increase in the trap sense

ability, he gains a +1 bonus on any check made to

track instead.

Urban Tracking (Ex ) : A Golden Hand of Ver-

gadain can use the Gather Information skill to track

targets in an urban setting. The tracking DCs and

results are the same, but the skill used is different.

This benefit replaces the +1 base attack bonus that a

standard rogue gains at 6th level. From this point

forward, the Golden Hands base attack bonus is 1 point

lower than that of a standard rogue.

HARMONIOUS KNIGHT (PALADIN)

Paladins of the Harmonious Order, called Harmonious

Knights, serve Milil and do good works in his name,

though they tend to be egotistical and overly sure of

themselves. Milil grants paladins of this order musical

abilities to complement their fighting.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a Harmonious Knight substitution level, a char-

acter must have Milil as his patron deity and be about

to take his 1st, 6th, or 9th level of paladin.

Class Skills

A Harmonious Knight adds Perform to the standard

paladins list of class skills.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are features of the Harmonious

Knight substitution levels.

In s p i re Courage (Su ) : A Harmonious Knight

can use songs to inspire courage in his allies and him-

self. As a standard action, he can sing rallying or inspir-

ing war songs that grant all allies that hear him a +1

morale bonus on attack and damage rolls. This effect

lasts as long as the Harmonious Knight sings, and for 5

rounds afterward. This ability is usable once per day per

paladin level, and Harmonious Knight substitution

levels count as paladin levels for this purpose.

This benefit replaces the standard paladins detect evil

ability.

In s p i re Competence (Su): A 6th-level Harmo-

nious Knight with at least 4 ranks in Perform can use

Requirements

To take a Hin Disciple substitution level, a character

must be a halfling member of the Hin Fist order and be

about to take his 1st, 6th, or 9th level of monk.

Class Skills

A Hin Disciple has the same selection of class skills as a

standard monk does.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level : 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are features of the Hin Disciple sub-

stitution levels.

Bonus Fe a t s : At 1st level, a Hin Disciple monk

may choose either Underfoot Combat or Stunning Fist

as a bonus feat, instead of Improved Grapple. At 2nd

level,  he  can  choose  between  Improved  Trip  and

Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat. He need not meet the

prerequisites for these feats. The Hin Disciple does not

gain a bonus feat at 6th level.

Underfoot Combat: You can move into or through a

space occupied by a Large or larger foe without provok-

ing attacks of opportunity. While you are in a square

occupied by a Large or larger creature, you gain a +4

cover bonus to AC against all attacks, even those made

by the creature whose space you occupy.

Blur of Motion (Ex ) : A 6th-level Hin Disciple

with  at  least  5  ranks  in  Tumble  can  use  the  total

defense option and still make a single attack in the

same round. Blur of motion is a full-round action that

can be used only against Large or larger foes.

This benefit replaces the choice of bonus feats that a

standard monk gains at 6th level.

The Ha rder They Fall (Ex ) : A 9th-level Hin Dis-

ciple monk who has taken Improved Trip may grant

allies some of that feats benefit. When the Hin Disciple

trips a foe whose square he occupies, every ally within

melee reach of the downed foe may immediately make

a single attack at its full attack bonus on that opponent.

Each ally also gains the +4 bonus on attack rolls for

attacking a prone foe. This attack is made on the Hin

Disciples turn and does not count against the number

singing to help an ally (but not himself) succeed at a task.

The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear

the Harmonious Knight. The ally gains a +2 competence

bonus on skill checks made with a particular skill as long

as she  continues to  hear the  Harmonious Knights

singing (maximum 2 minutes). Inspire competence is a

mind-affecting ability and is usable once per day.

This benefit replaces the remove disease ability that

the standard paladin gains at 6th level. From this

point onward, the character has one fewer weekly

uses of remove disease than a normal paladin of his

level does.

In s p i re Greatness (Su ) : A 9th-level Harmo-

nious Knight with at least 5 ranks in Perform can sing

to inspire greatness in himself or one chosen ally as a

standard action. The effect lasts for as long as the ally

hears the Harmonious Knight sing and for 5 rounds

thereafter. The affected ally gains 2 bonus Hit Dice

(d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit

points (applying the targets Constitution modifier, if

any, to both extra Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on

attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude

saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for

determining the effect of spells such as s l e e p . I n s p i r e

greatness is a mind-affecting ability and is usable once

per day.

This benefit replaces the second weekly use of

remove disease that the standard paladin gains at 9th

level. From this point  onward, the Harmonious

Knight gains another daily use of inspire greatness

or inspire competence (if he took the 6th Harmo-

nious  Knight  level)  instead  of  each  additional

weekly use of remove disease that he would otherwise

have gained.

HIN DISCIPLE (MONK)

Halfling monks of the Hin Fist are trained to use a foes

size against it. Their fighting style emphasizes bringing

down larger foes and evading their attacks.

gain improved evasion from any class in the future.

SHADOW CLOAK KNIGHT (PALADIN)

For many decades, the gnome paladins belonging to

the Knights of the Shadowy Cloak have worked to

eliminate evil humanoids. To minimize the possibility

of retaliation against gnome communities, they have

developed ways to work in secret.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a Shadow Cloak Knight substitution level, a

character must be a gnome, a member of the Knights of

the Shadowy Cloak, and about to take her 4th, 6th, or

9th level of paladin.

Class Skills

A Shadow Cloak Knight has the same class skills as a

standard paladin does, plus Hide and Move Silently.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level : 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are features of the Shadow Cloak

Knight substitution levels.

Fa vo red  Enemy  ( Ex ) : A  Shadow  Cloak

Knight paladin trains to fight the gnomes tradi-

tional enemies and learns special tactics to defeat

them. She gains humanoids as her favored enemy

type and can choose any of the humanoid subtypes

indicated for rangers on page 47 of the Players Hand-

b o o k . The Shadow Cloak Knight gains a +2 bonus on

weapon damage rolls against her favored enemy and

a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and

Shadow Cloak Knight Substitution Levels

Survival checks when using these skills against crea-

tures of this type.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): A 6th-level Shadow

Cloak Knight can use her Hide skill even when she has

nothing to hide behind, or when she is being observed.

To do so, she must be within 10 feet of any area of shad-

owy illumination in which she could hide, or in the dark.

She cannot hide in her own shadow, and she can hide in

the shadow of a creature only if it is Large or larger. She

cannot use a creatures own shadow to hide from it.

One with the Da rkness (Sp): Once per day, a

Shadow Cloak Knight paladin can become invisible, as

Caster level equals paladin level, and Shadow Cloak

Knight substitution levels count as paladin levels for

this purpose.

HIGH ONE WARRIOR-WIZARD

(WIZARD)

Some paladins of Azuth belong to the Order of the

Swords of the High One. These rare warriors must

progress as paladins before studying wizardry fulltime,

since they cannot multiclass freely. This dual focus

fuses their paladin training with their wizardry.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take a level of High One warrior-wizard, a character

must be a member of the Swords of the High One,

have at least two paladin levels, and be about to take her

2nd, 4th, or 5th level of wizard.

Class Skills

High One warrior-wizards have all the class skills that a

standard wizard does, plus Diplomacy, Handle Animal,

Heal, and Ride.

Class Features

All the following are features of the High One warrior-

wizard substitution levels.

Wi z a rdly Smiting (Su ) : At 2nd level, a High

One warrior-wizard can smite evil as a paladin (see page

44 of the Players Handbook). Her wizard levels stack

with her paladin levels for the purpose of determining

how many times per day she can use this ability.

This benefit replaces the 1st-level spell that a stan-

dard wizard gains at 2nd level. From this point forward,

the character has one fewer 1st-level spells that she can

prepare per day than a standard wizard does.

Reduce Armor Hindrances (Ex ) : The High

One warrior-wizards training in spellcasting allows her

to ignore some of the hindrances of armor. The arcane

spell failure chance imposed by her armor is reduced

by 20% (minimum 0%). Thus, she can wear light armor

without penalty, or medium or heavy armor with

reduced penalties.

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell that a stan-

dard wizard gains at 4th level. From this point forward,

the character has one fewer 2nd-level spells that she

can prepare per day than a standard wizard does.

Familiar Mo u nt : If a High One warrior-wizard

has access to a special mount based on her paladin

levels, this creature gains the characteristics of a famil-

iar as well as those of a paladin mount. The High One

warrior-wizard must dismiss her familiar (if she has

one) to gain this benefit, but she takes no penalties for

doing so. She then uses her wizard level to determine

the natural armor bonus, Intelligence, and special abili-

ties that her familiar should have and applies those to

her special paladin mount. Her High One warrior-

wizard levels count as wizard levels for this purpose.

The mounts  natural  armor bonuses  from  both

sources stack, and it gains the greater of the two Intelli-

gence scores. Thus, the mount has all the abilities of a

special mount appropriate to the characters paladin

level and a familiar appropriate to her wizard level.

Bonuses of the same type do not stack, except as noted

above, and the mount cannot gain the same ability

twice; it takes the better version to which it is entitled.

The High One warrior-wizard does not lose experi-

ence points if the familiar mount is killed because she

can summon a new one according to the rules given for

paladins.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat that a standard

wizard gains at 5th level.

WAYWARD WARDEN (PALADIN)

Wayward Warden paladins dedicate their lives to

defending halfling communities and trade caravans.

Because they use both stealth and honorable confronta-

tion to achieve their goals, paladins in this organization

train in abilities that use the sneakiness of their com-

panions to the groups advantage.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a Wayward Warden substitution level, a charac-

ter must be a halfling, a member of the Wayward War-

dens organization, and about to take her 3rd, 5th, or

10th level of paladin.

Class Skills

A Wayward Warden has the same class skills as a stan-

dard paladin does.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All the following are features of the Wayward Warden

substitution levels.

Distracting Presence (Su): When confronting

evil, a Wayward Warden can focus the attention of her

foes on herself, causing each of them to take a 4

penalty on Spot and Listen checks while she is present.

This benefit replaces the aura of courage class fea-

ture gained by a standard paladin at 3rd level.

Use Your Allies (Ex ) : When a Wayward Warden is

flanking a foe at least one size category larger than her-

self, she deals an extra +1d6 points of damage on every

attack. This extra damage applies even if the foe cannot

be flanked or is immune to flanking, but it does not

apply when the foe is simply denied its Dexterity bonus.

Use your allies is otherwise the same as the rogue sneak

attack ability (see page 50 in the Players Handbook) .

This benefit replaces the second daily use of smite

evil that a standard paladin gains at 5th level. From this

point onward, she has one fewer daily use of smite evil

than a standard paladin does.

Commanding Presence (Su ) : A 10th-level

Wayward Warden can influence the battlefield with

her very presence. Once per day, as a standard action,

she can grant her allies (but not herself) a competence

bonus on attack rolls equal to her Charisma bonus

(maximum +5). Only allies within 60 feet of the Way-

ward Warden that can see and hear her are eligible to

receive this bonus. It lasts for 1 round per paladin

level  that  the  character  possesses,  and  Wayward

Warden substitution levels count as paladin levels for

this purpose.

This benefit replaces the 3rd daily use of the smite

evil ability that a standard paladin gains at 10th level.

From this point forward, she has one fewer daily use of

smite evil than a normal paladin does, or two fewer

uses if she also took the 5th-level Wayward Warden

substitution level.

DARK MOON DISCIPLE (MONK)

The Monks of the Dark Moon are sorcerer-monks who

have dedicated their bodies, minds, and souls to Shar,

the Lady of Loss. Because they deal with shadows and

the  Shadow  Weave,  they  have  developed  special

powers to take advantage of their connection to Shar.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a Dark Moon Disciple substitution level, a char-

acter must be a member of the Monks of the Dark

Moon sect, have Shar as her patron deity, and be about

to take her 3rd, 7th, or 12th level of monk.

Class Skills

A Dark Moon Disciple has the same selection of class

skills as a standard monk does.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level : 4 + Int modifier.

than full daylight, a 7th-level Dark Moon Disciple can

disappear into the shadows, gaining total concealment.

Artificial light does not negate this ability, though a

daylight spell does.

This benefit replaces the wholeness of body class

feature that the standard monk gains at 7th level.

Walk the Sh a d ows (Su ) : At 12th level, a Dark

Moon Disciple can jump from shadow to shadow. This

ability works like the dimension door spell, except that

the Dark Moon Disciple can leave and arrive only in

areas of shadowy illumination. The caster level equals

the characters monk level, and Dark Moon Disciple

substitution levels count as monk levels for this pur-

pose. This ability is usable once per day.

This benefit replaces the abundant step class feature

that a standard monk gains at 12th level.

ZHENTARIM SOLDIER (FIGHTER)

The Zhentarim work across Faerun to bring other

realms under their influence and eventual control. To

that end, Zhentarim Soldiers learn that intimidation is

as effective for coercing the masses as physical force is.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a Zhentarim Soldier substitution level, a char-

acter must be a member of the Zhentarim and about to

take his 3rd, 5th, or 9th level of fighter.

Class Skills

A Zhentarim Soldier fighter has the same selection of

class skills as a standard fighter does, plus Bluff and

Diplomacy.

Skill Po i nts at Each Level : 2 + Int modifier.

Bonus Fe a t : A Zhentarim Soldier gains Skill

Focus (Intimidation) as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

Extended Intimidation (Ex): A target success-

fully intimidated by a 5th-level Zhentarim Soldier suf-

fers  lasting  effects.  Instead  of  ending  when  the

Zhentarim Soldier leaves, as is normal for the Intimi-

date skill, the intimidation effect lasts for 24 hours after

his departure. Thereafter, the targets attitude toward

the Zhentarim Soldier shifts to unfriendly, but a linger-

ing fear remains. Whenever the Zhentarim Soldier

returns to someone he has previously intimidated, he

gains a +4 bonus on his Intimidate check to re-establish

the effect.

Swift Demoralization (Ex): A 9th-level Zhen-

tarim Soldier can use the demoralize opponent aspect

of the Intimidate skill as a swift action rather than as a

standard action.
