Introduction

It doesnt take too much effort to unearth stories, histories,

and legends of the walking dead, those horribly animate mon-

strosities that prey upon the living. From haunted catacombs

to the city necropolis, undead are something every adventurer

is likely to encounter, again and again. In the face of such cer-

tainty, it is best to be prepared

with knowledge of unlife.

Tales  of  the  walking  dead

have entranced and horrified

listeners, readers, and watch-

ers  for  hundreds,  perhaps

thousands  of  years.  Almost

every  culture  on  the  planet

has  its  own  legends  of  rest-

less  spirits,  blood-drinking

fiends, and the animate corps-

es of beloved relatives coming

back  to  haunt  their  unsus-

pecting  relations.  Hundreds

of  books  exist  describing

encounters  with  vampires,

ghosts,  and  ghouls,  and  the

motion  picture  industry  has

contributed an enormous list

of  new  (and  old)  versions  of

these stories.

Libris  Mortis  collects  many

of  those  bits  of  folklore,  lit-

erature,  and  pop  culture  and

presents  them  in  formats  ap-

propriate  for  D&D.  Within

these covers the DM can  nd

new horrors to include in his game, ideas for how to incor-

porate the undead in his campaign world, tips and tricks for

running undead encounters, and a range of sample undead

a new scare to throw at your all-too-complacent players, this

book is what you need.

But the book doesnt leave players out in the cold. Also in-

cluded are optimal tactics for battling the undead, new tools

for  the   ghtincluding  equipment,  magic  items,  spells,

feats,  and  prestige  classesand

even  some  guidelines  for  play-

ing  an  undead  creature  as  a

player character. If roleplaying a

horrible creature damned to eter-

An extra strand of garlic isnt a

bad idea either.

WHAT YOU NEED

TO PLAY

Libris  Mortis  makes  use  of  the

information  in  the  three  D&D

core  rulebooksPlayers  Hand-

book, Dungeon Masters Guide, and

Monster Manual. In addition, it includes references to material

from several D&D supplements, including Monster Manual II,

Fiend Folio, and Book of Vile Darkness. Although possession of

any or all of these supplements will enhance your enjoyment

of this book, they are not strictly necessary.

LIBRIS MORTIS

This book takes its name from a set of tomes penned in a dia-

lect  of  Celestial  by  an  aasimar  cleric  of  Pelor  named  Acrinus,

who collected the information from a variety of other sources

over the course of decades. Roughly translated, it means From

the Books of Dead, though some sages claim that the current

name is a bastardization of Acrinuss original title. Since hes

long dead, and the dialect of Celestial is no longer used by living

creatures, this is impossible to confirm.

The elven tome Maie Firvain (Beyond Death) was one of the

first treatises on the realities of undeath. Most sages find this

work too detached and clinical to be very useful, but it has its

share of supporters.

Not to be outdone by their hated cousins, the drow also pur-

sued this topic. Their most notable contribution, Tsabal Gulstrae

(Weavers of the Dark Void), explored new depths of necroman-

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

tic lore. The book is required reading in most drow academies

of  sorcery,  and  copies  are  on  the  shelves  of  many  dark  elven

clerics as well.

As befits their nature, dwarven scholars took a straightforward

approach to the study of the undead. Thrakharaktor (The Book

of Dark and Restless Souls) contributed many tactics for bat-

tling such creatures, and its lessons have been passed down for

generations among the races of stone.

The most notable human approach to the topic is, of course,

The Book of the Dead (also known as the Necronomicon). Though

this work is perhaps the most well-known of any source material

on the undead, its veracity is frequently questioned by those well

informed on the topic. Some even claim that the book is a crafty

attempt at disinformation, created by some necromancer or lich

to thwart its enemies.

his  chapter  presents  the  truth  about  undeadtheir

origins, habits, physiology, and worldview. Moreover, it

attempts to ascertain the nature of undeath itself, present-

ing several theories concerning the energies that give rise

to unlife.

WHAT IS AN UNDEAD?

What lies at the end of a life well lived? Eons of cold servitude, your

 esh but a memory, your every tortured thought focused on one thing

only: to feed on the living.

Among scholars, debates rage about the multitude of forms,

bodies, powers, and abilities to be found among the undead.

Why are they not all alike? The differences spring from the

source of unlife itself, the dark lan that suffuses the necrotic

tissue of the dead.

MANIFESTATIONS OF UNDEATH

Undeath manifests itself in various ways. One need only  ip

through the pages of a necromancers bestiary to see the mul-

titude of forms and states ascribed to the undead.

One unifying element de nes most undead creatures:

Each must have been alive in the past, no matter how

little  of  the  original  creature  is  left,  even  if  just  the

spirit or memory remains. Although extreme and rare

cases have seen small bits of the energy of unlife itself

(negative energy) take on terrible form and purpose,

almost  all  undead  once  had  breath  in  their  bodies

before gaining their feared title.

ORIGINS OF UNDEATH

Numerous  theories  exist  concerning  the  nature  of

undeath, and though some hypotheses compete with

or contradict one another, others reinforce or overlap

each other. While these conjectures may not agree on

the origins of unlife, most of them at least assert that this

condition is generally visited upon the bodies of recently

deceased creatures. Below are some of the more widely

accepted theories about the origins of this af iction.

space adjacent to the object it haunts. A presence that takes

form can remain so for up to a number of minutes equal to its

HD. An undead that takes form can always choose to return to

its haunting presence status earlier, but it must take a move

action to do so.

While  in  physical  form,  the  undead  can  take  any  actions

normal for an undead of its kind. It can attack, take damage,

and even be destroyed. Unless it is a ghost, lich, or some other

sort of undead that is resistant to destruction, the haunting

presence is also permanently eradicated, though most attempt

to return to their haunting presence status if threatened with

such destruction.

Poltergeist: If  an  object  has  parts  that  move,  such  as  a

wagon, a clock, or a crossbow, a haunting presence can con-

trol the objects movement, though the object will move no

faster than the undead itself could move in its normal form.

Thus, a wagon can be made to steer toward a pedestrian on

a street or roll out of a stable with no horse pulling it. A clock

can slow or run backward. A crossbow can cock and fire (but

not aim or load itself ).

An undead with at least 10 HD and a Charisma score of 17

or higher can actually force an object with no moving parts

to animate (see Animated Objects, page 13 of the Monster

Manual), based on the objects size. No undead, no matter

how many Hit Dice it has or what its Charisma score is, can

animate  an  object  that  has  a  higher  Challenge  Rating  than

its own.

If a location instead of an object is haunted, the haunting

presence can animate a number of objects equal to its HD at

one time.

VARIANT RULE: HAUNTING PRESENCES

Sometimes  when  undead  are  created,  they  come  into  being

without a physical form and are merely presences of malign

evil. Haunting presences can occur either spontaneously (see

Atrocity Calls to Unlife, earlier in this section) or as a result of

the spell haunt shift (see page 66). Tied to particular locations

or objects, these beings may reveal their unquiet natures only

indirectly, at least at first.

As a haunting presence, an undead is impossible to affect

or even directly sense. A haunting presence is more fleeting

than undead that appear as incorporeal ghosts or wraiths, or

even those undead enterprising enough to range the Ethereal

Plane. In fact, a haunting presence is tied to an object or loca-

tion, and only upon the destruction of the object or location

is  it  dispelled.  However,  despite  having  no  physicality,  each

haunting  presence  still  possesses  the  identity  of  a  specific

kind of undead. For instance, one haunting presence may be

similar to a vampire, while another is more like a wraith.

The Haunting: Whenever an undead appears as a haunt-

ing  presence,  it  haunts  an  unattended,  mundane  object  or

location.  Using  the  same  decision-making  process  that  he

uses to populate a location or area with a standard monster,

the  DM  simply  chooses  an  unattended  mundane  object  or

location as the subject of a haunting presence. The DM also

determines the variety of undead (skeleton, zombie, wraith,

or other kind) that serves as the source of the haunting pres-

ence. An undead may haunt a discrete object of at least Tiny

size and no larger than Huge size. Items (both magical and

mundane) currently in the possession of a character (often

referred  to  as  attended  items)  cannot  be  haunted.  Unat-

tended magic items receive a saving throw as if a spell was

being cast upon the item (DC 10 + 1/2 the undeads HD +

the undeads Cha modifier).

A haunting presence becomes a part of the object or loca-

tion haunted. Haunting presences are always aware of what

is going on around the object that they haunt. They can see

and hear up to 60 feet away (but do not gain blindsight). A

haunting presence cannot be turned, rebuked, or destroyed

while the presence remains immaterial (but see Exorcising

a  Haunting  Presence,  below).  Normal  vulnerabilities  of  a

particular kind of undead do not apply to the haunting pres-

ence of that undead. For instance, the haunting presence of

a vampire haunting a fire poker is not destroyed if brought

into sunlight.

Exorcising a Haunting Presence: No matter how a haunting

presence chooses to reveal itself, it is subject to being discov-

ered  and  destroyed.  Unfortunately,  a  clerics  turning  ability

generally  has  no  direct  effect  on  haunting  presences,  other

than  to  irritate  them  and  focus  their  attention  on  the  cleric

doing the turning. Something more is called foran exorcist.

Exorcism is a special ritual, involving a spoken formula calling

upon one or more deities, used with the intention of driving

out haunting presences. Exorcism of a haunting presence is

essentially a two-step processforcing a presence to become

physical, then destroying the revealed undead in the most ex-

peditious manner possible.

First, the forced revelation can be achieved through the use

of  a  special  ritual,  which  is  generally  known  to  anyone  with

ranks in Knowledge (religion). It must be performed by an ex-

orcist who spends ten consecutive full-round actions chanting

or speaking the formula that pertains to exorcism, at the end

of which time the exorcist must make a DC 20 Knowledge (re-

ligion) check. If the exorcists concentration is interrupted, the

ritual must begin again. If the ritual is successful, the haunt-

ing presence becomes physical and must remain so for 1 full

round. The exorcists next action can be used to either attempt

to turn the revealed undead, or to continue the ritual, with an

additional DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check required at the

end of each round. Each successful check forces the undead

to stay corporeal or incorporeal for 1 additional round.

Even undead of 5 or fewer HD that normally haunt only as

poltergeists  are  forced  to  take  form  by  the  exorcism  ritual,

as well as haunting presences that have already used up all

their  chances  to  take  form  for  the  week.  Undead  forced  to

take  form  usually  use  their  actions  to  attempt  to  slay  the

exorcist before they themselves are destroyed, so exorcists

generally bring along companions who can physically attack

the revealed undead.

Effects of a Haunting: A presence haunting an object may

do so in a couple of ways. Undead of fewer than 5 Hit Dice

may use only one form of haunting, but undead of 5 or more

HD can make their presence known using either of the meth-

ods described below (impermanent home or poltergeist). No

matter  the  way  the  haunting  presence  makes  itself  felt,  the

haunting presence of a sentient undead can always choose to

speak to nearby creatures, usually in a whispery or incoherent

voice  that  seems  to  come  from  the  air.  However,  haunting

presences are usually not much for conversation. Characters

may note at times that the object theyve found or the loca-

tion they inhabit has a strange air, or the appearance of it is

somehow off (with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check).

Impermanent  Home:  An  undead  presence  haunting  an

object or an area can sometimes become more than a pres-

ence, actually taking corporeal or incorporeal form a number

of  times  per  week  equal  to  the  undeads  Hit  Dice  (that

includes  haunting  presences  that  manifest  physically  as

incorporeal undead). The presence that takes form does so

anywhere within the location it haunts, or in the closest empty

Atrocity Calls to Unlife: Evil acts can resonate in multiple

dimensions,  opening  cracks  in  reality  and  letting  the  blight

creep in. A suf ciently heinous act may attract the attention of

malicious spirits, bodiless and seeking to house themselves in

 esh, especially recently vacated vessels. Such spirits are often

little more than nodes of unquenchable hunger, wishing only to

feed. These comprise many of the mindless undead. Sometimes

these evil in uences also manage to reinvigorate the decaying

memories of the bodys former host. Thus, some semblance of

the original personality and memories remain, though the newly

awakened being is invariably twisted by the inhabiting spirit,

resulting in an evil, twisted, and intelligent creature. However,

this being is not truly inhabited by the spirit of the original

creature, which has left to seek its ultimate destiny in the Outer

Planes. This amalgamation is something entirely new.

Other times, atrocious deeds call dark, reanimating spirits

into the  eshy form of the newly deceased, leaving the original

spirit  intact.  This  might  happen  if  the  person  was  already

evil, or was tempted to evil in life. Alternatively, some good

spirits  might  be  unnaturally  trapped  within  their  bodies,

slowly being perverted to evil as the dark spirits convert the

body to undead status.

Negative  Energy  as  a  Supportive  Force:  While  atrocity

may serve as a trigger for unlife, it is not enough to bring about

a transformation of this magnitude on its own. It requires the

very  energy  that  drives  dark  spirits  and  their  unquenchable

thirst for life. That which is dead has no vitality, so where does

the energy of animation come from? Negative energya force

that is marshaled, stored, and utilized mostly by evil creatures,

malign deities, and their servantsprovides the power for this

metamorphosis. Just as blood suffuses living creatures, negative

energy suffuses undead, providing them all their abilities, from

mobility to sentience, from  esh-eating to soul-devouring.

Negative Energy as a Draining Force: Some claim that

undead exist concurrently on the Material Plane and the Nega-

tive Energy Plane. More precisely, they believe that undead

on the Material Plane are linked to the Negative Energy Plane

via a conduit, just as life itself somehow partakes of positive

energy.

The  Negative  Energy  Plane  is  the  heart  of  darknessthe

hunger that devours souls. It is a barren, empty place, a void

without end, and a place of vacant, suffocating night. Worse, it

is a needy, greedy plane, sucking the life out of anything vulner-

able to its grasp. Heat,  re, and life itself are all drawn into the

maw of this plane, which perpetually hungers for more.

The very existence of even the weakest undead produces a

constant  drain  on  the  energies  of  the  Material  Plane,  which

accounts for sensations of cold often attributed to the unliving.

As part of the enchantment of their creation, undead siphon

a bit of the energy  owing from the Material Plane toward the

Negative  Energy  Plane.  This  stolen  energy  serves  to  power

their ongoing existence.

More  powerful  undead  have  a  stronger  connection  to  the

Negative Energy Plane and are therefore able to siphon even

more Material Plane energy for their own purposes before it is

forever lost in the Final Void. This type of animation is known

as necromancy, but it could also be called entropic animancy.

Wizards speculate that magic might be able to link objects or

corpses to the Positive Energy Plane, in this case reversing the

 ow of energy.

Undeath as Contagion: Many undead have methods of

propagating their curse among their previously living victims.

For instance, those infected by the diseased bite of a ghoul

may contract ghoul fever. Those who perish from this rotting

illness  rise  at  the  next  midnight  as  ghouls  themselves.  In

this way, some undead recruit the formerly living into their

shuf ing ranks.

Undead propagate in a sick parody of lifes method of mul-

tiplying. Worse yet, undead proliferation is far quicker, easier,

and  doesnt  require  the  consent  of  the  creature  to  be  made

undeadonly a victims inability to drive off the grave-born

attacker.

Purposeful Reanimation: Count on the knowledge-seek-

ers to pursue too far the spark of life, and the dark fruits of

death. Some seek deaths secrets out of fear, thinking that by

overcoming mortality, they will have no more to dread. Mages

who tread this road to its conclusion sometimes embrace death

completely, though they do not become immortal but simply

enduring. Spellcasters who adopt this existence are commonly

known as liches. To their sorrow, most  nd that forsaking all

the pleasures of life while continuing to exist is a fate worse

than the absolution of true death. Others probe the boundaries

between ones last breath and the  nal silence solely for the

sake of knowledge. Shorn of conscience or any passion other

than  the  need  to  know  the  truth,  these  dabblers  have  been

responsible for plagues of zombies, soul-snuf ng winds, and

other atrocities.

Sometimes  these  learned  mages  also  experiment  with

animation  of  inert  matter  that  shares  many  properties  with

the animation of undead, especially when the inert matter in

question is composed of the cast-off body parts of once-living

creatures. Such creations are commonly known as  esh golems.

However, as similar as a  esh golem (or any other construct)

may appear to a zombie, constructs and undead remain sepa-

rate  entities,  for  two  main  reasons.  First,  negative  energy  is

not  a  requisite  power  for  any  common  construct,  including

 esh  golems.  Negative  energy  does  not  energize  constructs,

nor does negative energy play a part in the methods whereby

constructs can af ict foes. Second, constructs are not animated

by evil spirits, but rather by elemental spirits. By some peoples

estimation, this similarity is too close for comfort, but most feel

that the difference is great enough to warrant a clear separation

of type.

UNDEAD PHYSIOLOGY

Necromantic metabolism and faith are indistinguishable. What is

animation of fallow tissue if not faith so pure and undiluted that it

can reach past the grave?

Gulthias, vampiric head of Ashardalons Cult

I know only thisI feed to live, and live to feed.

Redbone, wight assassin

Barring misfortune or their purposeful destruction, undead can

expect to survive in good health for thousands of years, pos-

sibly even a great deal longer. Undead creatures differ from the

living in far more ways than just longevity, however. This section

expands on the undead traits already noted in the description of

the undead type on page 317 of the Monster Manual.

UNDEAD METABOLISM

With  rare  exceptions,  undead  have  little  or  no

metabolism  to  speak  of.  Undead  are  essentially

animated by negative energy, though this anima-

tion  is  sometimes  dependent  upon  the  undeads

ability to feed. Still, while biology plays little part

in the existence of these creatures, the undead do

have some similarities to living beings.

Like ectothermic (cold-blooded) creatures, the

unliving lack the ability to produce their own heat

and must depend on their environment for warmth.

This inability to produce heat is a de ning undead

characteristic, most remarked upon by scholars and

those who encounter them, and often compared to

the chill of the grave. To classify undead as cold-

blooded creatures would be inaccurate, however,

since undead are mostly bloodless. Like ectotherms,

undead take on the temperature of their surround-

ings. However, unlike cold-blooded living creatures,

undead are not unduly harmed by particularly low

temperatures (unless they become frozen solid) or

particularly high temperatures (unless they begin

to smolder and burn).

Diet

Some undead exist for centuries without interact-

ing with any living beings, while others seem to

require, or at least crave with an unstoppable pas-

sion, the  esh, energy, or life force of the still living.

However, even undead that do not need to eat may

have a preferred morsel. Essentially, some undead

can choose to eat if they desire, even if they have

no requirement to consume. They could eat even

ordinary food, if they desired to appear normal or

were interested in trying to tease out some hint of

 avor;  undead  with  tongues,  such  as  ghouls  and

skirrs  (see  page  120)  actually  retain  their  sense

of taste.

Some  undead  glory  in  their  ability  to  feed  off

the living. Others, especially the more intelligent,

romanticize or even eroticize their need to feed on

the living to maintain their strength (or to feed their

addiction). Still, despite the fact that this feeding

ability is often dangerous (or even deadly) to those

who oppose them, the hunger behind it is a major

weakness for many undead.

With all of this in mind, undead feeding require-

ments can be broken into three types: not required,

inescapable craving, and diet dependent.

Not Required: Some undead have no feeding

requirements, existing solely on negative energy.

Inescapable  Craving:  Some  undead  have  no

bodily requirement to feed, and could continue

to exist solely on negative energy, but are driven

to their diet all the same by inescapable cravings.

These cravings, denied too long, could turn even

a  sentient  undead  to  mindless  hunger.  Once  the

feeding is accomplished and the hunger sated, the

intensity of the craving drops back to a tolerable

level, but it is a cycle doomed to repeat itself.

If a player controls an undead with an inescapable craving, use

the Variant Rule: Handling Undead Hunger sidebar on page 10.

Diet Dependent: Some undead must feed on the living to

retain either their mobility or some of their other abilities. The

link to the Negative Energy Plane for undead of these sort grows

increasingly tenuous the longer they are denied the necessary

food.  At  some  point,  their  mobility  or  one  or  more  speci c

abilities  are  suppressed  until  they  can  feed  again.  However,

no matter how enervated by lack of feeding, undead cannot be

starved to the point of permanent deanimation. A fresh infusion

of their preferred food can always bring them back to their full

abilities. Most diet-dependent undead can go for 3d6 months

before losing all mobility.

If a player controls an undead with a diet-dependent exis-

tence, use the Variant Rule: Handling Undead Hunger sidebar

on this page.

Undead Hunger: Undead that have an inescapable craving

do not have the option to not feed; their hellish hunger cannot

be  denied.  Likewise,  diet-dependent  undead  know  that  they

require sustenance as well. Mindless undead do not care if their

hunger drives them into the open or into tactically questionable

attacks, but intelligent undead prefer to direct their own actions.

However, if an intelligent undead is too long denied that which

it desires most, its actions may soon drive it into a frenzy, despite

its desire to remain hidden or anonymous. Similarly, those that

depend on a steady diet to supplement their existence will take

steps to see that their ability to feed is not compromised. The

DM determines when insatiable hunger may play a role in an

undead monsters or NPCs motivation.

Undead Healing

manently destroyed.) No aid, magical or mundane, is suf cient

to restore the undead to its previous state of animation.

Since they are already dead, undead that are destroyed cannot

be returned to existence through raise dead or reincarnate. Resur-

rection and true resurrection can affected undead, but these spells

turn undead back into the living creatures they were before they

became undead.

Only  undead  with  Intelligence  scores  can  recover  lost  hit

points,  usually  through  necromantic  healing  (see  below)  or

through the application of negative energy. An undead with

the fast healing ability does not require an Intelligence score

to bene t from that ability.

Necromantic Healing: With 8 or more consecutive hours

of inactivity in any 24-hour period, an undead with an Intel-

ligence score recovers 1 hit point per Hit Die. If such an undead

is completely inactive for a full 24-hour period, it recovers 2 hit

points per Hit Die.

Magical Healing: The application of negative energy, such

as an in ict spell, can restore hit points to an undead. Generally,

any spell that would harm a living creature by the application of

negative energy heals the same number of lost hit points when

cast on an undead.

Healing  Ability  Damage:  Ability  damage  is  temporary,

just as is hit point damage. Ability damage returns at the rate

of 1 point per 24 hours (although ability damage taken through

failure to satiate an undeads inescapable craving to feed or to

satisfy an undeads diet dependence does not heal naturally in

this manner).

Necrotic Reserve: Some undead that have the ability to feed

on the living can use this ability to invigorate their bodies on a

daily basis, granting them some small reprieve from immediate

destruction when they take damage. See the Necrotic Reserve

feat, page 28, for more details.

A living creature that is lethally hurt may become disabled or

dying. During this time, aid or good luck can return the creature

back to health and eventually full strength. Undead are not so

fortunate. What would disable or render unconscious a living

creature destroys an undead creature beyond recall. (In game

terms, when an undead is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is per-

Undead do not sleep, and they almost never require rest (though

some may receive healing bene ts from rest, as outlined above).

VARIANT RULE: HANDLING UNDEAD HUNGER

This variant rule is best applied to undead player characters that

are  diet  dependent  or  have  inescapable  cravings.  These  rules

work less well for undead that spend years or more locked away

in tombs before getting a chance to feed. However, the DM may

decide  to  use  these  rules  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for  NPC  or

monster undead as well.

The hunger felt by an undead with the need for sustenance is

akin to an addiction. Like living creatures with an extreme crav-

ing for some chemical substance, hungry undead are prone to

erratic, violent, and sometimes self-destructive behavior if they

are denied their preferred morsels.

the table. After the satiation period wears off, the undead once

again grows hungry.

Damage: An  undeads  need  to  feed  is  like  a  mental  spike

boring into its awareness, dealing the indicated damage each

day unless the undead succeeds on the saving throw or feeds.

An undead immediately gains back all of the ability damage it

has taken if it manages to feed.

As the undead goes longer and longer without feeding, poten-

tially losing Wisdom all the while, the undead grows increasingly

unbalanced.  It  mulls  over  plans  that  would  allow  it  to  feed

plans it would likely consider too risky were it completely sane.

When the undead reaches 0 Wisdom, it retains no volition of its

own, no judgment to deter it from seeking its preferred morsel,

even if the undeads utter destruction seems likely thereafter. (A

player character who reaches 0 Wisdom from a failure to feed

is temporarily remanded to the DM, who plays the undead as a

ravening beast until the character has fed.)

An  intelligent  undead  sometimes  plans  for  this  eventuality,

even arranging to have itself locked away in a self-constructed

vault from which it is unable to escape. It will stay there until a

prearranged third party provides the undead with its preferred

morsel  (presumably  in  a  fashion  that  does  not  endanger  the

third party, though accidents do happen).

Satiation: An undead with an inescapable craving takes abil-

ity  damage  each  day  unless  it  makes  a  successful  DC  25  Will

save. A diet-dependent undead takes ability damage every three

days unless it makes a successful DC 15 Will save. Each time

an undead feeds on its preferred morsel, it is satiated and need

not make these saving throws for the satiation period noted on

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

However, undead that cast spells require some time to refresh

their consciousness, just as living spellcasters do, before they

can prepare or cast new spells.

To regain the ability to cast or prepare daily spells, an undead

must have a clear mind. To clear its mind, the undead must

experience 8 hours of restful calmit must refrain from move-

ment, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other

demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If

the restful calm is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour

to the total amount of time the undead has to rest in order to

clear its mind.

UNDEAD PROPAGATION

Many undead share at least one characteristic with living crea-

turesthey possess the means to propagate their own kind.

Several varieties of undead can cause their slain victims to rise

from the grave, thereby creating new unliving creatures.

Creating Undead Spawn: Many undead have the ability to

create spawn (an equal or lesser version of themselves, but under

their control) simply by slaying their victims. Presumably, the

undead must have drained at least one of the victims ability

scores or bestowed at least one negative level for this death to

occur. (For instance, a wight that pushes a gravestone over on an

enemy, killing it, shouldnt expect to gain a new wight servant

from the victims remains.)

Taking a broader view, undead propagation might be regarded

as an infectious disease: It is nasty, it is easily spread, and it kills

its hosts. Of course, the plague of self-propagating undead is

far worse than any common disease (especially since normal

methods for preserving oneself against disease are useless in

this case), but the cure is little differenteliminate the source

of infection, and you eliminate the malady itself.

The unliving make use of several different methods to create

new undead creatures. These methods, and the creatures that

employ them, are summarized in Table 12.

VARIANT RULE: FORGOING SPAWN CREATION

In  cases  where  stealth  or  obfuscation  of  their  presence  is

necessary, some undead may choose to not create spawn. Any

undead that has the ability to create spawn (even those that

normally do so automatically) can choose to forgo that creation

with a little effort. Each time it is capable of spawning a new

creature, an undead can prevent the spawn from coming into

existence by making a DC 15 Intelligence check.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

protects the body against rising as a spawn should the unthink-

able happen, and the believer fall in battle against undead. (See

the spawn screen spell, page 71, for more details.)

UNDEAD DEVELOPMENT

Unlike living creatures, which grow and mature throughout

their life cycles, undead are usually changeless, frozen in the

moment of their creation. Most are cursed to never adopt new

philosophies, or change with the uncertainties and lessons of

life, or ever  nd happiness.

An undead that persists for century after century sometimes

 nds ways to grow in strength and knowledge. Its connection

to  the  Negative  Energy  Plane,  originally  a  mere  trickle,  can

become  an  actual  current  over  hundreds  of  years,  and  given

enough time, a mighty stream.

Gaining Class Levels: Intelligent undead have the option

of receiving training and gaining levels in an NPC or PC class.

Not all intelligent undead have the mental aptitude necessary for

some of the more intellectual endeavors, so less cerebral classes,

such as barbarian and  ghter, often prove popular among them.

Particularly intelligent undead are usually drawn to spellcasting

classes. Undead that started as high-level spellcasters and used

magic to bridge the gulf separating them from mortality may

continue to add spellcasting classes normally.

Evolution:  Sometimes  undead  just  become  stronger

through time. This seasoning of ability takes hundreds of years

of existence, and even then, of those undead that persevere for

so long, only a handful grow more powerful. This maturity

of  power  is  dependent  on  the  undeads  tie  to  the  Negative

Energy Plane. As the creatures existence stretches through

the centuries, its connection to this void energy slowly grows

more secure, imbuing the monster with strength, vigor, and

dark purpose. (See the evolved undead template, page 99, for

more details.)

UNDEAD SENSES

As with other predatory creatures, undead have senses suf cient

to reveal their prey, and in some cases, these senses are even

enhanced.

Vision (Ex): The energy that animates an undead extends to

its organs of sight, giving all undead creatures darkvision out to

at least 60 feet. They are never hindered by darkness, and they

are able to see even in pitch black conditions, when most living

creatures are unable to discern the least visual clue.

Scent and Hearing (Ex): The energy that animates an undead

extends to the organs of scent and hearing as well. Thus, undead

can smell and hear just as living beings do. As with sight, how-

ever, if an undead physically loses a particular organ, it can no

longer use that particular ability.

Taste  (Ex):  The  energy  of  animation  also  extends  to  an

undeads  organs  of  taste.  However,  if  an  undead  physically

loses its tongue, it can no longer detect its environment in this

fashion. Many undead fall into this category, including skeletons.

All incorporeal undead lose the ability to taste (but they can still

hear and smell).

Touch: Undead retain a blunt, phantom sense of touch, more

mechanical than biological. It is a pale, crude approximation of a

real tactile sense. Incorporeal undead have no sense of touch.

Lifesense:  Some  undead,  especially  those  without  the

customary organs that grant the ability to sense their environ-

ment, sense the world as a great darkness illuminated only by

the light given off by living creatures. To such an undead, each

living creature gives off light in a 20-foot radius, illuminating

all objects within that radius. (See the Lifesense feat, page 28,

for more details.)

UNDEAD OUTLOOK

AND PSYCHOLOGY

Death does determine life. . . . Once life is  nished it acquires a sense;

up to that point it makes no sense; its sense is suspended and therefore

ambiguous.

Pier Paolo Pasolini

Death borders upon our birth, and our cradle stands in the grave.

Joseph Hall

Like  people,  no  two  undead  have  exactly  the  same  outlook.

However, among a population that is composed of stale  esh,

skeletal  shells,  or  insubstantial  shadows  of  ill  will,  certain

similarities emerge.

The living spend their time living life and gathering expe-

rience, thereby shaping their personalities and adjusting to

the world as it changes around them. In contrast, the undead

mind sees the passage of time very differently. Undead exist,

they do not live. Life means change, and while undead endure

over time and learn new facts, they rarely change or appreciate

new paradigms. Aside from a rare few exceptions, an undeads

outlook remains stagnant over the decades, or centuries, of

its existence, despite new experiences and new situations it

may encounter.

This in exible mental nature is the reason many ancient

undead seem insane. In fact, they may merely be operating

with goals and aspirations that are slightly out of step with the

present world. Unfortunately, like any ambition that cannot

be swayed by reason or tempered by changing circumstances,

the goals of the stubborn immortal undead become a canker-

ous  evil  that  can  only  be  excised.  While  a  living  creature

may accept compromise when life hands it a new challenge,

undead  can  rarely  do  anything  other  than  what  they  have

always done.

The ability to think is a quality the vast bulk of undead do not

possess. Mindless undead merely respond to preset commands

or stimuli, driven by nothing other than the energy that ani-

mates them. These undead have no outlook; they are robbed

of thought. They are nearly mechanical in their actions, and

often those actions are as easy to anticipate as the revolution

of a water wheel.

On the other hand, sometimes mindless undead are agents of an

intelligent master, whether undead or merely malign. Thus, even

mindless undead may prove to be surprising foes, if their positions

and responses to a given situation are properly coordinated and

prepared. Only sentient undead have the luxury of possessing an

outlook and a comprehensible psychological state.

TIME AND IMMORTALITY

Compassion is a choice. When someone is perceived as com-

passionate, that person has made a series of choices. Mindless

undead are already out of the running when it comes to making

choices, but what about sentient undead and compassion?

Plainly, the choice to be compassionate is not something

most  intelligent  undead  consider.  In  many  cases,  the  event

that  animated  a  particular  undead  is  such  a  transformative

experience that it imprints the new undead in its image. And in

almost every case, that event is generated from an evil impulse

or action.

But  is  something  truly  evil  if  it  doesnt  consider  the  con-

sequences  of  its  actions?  Yes,  of  course,  but  consider  evil  for

evils  sakethe  ability  to  recognize  that  actions  taken  will

cause horror, ruin, and death, but to take those actions anyway.

Most intelligent undead retain enough memory of their former

lives to know that their acts are horrendous. Some may even

feel pangs of guilt, even going so far as to capriciously allow

surviving victims to go free. This act becomes more likely if the

undead is a feeder that has recently fed on its preferred morsel.

However, when the hunger mounts again, as it must, the undead

may curse its generosity, again seeking out those it previously

allowed to escape.

Those  creatures  fanatical  enough  to  actually  seek  undeath

strive to escape the bonds of mortality and thereby gain a term

of existence far beyond their natural life spans. Such mortals

often presume that this gift of extended time comes without

a price. They hope that by having no temporal limits on their

life spans, they will be able to accomplish all of their dreams

and visions.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

VARIANT RULE: INFLUENCING UNDEAD

Victims may attempt to play upon the sympathy of certain in-

telligent undead, seeking leniency or freedom. If the would-be

victim can verbally demonstrate some kinship with the undead

assailant  (recalling  to  the  undead  that  it  once  breathed,  was

once  also  human,  also  had  children  at  home,  or  demonstrat-

ing some other, more direct relationship), the victim gains a +4

circumstance bonus to influence the undead with a Diplomacy

check. Most undead begin with a hostile attitude, but if a victim

can  change  the  attitude  to  indifferent  or  better,  that  undead

may allow the victim and friends to go free, at the DMs option.

However, this grace period lasts only 10d10 minutes, after which

the undead has a change of heart, regrets its leniency, and again

seeks out its former prisoners. At this point, no further play on

its sympathy is possible.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

VARIANT RULE: UNDEAD DENSITY

When too many undead are spawned (or gather on their own

initiative), the concentration of undead within a given area rises.

As the density increases, the influence of so many creatures suf-

fused with negative energy can have real effects.

Undead density is expressed in terms of the total Hit Dice of

undead  in  a  100-foot-radius  sphere  (regardless  of  intervening

walls or other barriers). If the total Hit Dice of undead in this

area rises to 1,000 or higher, the saturation of negative energy

effectively grants all undead in the area +4 turn resistance.

An even higher undead density could grant greater turn resis-

tance, but such density would be difficult to achieve due to space

requirements and crowding.

12

For  other  undead  with  the  ability  to  feel,  it  is  an  easier

burden to bear if they mentally detach themselves from their

former lives. These undead cannot feel empathy for would-be

victims because they no longer feel a kinship. To these undead,

the living are now the prey, and the undead the predators. Just as

wolves take down weak and old herd beasts, so too can undead

prey upon the living, simply ful lling their role in the natural

order of life.

SPAWN

Many  undead  have  the  ability  to  create  spawn  (see  Undead

Propagation, above), but undead take a very different approach

to their children than mortals do. Although exceptions exist

(such as the necropolitans, which are created willingly by other

undead in a grisly and painful ceremony, as described on page

115), most undead tend to fall within the general parameters

described below.

Reasons

Undead of low intelligence (such as shadows) that have the abil-

ity to create spawn do so almost by accident. They do not create

spawn for any higher purpose but as a consequence of the curse

that gives them life. Sometimes undead of low intelligence even

come to regard the spawn they have created as competitors for

the same living resources, resulting in con ict.

Undead with more intelligence (such as wraiths and vampires)

usually  create  spawn  only  when  it  serves  their  goals.  Unfor-

tunately for the living victims, it is often in the undeads best

interest to create spawn. After all, not only does it eliminate a

potential adversary, but it creates a willing ally in the process.

Control

Once  undead  have  created  their  spawn,  they  may  command

these  children  as  they  see   t.  Their  power  over  the  spawn

they have created remains in effect until their death, at which

time all their spawn become free. Spawn in turn have the same

capacity to create children in their own image, and they may

command those children as they are in turn commanded by

their creator.

It  is  not  uncommon  for  great  webs  of  control  to  exist  in

undead  hierarchies,  reaching  back  to  the  oldest,  longest  sur-

viving undead that initiated the chain. Ultimately, the heads

of these undead webs may wield great power if they guide their

ever-growing family in ways that maximize their strength and

minimize  their  exposure  to  being  found  and  eliminated  by

zealous undead hunters.

Usually, even creatures of limited free will come to resent

being under the control of another, but this is not true

of undead spawn. The act of their creation

generates a bond of service and even affec-

tion for their creators. While this command

can be brie y undermined through a clerics

turning or rebuking ability, undead always

return  to  the  service  of  their  creators

if possible.

Affection

Calling  any  portion  of  the  bond

between spawn and creator affec-

tion may be going too far, but spawn

are de nitely slavish in their attention

to every detail of their creators wishes. Spawn never hesitate to

take any action commanded by their creators, even if that action

leads to certain destruction.

However, this affection doesnt necessarily run both ways.

For the most part, spawn creators care little for the fate of those

they have created, except so far as it serves a larger plan or gen-

erates a body of useful servants. Intelligent undead view their

spawn in much the same manner as they view the mindless

undead in their employexpendable.

Some  undead  that  retain  corporeal  bodes  and  can  create

spawn (most notably vampires) retain a strong tie to the asso-

ciations of their life. As such, they may continue to nurture real

affection for individuals still living. Tortured by the thought

of losing contact with a friend or loved one, the undead may

seek out that individual and, out of love, may attempt to turn

its beloved into a spawn. If the attempt is successful, the loved

one joins the ranks of the undead, but the bond between the

two of them is now arti cially enforced by the nature of the

creation. The loved one now exists in a horrible position of

compulsory affection.

Because undead can be made of any living creature, they gener-

ally have no overall culture or single form of society. However,

undead  can  still  be  de ned  in  how  they  interact  with  other

established  societies  around  them.  Additionally,  while  most

undead prefer to exist on the fringes of real society, some undead

are more cultured and re ned in their sensibilities.

No Society: Many undead have no society. They are animated

through chance or malign power, they lurk for years in or near

a grave, and if they need to feed, they scrabble and claw their

way to their desired food as best they can. They continue this

pattern ceaselessly until they are  nally destroyed. Mindless

undead make up the bulk of these societyless undead, but any

undead, no matter its intelligence, can fall into this basic preda-

tory existence.

In  ltrators:  Undead  with  magical  powers  suf cient  to

disguise  their  lifeless  nature  sometimes  choose  to  partake

in the society of the living. Undead that can naturally appear

alive also commonly employ this trick, particularly vampires.

In this way, some undead never really leave the society from

which they sprang, though their habits must change to support

this masquerade.

Undead may choose to retain their ties to living society for

several different reasons. For instance, some undead feel that

without the contacts and entertainments they enjoyed as living

creatures, they would eventually become insane. Additionally,

the in ltration of living society also provides some undead with

a constantly renewing pool of potential victims. This scenario

has been played out so many times (particularly with vampires)

that it needs little further elaboration.

Finally,  intelligent  undead  may  have  other  requirements

beyond simple nourishment or surcease from loneliness. Liches,

in particular, enter their unliving state to prevent disturbing

their  research  by  anything  so  mundane  as  mortality.  While

many liches are content to entomb themselves for eons of private

study, other liches understand the value of collaboration and

desire access to the latest magical theories and research. These

cosmopolitan undead may maintain the charade of life simply

to ensure their continued access to such resources as magical

academies,  memberships  in  spellcaster  guilds,  and  access  to

libraries of lore.

Open  Members:  In  some  extraordinary  settings,  undead

need not even hide their status, but may become open members

of society. Where, you might ask, can undead openly walk the

streets without be shunned and hunted? Probably not anywhere

on the Material Plane, but some extraplanar cities are cosmo-

politan  enough  to  grant  limited  citizenship  even  to  undead,

presuming that those undead follow all the rules of polite society.

The rules of such societies generally include,  rst and foremost,

no predation on other members of that society. On the Outer

Planes, Sigil (also called the City of Doors) is the most renowned

of such tolerant locations.

Even in such open-minded cities, undead must often submit

to a process of authorization in order to have unrestricted legal

access to the metropolis. An undead with recognized feeding

requirements (notably vampires, but also other undead) must

obtain an authorization for a given length of time (which varies

by locale or even precinct, but usually must be renewed at least

once a year). This authorization requires the undead to show, in

detail, how it will meet its feeding needs for the given period

in a way that does not involve harm to other citizens, visitors

to the locale, or citizens of other locations that could  nd fault

with the citys harboring the undead in question. Most such

plans revolve around the purchase of livestock from which the

undead obtains sustenance.

Living citizens are usually presumed innocent of predation

until  proven  otherwise,  but  for  undead,  whose  natures  are

often impossible to suppress, the presumption goes the other

way. Undead that are openly part of societies that tolerate them

must go a step farther than the average citizen to maintain their

civilized nationality. They must be very careful not to break any

rules or overstep any boundaries, or their citizenship may not

be the only thing revoked.

Undead Society: In some places, the roles of living and dead

in society are turned upside down. Undead are a part of society

to such an extent that they are completely integrated. Undead

merchants sell their wares in the shadowed end of the market

bazaar,  undead  councilors  hold  positions  of  authority,  and

undead adventurers seek gold and glory alongside (or instead

of) living thrill-seekers.

In other places, undeath is the dominant aspect of society.

Only  the  dead  partake  of  the  societys  bene ts,  and  all  the

needs of the society are addressed. Farms on the outskirts of

large  cities  do  not  grow  grains,  but  instead  produce  living

creatures (often humanoids) that feed the undead masses that

require life essence, blood, or  esh for sustenance. Unless a

would-be member of this society is already undead, becoming

a member requires the creature to undergo the transformation

into unlife.

For example, in a ward of the city called Nocturnus, undead

rule. While living citizens from other parts of the city can enter

the ward and conduct their business, only undead can claim

residence  in  the  ward,  and  therefore  gain  the  dark  bene ts

provided to ward residents. The living can petition to take up

residence in the undead ward, called the Pale, but they must

submit to a supremely painful process called crucimigration,

which transforms them into deathless, but intelligent, versions

of their former selves. (See the necropolitan description, page

115, for more details about this transformation.)

UNDEAD RELIGION

Do you question your life? Do you wonder what use is this day-to-day

existence each of us endures? Have your youthful dreams been trampled

by necessity, and are those dreams now forever beyond your grasp? Do

you labor each day just to get by, get through, only to wake again on

the morrow to repeat another plodding day, a hollow husk of what

you had hoped to be and do? Do you desire to blunt the harsh, banal

life you live? Do you despair? Then come  nd us. The Church of the

Reaper has the answer.

Pamphlet seeking converts to

Nerulls fold under false pretenses

The undead revere many different deities, though newly con-

verted undead are often entirely ignorant of those deities now

most deserving of their service. As noted in the previous section,

undead often partake of no uni ed culture. However, like calls

to like, and no unifying force is more potent than the divine

call of undead gods to their potential  ocks.

Creatures  other  than  undead  can  worship  the  deities

described here. These gods are always happy to have living, if

evil, adherents. In time, these followers too may become undead.

Such worship is particularly common among certain cults and

depraved races, as outlined below.

DEITY DESCRIPTIONS

Each of the deity descriptions that follow contains the categories

of  information  explained  below.  (Game  statistics  and  divine

powers for the deities are beyond the scope of this book).

Name: The  rst line of a deity description gives the name

by which the deity is generally known. Other names or titles

attributed to the deity (if any) are given immediately beneath

this name.

Divine Rank/Alignment: The next line gives the deitys

relative  level  of  power  compared  to  that  of  other  deities.  In

descending order, the levels of power (as described in Deities

and Demigods) are greater deity, intermediate deity, lesser deity,

and demigod. This ranking does not affect the abilities of clerics

of  a  deity,  the  power  of  the  spells  those  clerics  cast,  or  most

anything else in the mortal world. Immediately following this

is the deitys alignment. Deities have the same alignments as

mortals do (see Alignment, page 103 of the Players Handbook).

Description: Next is a brief description of what the deity

faith.

Rites: This section outlines and illustrates some of the rites

that the deity may require from its followers and clergy.

Herald and Allies: A deitys herald is the kind of creature it

often sends to the Material Plane when it needs to intervene

in mortal affairs. A deitys allies are the creatures it sends in

response to lesser planar ally, planar ally, and greater planar ally

spells, respectively.

Holy symbol

Favored Weapon: This entry gives

the kind of weapon the deity favors.

The deitys clerics prefer to use this weapon,

and certain spells that clerics cast, such as

spiritual  weapon,  may  have  effects  that

resemble this weapon.

AFFLUX

Bloodfather,  the  Unsatis ed  Questioner,  the

Bloodspiller

Lesser Deity (Neutral Evil)

The unquenchable Af ux seeks knowledge of blood,

body, and mind. Af ux never  inches from sacri cing the

living to understand what made them once alive. He is the

lord of interrogation, torture, and execution, as well as the

knowledge  gained  thereby.  He  appears  as  a  hairless,  blood-

soaked  man  of  pale   esh  and  supernaturally  bloodshot  eyes.

He wears a great coat of blood that constantly drips and  ows

but never runs dry. His home plane is Carceri, and his symbol

is a scarlet droplet.

Necromancers, evil wizards, inquisitors, and torturers revere

Af ux.  All  followers  of  Af ux  see  members  of  good-aligned

faiths, especially those that claim to offer knowl-

edge, as their enemies. Among the evil

deities, Af ux has no special foes, and his

followers may sometimes enter alliances

of convenience with other evil churches

when their goals intersect.

Af ux teaches that every creature

has a secret, no matter how mundane,

and  the  best  way  to  spill  that

secret is along with the creatures

blood.  To  search  eternally  for

knowledge  is  a  noble  quest,  but

the best place to search is in the

tissues  of  the  living,  dead,  and

undead, since the secrets of sentience

and  animation  mask  the  real  secret  of

ultimate understanding.

Portfolio: Inquiry, necromancy, death.

Domains: Knowledge, Evil, Deathbound, Undeath.

Holy symbol of Doresain

Cleric Training: Sometimes evil wizards come to at least

revere,  if  not  worship,  Af ux.  Certainly  his  name  is  known

among necromancers, whose grisly researches are so similar

to Af uxs prescribed methods. Torturers and others who delight

in the physical pain visited on others pay the Unsatis ed Ques-

tioner frequent homage.

Quests: The clerics of Af ux disseminate to lands near and

far, teaching their twisted lore of pain and torture to all that

will listen.

16

Prayers: The prayers offered up to Af ux resemble the sounds

of the victims put on the rack by the gods ordained torturers.

Each scream is a mantra, and a night of pain is a solemn mass.

Temples:  Af ux  has  few  temples.  Any  necromancers  lab

where the methods of the Bloodspiller are utilized can become

a shrine to Af ux if the space is hallowed in his name.

Rites: When a victim succumbs too quickly to pain, it is cus-

tomary for the presiding cleric to wound himself in Af uxs

name (if the cleric is living), to offer some additional pain

as recompense.

Herald  and  Allies:  Af ux  generally  sends  a

wheep  (see  page  132)  as  a  herald.  His  planar

allies are ravids, night hags, and nightwings.

Favored Weapon: Short sword.

DORESAIN

King of the Ghouls

Demigod (Chaotic Evil)

The  insatiably  hungry  Doresain  appeals  to  all

creatures whose hunger can never be appeased. The

deity looks like an especially thin and wasted ghoul. He

has eyes ablaze with a sickly green ghoul-light, and his feet are

hoo ike. In contrast with Doresains wasted body, he wears an

elegant white cloak of supple man- esh over pale leather armor

studded with tiny skulls. Ghouls are the primary worshipers of

Doresain, and his symbol is a ghoul skull.

Though the King of the Ghouls is a powerful entity himself

and controls his own layer of the Abyss, he was once a vassal of

Orcus. Later, Yeenoghus gnoll host invaded, and the King of the

Ghouls was forced to swear fealty and pay homage to Yeenoghu.

Yeenoghu subsequently lost control of the Kings layer, and more

recently, Yeenoghu has lost the ability to command

the King.

The King of the Ghouls teaches that to

exist is to eat. A fully experienced existence

requires the consumption of prey, preferable

sentient. Flesh for sacri ce is dear to

the King. When life is quenched under

tearing teeth and quivering lips, the

eater can  nally feel true happiness,

at least for a time.

Portfolio: Necromancy, ghouls.

Domains: Chaos, Evil, Hunger.

Cleric  Training:  Doresain

sometimes  makes  an  appearance

when  incautious  necromancers  med-

dle with the Negative Energy Plane. Taking

such  meddling  as  an  invitation,  the  King  ap-

pears  and  forcibly  converts  all  those  present  to

ghouls,  often  thereby  creating  new  worshipers  for  himself.

While many ghouls are ignorant and godless, those that  nd

religion invariably discover the King of the Ghouls. Creatures

other than ghouls that come to worship the King do so with

the knowledge that they will be drawn into the fold sooner

rather than later.

Quests: All ghouls pay homage to the King. Ghoul lore hear-

kens back to a land sacred to ghouls called the White Kingdom.

Though  ghouls  bound  to  the  mortal  plane  sometimes  create

lesser versions of what they believe the White Kingdom to be,

it is accepted that the true incarnation of the White Kingdom

can be found on the layer of the Abyss where the King rules.

Prayers: Each gluttonous act of consumption is, in its way, a

prayer to Doresain, even if the eater doesnt know it.

Temples:  Temples  to  the  King  of  the  Ghouls  are  found

only  underground.  Small  shrines  can  sometimes  be  found

in underground mausoleums or at the catacombs center,

but  fully  functioning  temples  are  erected  only  in  the

deepest subterranean realms, surrounded by

a community of ghouls the size of a small

city (at least).

Rites:  Sharing  the  sweet   esh  of  a

victim  among  several  ghouls  is  infor-

mally  called  passing  it  around  the

horn,  and  serves  as  a  common  rite

in remembrance of Doresain.

Herald  and  Allies:  Doresain

often  sends  a  gravetouched  ghoul

13th-level barbarian as his herald. His

planar allies are gravetouched ghoul

succubus  demons,  gravetouched  ghoul

erinyes devils, and gravetouched ghoul

ice devils. Doresain has the power to add

the gravetouched ghoul template (see page

103) to creatures to which the template

is normally not applicable.

Favored Weapon: Scimitar.

EVENING GLORY

The Deathless Beauty, the Eternal Lover

Lesser Deity (Neutral)

Holy symbol of

Evening Glory

Evening Glory teaches that love need not ever die. Instead,

love may go on inde nitely, if the bodys remains are properly

preserved. The deity of love at any price, Evening Glory

appears  as  an  exquisitely  preserved  woman  with

ice-white (almost translucent)  esh and platinum-

white, neck-length hair. She has eyes of baby blue,

with  lips,   ngernails,  and  toenails  the  same

color. She is  awless, despite (or because of)

her necrotic chill. Disdaining simple nudity,

the  Deathless  Beauty  prefers  extravagant,

backless gowns. A heart-shaped, oddly allur-

ing hole completely pierces the palm of each

of  her  bloodless  hands.  Evening  Glorys  symbol  is

an open hand, pierced through the palm with a heart-

shaped hole.

The  Eternal  Lover  appeals  strongly  to  immortality

seekers, lovers, and undead. Still, anyone who has loved

and lost, or knows love and fears its end, is a potential worshiper

of Evening Glory. Most who worship her are undead, or soon

become undead after worshiping her for a time. Many of her

followers would rather welcome the followers of other faiths,

but it is hard to welcome members of faiths that believe undeath

must be eradicated.

Evening Glory teaches that desire is all that matters, and the

desire for the love of another should never be allowed to fail

through the depredations of age. Those whose love transcends

life should seek life everlasting through the grace of undeath.

The perfect preservation may freeze love forever. While the res-

urrection of tragically slain lovers may do for some, nothing can

stay old ages imperious  nal callnothing but the embrace of

undeath.

Portfolio: Love, beauty, immortality through undeath.

Domains: Charm, Magic, Protection.

Cleric Training: The training a cleric must undergo to be-

come fully vested by Evening Glory is a secret cloaked in love

and affection.

Quests: The clerics of Evening Glory are mainly pros-

elytizers, preaching about the continuance

of love (and, through this, the continuance

of existence after death).

Prayers:  All  prayers  to  Evening

Glory  extol  her  unchanging  perfec-

tion, a beauty frozen at its height by

the balm of death.

Temples:  Temples  to  the

Eternal  Lover  can  show  up

anywhere,  though  when  the

authorities realize the true nature

of the worship to this god, with its

undead  component,  those  temples  are

usually banned.

Rites: The rites of Evening Glory are

many,  but  the  mere  recitation  of  a  love

poem inspired by the goddess is considered

a daily obligation by her followers.

Herald and Allies: Evening Glory usually sends a

female lich as her herald. Planar allies are Medium, Large, and

Huge  re elementals.

Favored Weapon: Dagger.

NERULL

The Reaper, the Foe of All Good, Hater of Life, Bringer of Darkness,

King of All Gloom, the Reaper of Flesh

Greater Deity (Neutral Evil)

The  deity  of  death,  Nerull,  is  widely  known  and  widely

feared.  His  gaunt  form  resembles  a  mummi ednearly

skeletalcorpse with  aky red skin, thick blackish-

green hair, a cowled cloak of rusty black, and eyes,

teeth, and nails the color of poisonous verdigris. His

black staff (Lifecutter) forms a scythelike blade of

red force that slays anyone it touches. Nerull

makes his home on the plane of Carceri. His

Holy symbol

of Nerull

symbol is a skull and scythe.

Clerics  of  Nerull  are  secretive  and  solitary,

since  few  sane  people  tolerate  their  presence.

Except in the most evil lands, Nerull has no organized

church. Still, the Reaper is feared across the lands. His clerics

wear rust-red garb (when not in disguise).

Nerull is the patron of those who seek the greatest evil for

their own enjoyment or gain. All are equal in Nerulls cold realm.

Every living thing is an affront to the Reaper, and every death

brings a dark spark of joy to his long-dead heart.

Portfolio: Death, darkness, murder, underworld.

Domains: Death, Evil, Trickery.

Cleric Training: Some individuals are obsessed with death,

even as children, and those are potential recruits to the clergy

of Nerull. All must endure the  nal initiation rite: being buried

alive (for days or even weeks, sometimes). Though his undead

clerics arent alive per se, this can still be a painful process,

17

since they are left with no food for the duration. It is clearly a

more trying ordeal for his living protgs, since most of them

are transformed into undead through this very process.

Quests: Nerulls followers desecrate ancient tombs looking

for lost lore, establish cults to provide willing food for vampires,

and raise undead armies to terrify the world of the living.

Prayers: Much of Nerulls liturgy is spoken in the past tense,

even if it hasnt happened yet. For example, a cleric of Nerull

might pray, You granted me ultimate dominion over the dead

. . . Those who pray to Nerull to appease him only attract

his  attention  and  bring  about  their  own  doom.  Those

who kill in his name shall be rewarded (or so Nerull

promises).

Temples: Temples to Nerull are always hidden,

even in lands where the Reaper is honored. They

are usually located underground, often as parts of

catacomb complexes. Most temples are well stocked

with undead creatures and others that spread or cel-

ebrate death, such as hags,  ends, and vargouilles.

Rites: Nerull  nds little worth celebrating, other than

death. The number of different funereal rites Nerull has,

depending on who died and how, is staggering.

Nerulls clerics commit murders as offerings to their

deity. If their actions are discovered, they move

on to new hunting grounds. Some take up the

wandering life, putting on innocent faces as they

move from town to town, murdering a few

people and then moving on.

Herald and Allies: Nerull uses a night-

walker as his herald on the Material Plane.

Allies are shadow mastiffs, average salamanders, and cau-

chemar nightmares.

Favored Weapon: Scythe.

Holy symbol

of Orcus

ORCUS

Demon Prince of the Undead, Tenebrous

Demon Lord (Chaotic Evil)

Orcus  is  a  massive,  bloated  demon  princebloated  on

spite, bile, and contempt. Once complacent, his wars against

Demogorgon and Grazzt waning, he was murdered and deposed.

But then Orcus rose from the dead as an undead demon and took

the name Tenebrous, hiding in the shadows, waiting to take his

revenge. Now he has reinstated himself in his former position

and taken up residence in Naratyr, his terrible fortress-city in

the Abyss on Thanatos (the layer he rules). Once again, he  nds

himself in a struggle for dominance with many of the other

demon lords. He is no longer content to grow old and fat feeding

on larvae in his castle. Orcus lives in the Abyss. His symbol is

a skull-headed rod.

Orcus  appeals  most  to  demons,  necromancers,  and  the

undead. While not an actual god quite yet, Orcus is worshiped as

a god more often than any of the other demon princes. Although

Demogorgon might actually be more powerful, Orcus is closer

to ascending to true godhood. The cult of Orcus is widespread

among other groups as well, with a more signi cant following

among humanoids than most demon princes. In particular, orcs,

half-orcs, ogres, and giants revere Orcus, as well as corrupt and

despicable humans.

Orcus is, in many ways, a contradictory  gure. He does not

delight in his charges, the undead, and has not taken up the self-

proclaimed mantle of Prince of the Undead out of devotion or

allegiance. If anything, the demon lord despises the undeadhe

has little but contempt for them and uses them without thought

or consideration. Of course, Orcus despises the living as well. He

hates everything and everyone, often being almost overwhelmed

with revulsion and loathing. He craves only personal power and

the spread of misery and destruction for all others.

Portfolio: Undeath, revenge.

Domains: Chaos, Evil, Death, Darkness.

Cleric  Training:  Orcus  isnt  one  for  orderly  training  or

organization, so neither are his priests. Thus, training consists

of  little  more  than  a  grisly  oath,  the  introduction  to  the

mythology of Orcus, and a hearty strike with a skull-

headed rod to complete the process.

Quests:  Orcus  has  set  his  worshipers  the  task  of

increasing the level of his own worship across all lands,

killing  those  who  resistincluding  the  followers  of

other  evil  deities,  especially  Nerull.  Typical  quests

include  attacking  a  rival  Nerull-cultist  compound,

raiding a church of Pelor to destroy its sacred items, and

building or opening portals or gates from the Abyss to the

Material Plane.

Prayers:  The  most  common  refrain  in  a  prayer

to Orcus is a con rmatory phrase at the end of a

declaration, something like . . . or let Orcus strike

me dead and steal my eternal soul.

Temples:  Despite  his  status  as  a  demon  prince

rather than a true god, Orcus has inspired the creation of

temples  all  over  the  planes.  Those  that  worship  him  gain

clerical  power  as  if  worshiping  a  true  deity,  though  they

clearly  gain  that  power  from  some  more  universal  source

(perhaps from the Negative Energy Plane itself). His temples

are usually hidden, while his worshipers function as secret

societies  living  in  otherwise  normal  communities.  Other

temples,  however,  are  terrible  strongholds  full  of  undead,

where wicked lords commit atrocities and wage wars in the

demon princes name. Sometimes an entire orc tribe devotes

itself to the Prince of the Undead, but these individuals are

shunned even by other orcs.

Rites: Bloody con ict is the method that Orcuss followers

use to rise in the ranks. Sometimes this activity is formalized,

as when underlings challenge upper-echelon clerics according

to the Rite of Challenge. Of course, this usually results in the

underlings death before the Rite of Challenge can properly

occur.  In  fact,  the  Rite  of  Challenge  may  just  be  a  way  for

high-level clerics to identify troublemakers and weed them

from the  ock.

Herald  and  Allies:  A  balor  is  Orcuss  favorite  choice  for

herald.  Planar  allies  include  howlers,  glabrezu  demons,  and

nalfeshnee demons.

Favored Weapon: Mace.

FIGHTING UNDEAD

I  ght dragons because I want to. I  ght undead because I have to.

Jozan, cleric of Pelor

The undead. Perhaps no other type of creature conjures up such

utter revulsion in the minds of its opponents. Not only are such

creatures possessed of deadly powers, but their very existence

serves  to  remind  characters  of  the  eternal  punishments  that

may lie beyond the grave. Some undead even have the ability to

transform their fallen opponents into similarly twisted mocker-

ies of lifethe ultimate penalty for failure.

As formidable and unstoppable as undead sometimes seem,

they  also  have  their  vulnerabilities.  This  section  serves  as  a

guide  for  the  adventurer  who  must  face  these  living  dead

in  battle.  From  the  lowly  skeleton  to  the  mighty  lich,  every

undead creature has its own quirks and special abilities. If you

 ght undead in the same manner that you  ght ogres and dire

wolves, you will most likely come out on the losing end of the

battle before too long. If instead you learn which tactics to use

against the many undead foes you face, your chances of survival

increase dramatically.

KNOW YOUR FOE

Even counting only those that appear in the Monster Manual, a

wide variety of undead creatures exist in the D&D game. Many

are similar in appearance and/or tactics, which can become very

confusing to even the most seasoned adventurer. The hero who

mistakes a ghost for a wraith is at a distinct disadvantage, even

before a single attack is made.

The  most  useful  skill  in  identifying  undead  creatures  is

Knowledge (religion), since the teachings of the temple often

include information about these foes of all living clerics. When

you view an undead creature, you can identify its kind (ghoul,

wraith, mummy, and so on) by making a successful Knowledge

(religion) check as a free action. The DC of the check is 10 + the

creatures base HD. Dont include any extra HD from advance-

ment or class levels in this calculation. For creatures without a

base quantity of HD (such as a vampire or lich), set the DC at 20

or 10 + total HD, whichever is lower. If you can hear an undead

but not see it (for instance, a mummy shuf ing through the

darkness), add +5 to the DC when trying to identify it.

Once  you  have  identi ed  the  variety  of  undead  creature

you are facing, try to determine what special attacks, special

qualities, or vulnerabilities it might have. Once per round on

your turn, you can make another Knowledge (religion) check

as a free action to remember or  gure out an important bit of

information. For example, if you have identi ed your foe as a

wraith, you can attempt another check to remember that it has

a Constitution-draining touch attack, or that any humanoid it

slays rises as a wraith a few rounds later, or that it is powerless

in daylight. Each check reveals only one piece of information,

but  the  DM  can  choose  to  give  you  another  piece  of  useful

information  for  every  5  points  by  which  your  check  result

exceeds the DC.

The DM can modify the DC by 2 or more for undead deemed

particularly rare or common in the campaign. For instance, if

ghouls  are  prevalent  in  the  campaign  world,  the  DM  might

reduce  the  DC  to  identify  them  from  12  to  10,  since  most

people have seen or at least heard of ghouls. Conversely, when

introducing a new undead creature to the campaign, the DM

might increase the DC to identify it by 5 to re ect its rarity, at

least on the  rst couple of times characters encounter it.

Normally you cant retry a Knowledge checkyou simply

know an answer or you dontbut the DM may allow you to

retry a check to identify a creature or remember some bit of

information after you have learned something new about it.

For instance, if you fail to identify a ghoul before it attacks, you

might receive another chance to identify it after it paralyzes

your comrade.

Characters without much expertise in Knowledge (religion)

can use Gather Information to learn about undead creatures,

though this check typically only comes into play after a  rst

encounter with a particular kind of undead. Use the same DCs

as for the Knowledge (religion) checks.

KNOW ITS WEAKNESSES

Once youve identi ed what you face, the next step is to use

proper tactics based on your foes capabilities. While some

techniques  work  well  on  a  variety  of  undead,  whenever

possible  you  should  tailor  your  preparation  to  the  speci c

challenge you face.

Turning

The  rst tactic employed by characters against undead is typi-

cally turning (or rebuking, for those rare characters with that

ability). At low levels, turning undead is very effective. Because

multiple 1 HD and 2 HD creatures comprise reasonable chal-

lenges for a group of low-level characters, one use of the turning

ability can often remove multiple undead from an encounter.

Even as the characters reach 5th and 6th level, the turn undead

ability can often remove multiple weak undead creatures from

a mixed group.

The turn undead ability compares the clerics level with the

Hit Dice of the affected undead creatures. However, because

Hit Dice generally increase much faster than a creatures CR,

a cleric of 5th level or higher often faces undead creatures that

have more Hit Dice than he can possibly affect with his turn

undead ability. This means that high-level clerics are gener-

ally better off using their powerful spells or combat abilities

directly against undead creatures rather than turning them.

Positive Energy

Rotting sinews, missing tendons, and decomposing  esh  ex

in an obscene parody of life when they are  ushed with nega-

tive energy. Additional quantities of negative energy even heal

damage done to undead (see Undead Metabolism, earlier in this

chapter). Thus, it should come as no surprise that the opposed

energy of the multiverse, positive energy, has signi cant deleteri-

ous effects on moldering  esh.

Using Positive Energy: When positive energy is channeled

and brandished by servitors of good-aligned deities, undead can

be turned or even destroyed in a  ash. Evil servitors may also

choose to use positive energy to destroy undead, or subvert the

intentions of even intelligent undead to their own purposes by

holding this powerful force over their heads.

In general, a spell that channels positive energy deals as much

damage to an undead creature as it would heal damage in a living

creature. Healing effects that dont rely on positive energy (such

as some psionic powers) have no effect on undead.

If you can maneuver yourself into position to touch an undead

creature, you can deal a signi cant amount of damage with a

cure spell or a heal spell. Ranged options include the mass cure

wounds spells, mass heal, and disrupt undead. Holy water also uses

positive energy to damage undead creatures, and a paladins lay

on hands ability deals damage to undead creatures just as a cure

spell does.

Positive  Energy  Resistance:  Not  all  undead  are  equally

susceptible  to  the  harmful  effects  of  positive  energy.  Some

undead can resist the damage dealt to them by means of positive

energy resistance, while others can better resist being turned or

destroyed by the brandishing of positive energy in the service

of a deity. (See the Positive Energy Resistance and Improved

Turn Resistance feats in Chapter 2 for more details.)

Sunlight

A  number  of  undead  creatures  have  special  vulnerability  to

sunlight. Some, such as the spectre and the wraith, are merely

rendered powerless by sunlight. Others, such as the bodak and

the vampire, can be damaged or even destroyed by exposure

to sunlight.

or destroys sunlight-vulnerable undead at

Reason for Vulnerability: Why are some undead rendered

powerless by sunlight, while others are destroyed by it, and yet

others  can  blithely  ignore  it?  Many  have  suggested  theories

to  answer  that  question.  Some  early  scholars  suggested  that

sunlight  was  a  manifestation  of  positive  energy.  However,  if

that  were  the  case,  presumably  all  undead  would  have  some

vulnerability to it (or at least those without resistance to positive

energy), and since that does not seem to be the case, this theory

has been discredited.

Currently, the most accepted theory about why sunlight is

anathema to vampires, wraiths, and bodaks, among others, is

its undiluted strength and the life-giving effect it has on most

living creatures. Thus, some undead are just constitutionally

unable to accept exposure to sunlight as anything other than

a direct physical attack. Additionally, sunlight is light energy,

strong and pure. While some undead gain much by mimicking

the  exibility of life (such as the vampire) and others are strong

in shadow where no illumination can reach them (such as the

wraith), few can withstand the very radiation that engenders

growth in the world. When bathed in its rays, they are rendered

powerless or even disintegrated.

Sunlight Damage: Regardless of the effect, only real, direct

sunlight deals damage unless a creatures descriptive text speci -

cally states otherwise. For instance, despite its name, the daylight

spell doesnt have any special effect against undead, even those

vulnerable to sunlight. That said, even undead that dont have

any special vulnerability to sunlight take extra damage from

the sunlight-related spells listed in Table 15.

Enduring Sunlight: Some sunlight-vulnerable undead are

more resistant to the harmful effects of sunlight than others.

Instead  of  being  instantly  rendered  powerless,  or  destroyed,

these  undead  have  a  few  rounds  of  grace.  (See  the  Endure

Sunlight feat, page 26, for more details.)

Special Weapons

Many undead are resistant to certain kinds of physical attacks.

The wise adventurer learns to bring the right weapon to any

 ght against undead.

General Weapons: Even at low levels, you can prepare for

undead  encounters  by  carrying  both  a  bludgeoning  weapon

and a slashing weapon. Even if your secondary weapon doesnt

deal as much damage as your primary weapon, it will still be

better against those undead creatures with damage reduction,

particularly at low levels. Use your mace, club, warhammer, or

morningstar  against  skeletons,  while  relying  on  your  sword,

axe, or dagger against zombies.

Magic  Weapons:  The  most  common  weapon  needed

against undead creatures is a magic weapon. A weapon with

an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is needed to successfully

attack a wide variety of incorporeal undead, from the shadow

to the dread wraith. Make sure you have a +1 or better weapon

handy in any situation where you expect to encounter undead.

Barring that, pack a couple of scrolls or oils of magic weapon.

Special Weapons: Better still against incorporeal undead

are ghost touch weapons. At a price equivalent to a +1 bonus,

the ghost touch special ability is well within the reach of even

low- to mid-level adventurers. The ghost touch weapon spell (see

page  65)  allows  you  to  utilize  the  ability  for  a  limited  time,

and works well for characters who dont encounter incorporeal

undead with great frequency.

Other undead have special resistances or vulnerabilities to

take into account when arming yourself. A  aming (or  aming

burst) weapon works well against  re-vulnerable mummies.

Pack a silvered weapon for vampire spawn encounters, and if

you expect to run into the head vampire, carry a handy scroll

or oil of greater magic weapon as well. Dont even think about

going up against a lich without a magic bludgeoning weapon

in  the  party.  For  the  big,  bad  nightshades,  a  magic  silvered

weapon is a must (and when  ghting the item-crushing night-

walker or magic-draining nightwing, you might want to bring

a spare).

Wooden Stakes: Only vampires and vampire spawn are vul-

nerable to staking. Driving a wooden stake through a vampires

heart instantly slays the monster. However, those looking to

exploit a vampires vulnerability would do well to remember

that staking a vampire is only half the task, and if the body is

not dealt with, the vampire could return to shadow their steps

at a later date. A staked vampire will quickly return to life if the

stake is removed before the body has been destroyed properly

(such as by removing the creatures head and  lling its mouth

with holy wafers).

If a vampire is staked, but the body is left to rot away on its

own, the danger remains. Eventually, a lone stake might be all

that remains visible, driven into the earth, the dust of the slain

vampire long since blown away. However, if the stake is removed,

that dust reconstitutes, and the vampire returns to animation

within 72 hours.

Other Spells and Effects

A few other spells in the Players Handbook have other special

effects against undead creatures, as summarized in Table 16.

This list doesnt include spells speci cally designed to be used

against undead, such as command undead.

Disintegrate is a special case that bears mentioning. Though

this  spell  has  no  special  effect  against  undead  creatures,  the

fact that such creatures have very low Fortitude saves makes

disintegrate terri cally effective at destroying them.

DEFENSIVE TACTICS

While the best defense may well be a good

offense,  that  doesnt  mean  you  should

ignore  some  basic  protective  measures.

Undead creatures pack some of the nasti-

est special attacks around, and if you dont

prepare against those attacks, you dramati-

cally decrease your odds of survival.

Ability Damage and Drain

Many undead creatures, particularly incorpo-

real ones, have the ability to damage or drain ability

scores.  Ability  damage  and  drain  are  signi cantly

more  dif cult  to  heal  than  hit  point  damage,  and

they often have the secondary effect of reducing the

targets  ability  to  resist  or  survive  further  attacks.

Even a single hit from a shadow can make a big dif-

ference in your ability to  ght it off, and a

few of them teaming up against you

can make for a very quick (and

one-sided)  ght.

Dont  make  the  mistake  of

thinking  that  damage  or  drain  to

an unimportant ability isnt worth

worrying about. Fighters who take Wisdom or Charisma dam-

age or drain may not care about the immediate effects (since few

 ghters rely on skills or special powers based on those abilities),

but they are probably much more vulnerable to those abilities be-

ing reduced to 0, which takes them out of the  ght completely.

Though you cant easily protect yourself from ability damage

or  drain,  you  should  keep  handy  some  methods  of  restoring

lost ability score points. These spells can be costly, whether in

time, components, or both. Table 17 summarizes the various

methods available to characters, the casting time, and any cost

involved.  The  lowest-level  spell  that  can  cure  ability  damage

is lesser restoration, and every character should carry around at

least one potion or scroll of that spell as soon as he can afford it.

Restoration is the lowest-level spell that can offset ability drain.

Thus, its also a good idea to have at least one scroll of restoration

in the party at any given time.

to keep a scroll of death ward handy. Even if you dont run into

a bodak, banshee, or a spellcaster packing slay living or similar

magic, itll still help you against energy drain (see below). At

higher levels, mass death ward (see page 63) can protect the whole

party at a moments notice, or casters can protect themselves

with veil of undeath (see page 72).

Disease

A handful of rare undead creatures can infect their victims with

diseases. Nonetheless, youll rarely need access to a remove disease

spell in the  eld, since most diseases have lengthy incubation

periods and thus arent likely to kick in right away. The day after

 ghting any undead (particularly one youre not familiar with),

its a good idea for the cleric to cast remove disease on anyone who

came in contact with the creature, just in case.

The most commonly known disease associated with undead,

mummy rot, is actually a powerful and fast-acting curse. Youll

need remove curse (or its more powerful cousin, break enchant-

ment) to rid yourself of this horri c af iction. Unlike typical

diseases, mummy rot also sets in fast enough that youll want

access to such spells even while adventuring.

Energy Drain

Most characters fear energy drain more than almost any other

attack  form,  and  with  good  reason.  Like  ability  damage  or

drain, energy drain delivers the double whammy of reducing

your  adventuring  capabilities  while  simultaneously  putting

you  closer  to  death.  But  while  most  forms  of  ability  damage

or drain simply knock you out at the extreme of their effect,

energy drain can  at-out kill you (and possibly turn you into

an undead creature as well).

Whenever possible, guard yourself against energy-draining

attacks. Death ward is a common protection, though its short

duration means you have to know whats coming for it to be

useful. In the middle of combat, the cleric may  nd it dif cult to

reach you in time to cast this spell, though mass death ward (see

page 63) overcomes that restriction. For the high-level cleric or

wizard, veil of undeath (see page 71) provides foolproof protection

from this threat.

Even fewer resources exist for eliminating negative levels than

for healing ability damage or ability drain. These are summarized

in Table 18.

If you cant remove negative levels before 24 hours elapse, at least

make every effort to boost your Fortitude save before determin-

ing if they become permanent. Assuming you can know the time

when the save must be made with reasonable accuracy, bears

endurance is an effective method for doing so, but any spell that

increases Constitution or saving throws can help.

22

Fear

Though  most  undead  creatures  send  a  shudder  down  any

adventurers spine, only a few use the sheer power of magical

terror against their foes. The lichs fear aura is only effective

against the weakest of opponents, so you probably dont need

to worry about it. (If your level is low enough to be affected by

the lichs fear aura, youre better off running away anyway.) The

mummy, on the other hand, has a powerful despair ability that

can paralyze creatures that see it. Even tough the effect is of

short duration, it can cripple an unprepared adventuring group,

allowing the mummy valuable time to obliterate its foes. The

nightwalker also has a similar fear power, though it affects only

those creatures that meet its gaze.

Calm  emotions  can  suppress  fear  for  several  characters

simultaneously. Remove fear works both as a  x for a terri ed

character as well as protection against fear effects. Bless and

aid each grant a bonus on saves against fear, as does the bards

inspire courage ability and a paladins aura of courage. At higher

levels, spells such as heroes feast and greater heroism provide

immunity to fear. Whenever possible, take advantage of the

preventive nature of these spells and effects to avoid suffering

the fear entirely.

Potions of remove fear are cheap, but dont make the mistake of

handing them out to characters likely to fail their saves against

fear, since theyll be incapable of using the potions. Instead, leave

them in the hands of characters with good Will saves and the

speed to catch up with  eeing allies, such as monks.

Incorporealness

Incorporeal  creatures  often  prove  terrifying  to  adventurers

because they can bypass so many of the characters defenses.

No matter how tough your armor, shield, or hide is, the incor-

poreal touch attack of a shadow or spectre slips right through

to deliver its deadly effect.

Obviously, increasing your touch ACwhether by improv-

ing your Dexterity, picking up a ring of protection or other item

or effect that grants a de ection bonus, or adding some dodge

bonusesis the simplest and most effective method of guard-

ing  against  the  attacks  of  incorporeal  creatures.  Since  these

defenses also work perfectly well against other attack forms,

theyre ef cient as well.

Still, sometimes the ef cient methods arent enough. If you

 nd yourself  ghting a lot of incorporeal undead, you may need

more help against their attacks. Both mage armor and shield, since

their Armor Class bonuses are force-based, add to your touch AC

against incorporeal attacks. Ghost touch armor is a bit pricey,

but incredibly valuable against incorporeal creatures. Chapter 4

has several new spells that work well against incorporeal attacks,

such  as  ectoplasmic  armor  (which  increases  your  Armor  Class

against incorporeal touch attacks) and ectoplasmic shield (which

damages incorporeal creatures that strike you).

Paralysis

A wide range of undead creatures have paralyzing attacks, from

the ghoul to the lich. The simplest  x is remove paralysis (which

works on up to four creatures). Freedom works as well, though

its a bit of an overkill. The best antiparalysis spell is freedom of

movement. Not only does it free a paralyzed creature, it provides

immunity to paralysis (as well as a wide range of other bene ts)

for 10 minutes per caster level.

ainted  by  the  dark  power  of  negative  energy,  undead

embody some of the most dangerous and insidious foes

in the D&D game. This chapter provides feats bene cial to

both undead and living hunters of the undead, as well as

information about including undead in the party as player

characters. After all, sometimes the best way to learn about a foe

is to walk in its shoes. With your DMs guidance, you can opt

to play an undead character or add an undead familiar, cohort,

or other companion to your adventuring group.

NEW FEATS

This section presents several new feats. Many are intended to

help the adventurer battle undead enemies, while others enable

those same enemies to become even more fearsome.

DIVINE FEATS

The feats in this category share a number of characteristics that

restrict them to certain classes or class combinations. First,

they  all  have  as  a  prerequisite  the  ability  to  turn  or  rebuke

undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 3rd level

or higher, and a member of any prestige class or any creature

that has that ability.

Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to

channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead.

Each use of a divine feat costs a character a minimum of one

turning or rebuking attempt from her number of attempts each

day. If you dont have any turn or rebuke attempts left, you cant

use a divine feat. Turning or rebuking undead is a standard

action (unless you have a special ability that says otherwise).

These feats often take a standard action to activate, but may

require other types of actions as speci ed. Regardless, you

may activate only one divine feat (or use the ability to turn

or rebuke undead once) per round, though overlapping

durations may allow you the bene ts of more than one

divine feat at a time.

Third, turning or rebuking undead is a supernatural

ability and a standard action that does not provoke attacks

of opportunity and counts as an attack. Activating a divine

feat is also a supernatural ability and does not provoke

attacks of opportunity unless otherwise noted in the feat

description. Activating a divine feat is not considered

an attack unless the feats activation could be the direct

cause  of  damage  to  a  target.  Sacred  Vengeance,  for

example, adds 2d6 points of damage to all your melee

attacks, but does not directly deal damage to an oppo-

nent upon its activation. It is not itself an attack.

Paladins  in  particular  should  consider  these

feats. Because the paladins turning ability remains

behind the clerics throughout the paladins career,

a paladin who chooses one or two divine feats has

more options than just rebuking undead.

MONSTROUS FEATS

for 1 minute. This is a supernatural, sonic, necromantic, mind-

affecting, fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against

the moan cannot be affected by your moan for 24 hours.

Special: If you already have the frightful moan ability (see the

ghosts special attacks, page 117 of the Monster Manual), instead

of the normal bene ts of this feat, the DC to resist your frightful

moan ability increases by 2.

BOLSTER RESISTANCE [GENERAL]

Undead you raise or create are more resistant to turning than

normal.

Prerequisite: Corpsecrafter.

Bene  t: Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy

spell gains +4 turn resistance.

CONTAGIOUS PARALYSIS

[MONSTROUS]

Your paralyzing attack is contagious.

Prerequisite: Paralysis as an extraordinary or supernatural

ability.

Bene  t: Any creature paralyzed by your special attack can

confer paralysis to other creatures that touch it. Any creature

touching  a  creature  that  you  have  paralyzed  is  immediately

affected  as  if  you  had  delivered  a  paralyzing  attack  upon  it

(using the same save DC to resist, if allowed).

If a creature successfully saves against your contagious paraly-

sis attack, it cant be affected by your attack for 24 hours.

CORPSECRAFTER [GENERAL]

Undead you raise or create are tougher than normal.

Bene  t: Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy

spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and +2 hit points

per Hit Die.

CORRUPTED WILD SHAPE

[MONSTROUS]

You have learned to use the necromantic energy that powers

your undead form to overcome the inability of undead creatures

to wild shape. You can assume the form of an undead, rotten

creature with the use of your wild shape ability.

Prerequisites: Undead type, wild shape class feature.

Bene  ts: You can use your wild shape ability even though

you are undead. The ability functions just as if you were a living

creature using the ability, with the following exceptions.

You do not gain a Constitution score in the new form, and you

retain all the immunities of the undead type while in your new

form. The form you assume looks half-decayed, with missing

patches of fur and rotted, worm-eaten  esh. While you are in

this form, the rank odor of death hangs around you.

Normal: Since it is based on the polymorph spell, wild shape

works only on living creatures.

DAUNTING PRESENCE [GENERAL]

You are skilled at inducing fear in your opponents.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t: You may take a standard action to awe an opponent.

The opponent must be within 30 feet, have line of sight to you,

and have an Intelligence score. If the opponent fails a Will saving

throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modi er),

it is shaken for 10 minutes. This feat has no effect on a creature

that is already shaken.

Special: A  ghter may select Daunting Presence as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

DEADLY CHILL [GENERAL]

Undead you raise or create deal more damage than normal.

Prerequisite: Corpsecrafter.

Bene  t: Each corporeal undead you raise or create with any

necromancy spell deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with

its natural weapons.

(minimum 1 round). After this time, if you are still exposed

to sunlight, you take the normal effects as appropriate for your

kind.

DEATH MASTER [MONSTROUS]

Foes are especially afraid of your critical hits.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, undead type, Daunting Presence, base

attack bonus +1.

Bene  t: Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack

against a living foe, the foe is also shaken for 1 minute. This is

a mind-affecting, fear effect.

DESTRUCTION RETRIBUTION

[GENERAL]

Undead  you  raise  or  create  harbor  a  retributive  curse  that  is

unleashed if they are destroyed.

Prerequisite: Corpsecrafter.

Bene  t: Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy

spell releases a burst of negative energy upon its destruction,

dealing 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points per

2  Hit  Dice  to  every  creature  within  a  10-foot  spread  (Re ex

DC 15 half). This damage comes from negative energy, and it

therefore heals undead creatures.

DIVINE ACCURACY [DIVINE]

You can channel positive energy to give your allies melee attacks

another chance to strike true against incorporeal creatures.

Prerequisite: Ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Bene  t: Spend one of your turn or rebuke attempts to grant

all your allies (including yourself) within a 60-foot burst the

ability to reroll their miss chance with melee attacks whenever

they miss a foe because of a miss chance caused by incorporeal-

ness. This effect lasts for 1 minute and can be used once per

missed attack.

EMPOWERED ABILITY DAMAGE

[MONSTROUS]

Your  ability  damage  (or  ability  drain)  special  attack  is  more

potent than normal.

Prerequisites:  Cha  11,  undead  type,  incorporeal  subtype,

supernatural ability to drain or damage an ability score.

Bene  ts:  All  variable,  numeric  effects  of  an  empowered

ability damage or ability drain special attack are increased by

50%. For example, an allip with this feat drains 1-1/2 times the

normal amount of Wisdom (roll 1d4 and multiply the result by

1-1/2).

EMPOWER TURNING [GENERAL]

You can turn or rebuke greater numbers of undead with a single

turning attempt.

Prerequisite: Ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Bene  t: You can turn or rebuke more undead than usual.

After adding your cleric level and Charisma modi er to your

turning damage roll, multiply the result by 1-1/2.

ENDURE SUNLIGHT [MONSTROUS]

Your vulnerability to sunlight is reduced.

ENDURING LIFE [GENERAL]

You can ignore the effect of negative levels for a short time.

Bene  t: Whenever you would gain a negative level, you can

ignore the penalties and other ill effects associated with that

negative level for a number of minutes equal to your Constitu-

tion bonus (if any). For example, if Tordek (Con 15) is struck

by a wight, he gains one negative level. However, he can ignore

the 1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill

checks associated with that negative level for 2 minutes, since

his Constitution bonus is +2. (If Tordek were a spellcaster, he

would also avoid losing a spell slot for 2 minutes.)

You also gain a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to remove negative

levels.

ENERGIZE SPELL [METAMAGIC]

Your  spells  channel  positive  energy  to  deal  extra  damage  to

undead  creatures,  but  are  less  effective  against  other  oppo-

nents.

Prerequisites: Nonevil alignment, must not have the ability

to rebuke undead.

Bene  t:  Your  spells  are  infused  with  positive  energy.  An

energized spell deals an extra 50% damage to undead creatures,

but deals 50% less damage to nonundead creatures and to objects.

An energized spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

Special: A character who has the ability to channel negative

energy to rebuke or command undead cannot select this feat.

ENERVATE SPELL [METAMAGIC]

Your  spells  channel  negative  energy  to  deal  extra  damage  to

living creatures, but are less effective against unliving oppo-

nents.

Prerequisites: Nongood alignment, must not have the ability

to turn undead.

Bene  t: Your spells are infused with negative energy. An

enervated spell deals an extra 50% damage to living creatures,

but deals 50% less damage to constructs, undead, and objects.

An enervated spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than

the spells actual level.

Special: A character who has the ability to channel positive

energy to turn undead cannot select this feat.

EVISCERATOR [MONSTROUS]

The  allies  of  your  foes  are  especially  afraid  of  your  critical

hits.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, undead type, Death Master, Daunting

Presence, Improved Critical, base attack bonus +1.

Bene  t: Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack

against a living foe, creatures within 30 feet that are allied to

effect.

FELL ANIMATE [METAMAGIC]

slain outright by a fell animated spell, rises as a zombie under

your control at the beginning of your next action. Even if you

kill  several  creatures  with  a  single  fell  animated  spell,  you

cant create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster

level. The standard rules for controlling undead (see animate

dead, page 198 of the Players Handbook) apply to newly created

undead gained through this metamagic feat. A fell animated

spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spells

actual level.

must be an illithid to choose illithid grafts. You must be a yuan-ti

to choose yuan-ti grafts. There are no additional requirements

for choosing beholder or undead grafts.

You can create grafts of your chosen type and apply them to

other living creatures or to yourself. Creating a graft takes 24

hours for each 1,000 gp in its price. To create a graft, you must

spend 1/25 of the grafts price in XP and use up raw materials

costing half of this price. (See Chapter 5 of this book for pre-

requisites and other information on grafts.)

FELL DRAIN [METAMAGIC]

HARDENED FLESH [GENERAL]

Living foes damaged by your spell also gain a negative level.

Bene  t: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that

any living creature that is dealt damage also gains a negative

level. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit

Dice, it dies. Assuming the subject survives, the negative level

disappears (without requiring a Fortitude save) after a number

of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15). A fell drain-

ing spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells

actual level.

FELL FRIGHTEN [METAMAGIC]

Living foes damaged by your spell are also shaken.

Bene  t: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that

any creature subject to fear effects and mind-affecting spells and

abilities that is dealt damage also becomes shaken for 1 minute.

A fell frightening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than

the spells actual level.

FELL WEAKEN [METAMAGIC]

Living foes damaged by your spell are also weakened.

Bene  t: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that

any living creature that is dealt damage also takes a 4 penalty

to  Strength  for  1  minute.  Strength  penalties  from  multiple

spells enhanced by the Fell Weakening feat do not stack. A fell

weakening spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

GHOST SCARRED [GENERAL]

You are adept at  ghting incorporeal undead.

Prerequisite: Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.

Bene  t:  You  gain  a  +2  insight  bonus  on  attack  rolls  and

HEIGHTEN TURNING [GENERAL]

You  can  affect  more  powerful  undead  with  your  turning  or

rebuking attempts.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Extra Turning.

Bene  t: When you turn or rebuke undead, you may choose

a number no higher than your cleric level. Add that number

to your turning check, while subtracting it from your turning

damage roll.

If youre not a cleric, you may choose a number no higher

than your effective cleric level (for instance, a paladin could

choose a number up to two less than his paladin level). If a

prestige class increases your effective turning level, use your

effective turning level.

IMPROVED ENERGY DRAIN

[MONSTROUS]

You draw extra power from your energy-drained victims.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, energy drain supernatural ability.

Bene  ts:  Whenever  you  bestow  a  negative  level  upon  a

attack rolls, and saving throws for 1 hour.

IMPROVED PARALYSIS [MONSTROUS]

You are better at paralyzing your victims.

Prerequisites:  Undead  type,  paralysis  special  ability,

Ability Focus (paralysis).

Bene  t: When your natural attacks threaten to paralyze your

foe, add a +4 bonus to the save DC.

GHOSTLY GRASP [MONSTROUS]

IMPROVED TOUGHNESS [GENERAL]

You can handle corporeal objects even while incorporeal.

You are signi cantly tougher than normal.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, incorporeal subtype.

Bene  t: You can wear, wield, and otherwise use corporeal

items as though you were not incorporeal.

Special: Without this feat, an incorporeal creature can only

wear or wield items that have the ghost touch special ability.

Prerequisite: Base Fortitude save bonus +2.

Bene  t: You gain a number of hit points equal to your current

Hit Dice. Each time you gain a Hit Die (such as by gaining a

level), you gain 1 additional hit point. If you lose a Hit Die (such

as by losing a level), you lose 1 hit point permanently.

GRAFT FLESH [GENERAL]

You can apply a certain type of grafts to other living creatures

or to yourself.

Prerequisite: Heal 10 ranks.

Bene  t: Choose a type of graft: aboleth, beholder,  endish,

illithid, undead, or yuan-ti. You must be an aboleth to choose

aboleth grafts. You must be a  end to choose  endish grafts. You

IMPROVED TURN RESISTANCE

[MONSTROUS]

You have a better than normal chance to resist turning.

Prerequisite: Undead type.

command,  or  bolster  attempt,  add  +4  to  your  character  level

(monster Hit Dice plus class levels) to determine your Hit Dice

for turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts. For example,

a 4 HD wight with this feat is treated as an 8 HD undead for the

purpose of turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts, even

though it is a 4 HD creature for any other purpose. A vampire

that already has +4 turn resistance adds an additional +4 with

this feat, for a total of +8.

LASTING LIFE [GENERAL]

You can shed negative levels with an act of will.

Prerequisites: Endurance, Enduring Life.

Bene  t: Once per round as a standard action, you can attempt

to remove a negative level from yourself by attempting a Will

save (DC 10 + 1/2 attackers HD + attackers Cha modi er). If

the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes away. You

make a separate saving throw for each negative level you have

gained. If the save fails, you retain the negative level, but you

can try again next round to remove it.

LIFE DRAIN [MONSTROUS]

You drain additional life energy from your foes.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, energy drain supernatural ability.

Bene  ts:  Whenever  you  bestow  a  negative  level  upon  a

creature, add your Charisma modi er to the hit points lost by

the creature due to that negative level. You then gain tempo-

rary hit points equal to the amount lost by the creature due

to the negative level. These temporary hit points last for up to

1 hour.

For example, a creature touched by a spectre (Cha 15) with

this feat loses an additional 2 hit points due to each negative

level, and the spectre gains an additional 2 temporary hit points

from each negative level it bestows.

Special: Without this feat, a target loses 5 hit points each

time it gains a negative level, and the creature delivering the

negative level gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up to

1 hour.

LIFEBOND [MONSTROUS]

Select a speci c living creature that is friendly to you. You create

a special bond with that creature.

Prerequisites: Cha 11, undead type.

Bene  t: Whenever the chosen creature is within 60 feet, you

gain a +4 bonus to your turn resistance and a +2 bonus on all

saving throws.

If the chosen creature dies, you lose these bonuses and take

a 2 penalty on all saves for 24 hours.

If you replace the chosen creature with another living crea-

ture, the bond can be transferred at your option.

Special: This feat can be selected multiple times. Each time

you select this feat, you apply its effects to a different living ally

of yours. The effects of multiple lifebonded allies stack.

LIFESENSE [MONSTROUS]

You see the light that all living creatures emit.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Con  (no Constitution score).

Bene  ts:  In  addition  to  any  normal  light  that  might  be

present, your surroundings are illuminated by roving points

of brightness created by living creatures. To your eyes, a Medium

or smaller creature gives off life force suf cient to provide bright

illumination in a 60-foot radius, revealing itself and all features

and objects in range to your life-adapted sight. This life-light

behaves like regular lightyou cant see into solid objects, or

past solid walls.

A Large creature gives off life-light in a 120-foot radius, and

the radius doubles again for each additional size category larger

than Medium, up to a maximum radius of 960 feet for a Colossal

creature.

MOTHER CYST [GENERAL]

You gain the ability to cast necrotic cyst spells by growing a

cyst of your own.

Prerequisites:  Caster  level  1st,  Knowledge  (religion)  2

ranks.

Bene  t: You grow an internal cyst of undead  esh called a

mother cyst. The cyst may be noticeable as a discolored swelling

on your skin, if desired. The mother cyst is slightly painful, but

otherwise isnt harmful. The mother cyst grants you access to

a selection of cyst-related spells listed below (and described in

Chapter 4 of this book). You cast these spells like any other spell

you can cast, once you host a mother cyst (if you are a caster who

prepares spells, you can prepare all necrotic cyst spells without

referring to a spellbook, as if you had the Spell Mastery feat for

each such spell).

Necrotic Cyst Spells: 1stnecrotic awareness; 2ndnecrotic cyst,

necrotic  scrying;  3rdnecrotic  bloat;  4thnecrotic  domination;

5thnecrotic burst; 6thnecrotic eruption; 7thnecrotic tumor;

8thnecrotic empowerment; 9thnecrotic termination.

cyst spells.

NECROMANTIC MIGHT [GENERAL]

Undead you control gain bene ts when they are near you.

Prerequisite: Necromantic Presence.

Bene  t: Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of

you, they are physically inspired by your necromantic aura, and

gain a +2 enhancement bonus on their attack rolls and saving

throws.

NECROMANTIC PRESENCE

[GENERAL]

Undead  you  control  are  harder  to  turn  when  they  are  near

you.

Bene  t: Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of

you, they gain a +4 bonus to their turn resistance.

NECROTIC RESERVE [MONSTROUS]

You are not immediately destroyed when your hit points fall

to 0 or lower.

Prerequisites:  Cha  13,  supernatural  ability  to  drain  or

damage an ability score or drain energy.

Bene  ts: Each day that you slake your hunger by draining or

damaging a living creatures ability score, or draining a living

creatures life force, you gain a necrotic reserve. On days when

you have created a reserve, you are weakened but not destroyed

when you are dealt enough damage to reduce your hit points to

0 or lower.

A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic

reserve may take a single move action or standard action each

round (but not both, nor can it take full-round actions). It moves

at half speed. Taking move actions doesnt risk further injury,

but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM

deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting

a quickened spell) immediately expends the necrotic reserve.

Unless the action increased the weakened undeads hit points,

it is destroyed. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its

necrotic reserve is also destroyed if it is dealt additional damage

after the attack that  rst weakened it.

An undead may only rely on a necrotic reserve up to once

per day, even if it engages in additional feeding following its

successful return to positive hit points.

Normal: Undead reduced to 0 hit points or lower are imme-

diately destroyed.

NECROPOTENT

[GENERAL]

Your  special  melee  or

ranged  attack  with  one

type  of  weapon  is  especially

effective against undead.

Prerequisites:  Pro ciency  with  selected

against undead.

Special: A  ghter may select Necro-

potent as one of his  ghter bonus feats.

NIMBLE BONES

[GENERAL]

Undead you raise or create are faster and

more nimble than normal.

Prerequisite: Corpsecrafter.

Bene  t: Each undead you raise

or create with any necromancy

spell  gains  a  +4  bonus  on  ini-

tiative  checks  and  a  10-foot

increase to its base

land speed.

POSITIVE

[MONSTROUS]

You  are  resistant  to

the  damage  dealt

by  positive  energy

allow you to exceed your full notmal hit point total.

Special: This feat deals no damage to constructs or undead.

PROFANE VIGOR [DIVINE]

of physical damage.

Prerequisite: Cha 11, ability to rebuke undead.

Bene  t: As a standard action, you can spend one of your

healing does not allow the affected

undead to exceed their full normal hit

point totals.

QUICKEN

[MONSTROUS]

You can manifest from the Ethereal

Plane with a moments thought.

Prerequisite:

Ability to manifest

from the Ethereal

Plane  to  the  Mate-

rial Plane.

Bene  ts: Once per round, you

can  manifest  from  the  Ethereal

Plane  to  the  Material  Plane  as  a

free  action.  Turning  ethereal  still

Normal: Without this

feat,  manifesting

from  the  Ethe-

requires a stan-

dard action.

QUICKEN

TURNING

[GENERAL]

You can turn or rebuke

undead  with  a  moments

Prerequisite: Ability to turn

or rebuke undead.

Bene  t: You can turn or rebuke undead

such as cure spells.

PROFANE LIFELEECH [DIVINE]

You can channel negative energy to draw the life force from

nearby living creatures.

Prerequisite: Ability to rebuke undead.

Bene  t:  As  a  standard  action,  you  can  spend  two  of  your

rebuke  attempts  to  deal  1d6  points  of  damage  to  all  living

SACRED VENGEANCE [DIVINE]

You can channel energy to deal extra damage against undead

in melee.

Prerequisite: Ability to turn undead.

Bene  t:  As  a  free  action,  spend  one  of  your  turn  undead

attempts to add 2d6 points of damage to all your successful melee

attacks against undead until the end of the current round.

SACRED VITALITY [DIVINE]

You can channel positive energy to gain protection from damage

to your abilities or your life force.

Prerequisite: Ability to turn undead.

Bene  t:  As  a  standard  action,  you  can  spend  one  of  your

turning attempts to gain immunity to ability damage, ability

drain, and energy drain for 1 minute.

SPELL DRAIN [MONSTROUS]

You can cast any spell that you drain from a creatures mind.

Prerequisites:  Cha  15,  energy  drain  supernatural  ability,

Improved Energy Drain, caster level 5th.

Bene  ts: If you bestow a negative level upon a spellcasting

creature, and that creature loses a prepared spell, you gain the

ability to cast that spell once (as if you had prepared it). Treat the

spells effect as if it had been cast by the character who prepared

it (including caster level, save DC, and so forth). You need not

have the requisite ability score to cast the spell (for instance, you

need not have an Intelligence of 13 or higher to cast a  reball

drained from the mind of a wizard).

The spell remains in your mind for up to 1 hour. You can have

a maximum number of stolen spells equal to your Charisma

bonus (minimum 1); any spells that you would gain above this

number are simply lost.

This feat has no effect on spellcasters who dont prepare spells

(such as a sorcerer, who simply loses one spell slot for each nega-

tive level bestowed as normal) or who have no spells prepared

(such as a  ghter, or a wizard who has cast all her spells).

SPURN DEATHS TOUCH [DIVINE]

You can channel divine energy to remove some of the harmful

effects of attacks made by undead creatures.

Prerequisite: Ability to turn undead.

Bene  t:  As  a  standard  action  that  does  not  provoke

attacks of opportunity, you can spend one of your turning

attempts for the day to touch an ally to heal 1d4 points of

ability damage, remove a paralysis effect, or remove

a negative level. You can only use this effect to heal

ability  damage  dealt  by  an  undead  creature  or

remove effects caused by an undead creature.

STITCHED FLESH

FAMILIAR [GENERAL]

When you are ready and able to acquire a new

familiar, you may choose to gain a stitched

 esh familiar.

Prerequisites:  Ability  to  acquire  a  new

familiar,  ability  to  cast  three  or  more  necro-

mancy spells.

Bene  t: When choosing a familiar, you

may  choose  a  stitched   esh  familiar.

A stitched  esh familiar appears similar to any of the standard

familiars  available  in  the  Players  Handbook,  except  that  the

stitched  esh familiar is obviously sewn together from many

different creatures of that kind and, to a practiced eye, is clearly

an undead creature.

A stitched  esh familiar is magically linked to its master in

the  same  way  as  a  normal  familiar.  A  stitched   esh  familiar

uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the

Monster Manual, except as noted below.

Hit Dice: A stitched  esh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains

no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead

creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the masters

character level or the familiars normal Hit Dice total, whichever

is higher.

Hit Points: Use 1/2 the masters total or the familiars normal

total, whichever is higher.

Attacks: Use the masters base attack bonus or the familiars,

whichever is higher.

Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiars

base save bonus or the masters (as calculated from his character

level), whichever is higher.

Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Famil-

iars sidebar on page 52 of the Players Handbook to determine

additional  abilities,  just  as  you  would  for  a  normal  familiar.

Stitched  esh familiars do not grant their masters any of the

bene ts that appear on the  rst table in that sidebar. Instead

of the noted special ability, a stitched  esh familiar grants its

master the ability to control 4 more Hit Dice of undead than

he is normally capable of controlling (both through the rebuke

undead ability and through spells such as animate dead).

TOMB-BORN FORTITUDE [GENERAL]

The power of undeath taints you, body and soul. Its power has

hardened your  esh and given it the foul look of the grave.

Prerequisite: Nongood alignment, Tomb-Tainted Soul.

Bene  t: You have a 25% chance to resist critical hits. When

a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against you, there is a 25%

chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage

is instead rolled normally.

In addition, you do not risk death from massive damage.

Your skin takes on the pallor and texture of a dead creature of

your race.

TOMB-BORN

RESILIENCE [GENERAL]

The power of undeath taints you, deadening

your mind and body to the effects of mind-

controlling magic, poison, and disease.

Prerequisite: Nongood align-

ment, Tomb-Tainted Soul.

Bene  t: You gain a +2 bonus

on saving throws made to resist

mind-affecting spells and abili-

ties, poison, and disease.

Your nails or claws grow yellow and rot-

ten. Although this change has no effect on

the damage of your unarmed or natural at-

tacks, most individuals  nd such creatures

horrid-looking.

30

Stitched Flesh Familiar

TOMB-BORN VITALITY [GENERAL]

The power of undeath taints you, body and soul. Its power has

removed your need to sleep and eat.

Prerequisite: Nongood alignment, Tomb-Tainted Soul.

Bene  t: You do not need to sleep, and you are immune to

magic  sleep  effects.  If  you  are  a  spellcaster,  you  still  require

8 hours of uninterrupted rest (but not sleep) to prepare your

spells. In addition, you no longer need to eat.

Your  body  grows  unnaturally  thin,  your   esh  stretching

tightly over your bones to give you a freakish, skeletal appear-

ance.

TOMB-TAINTED SOUL [GENERAL]

Your soul is tainted by the foul touch of undeath.

Prerequisite: Nongood alignment.

Bene  t: You are healed by negative energy and harmed by

positive energy as if you were an undead creature. This feat gives

no other penalties or bene ts of the undead type.

UNDEAD LEADERSHIP [GENERAL]

You gain the service of loyal undead followers.

Prerequisites:  Character  level  6th,  nongood  alignment,

Knowledge (religion) 1 rank.

Bene  t: You attract followers and a cohort as if you had taken

the Leadership feat. Your leadership score is treated as 2 higher

than it otherwise would be for the purposes of attracting undead

followers and treated as 4 lower than it otherwise would be for

the purposes of attracting living followers.

If you choose to attract an undead cohort rather than a living

cohort, you can attract an undead cohort with a maximum effec-

tive character level equal to two less than your ECL. See page

106 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more information on the

Leadership feat.

Special: Like the standard Leadership feat, you must check

with your DM before selecting this feat, and work with your

DM to determine an appropriate cohort and followers for your

character. See the Undead Cohorts and Followers section, below,

for more information on choosing an undead creature as a cohort

or follower.

UNQUENCHABLE FLAME OF LIFE

[GENERAL]

You are hardened to the attacks of the undead.

Bene  t: You gain a +2 bonus on all saves against the extraor-

dinary or supernatural abilities of undead creatures.

Special: If you have selected undead as your favored enemy,

your bonus on saving throws is instead equal to your favored

enemy bonus against undead.

VAMPIRE HUNTER [GENERAL]

Your knowledge of vampires has given you the extraordinary

ability to detect subtle signs of their presence and to resist their

dominating gaze ability.

Prerequisite: Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks.

Bene  ts: You can take a move action to unfailingly determine

whether a vampire or vampire spawn is within 30 feet of you.

In addition, you are immune to the dominating gaze ability

of vampires and vampire spawn.

UNDEAD IN THE PARTY

Its a dead mans party/Who could ask for more?

Danny Elfman and Oingo Boingo, Dead Mans Party

As a twist on the standard game, the DM can allow players to

run undead characters, either a single character in a party made

up primarily of standard races, or an entire party of undead.

These undead characters might be the result of encounters with

undead enemies along the way, or might be created as undead

from the very start.

An undead character could also be added as a cohort or even

a mount or other ally, using the guidelines in this section.

UNDEAD ADVANTAGES

AND DISADVANTAGES

Perhaps the most obvious difference between a living character

and an undead character is the long list of immunities enjoyed

by the undead. Undead characters are immune to many of the

effects that plague the livingmind-affecting spells and abili-

ties such as charms and compulsions, poison, stunning, energy

drain and other physical effects, and extra damage from critical

hits. Some might say that its easier to list those effects that do

affect undead rather than all those that dont.

But  while  the  immunities  of  undead  creatures  are  indeed

useful, they come at a heavy price. Having no Constitution score

means an undead character rarely must make Fortitude saves,

but when he doessuch as against a disintegrate spellhis save

modi er is often woefully low. While the d12 Hit Die seems

attractive, thats no better than rolling d10 with a 12 Con, or d6

with a 16 Con. Most  ghters and even many clerics have as many

or more hit points per level than a typical undead creature.

Probably  the  greatest  disadvantage  to  playing  an  undead

character is the danger of immediate destruction upon reach-

ing 0 hit points. Without the buffer zone of the dying condition

(0 to 9 hp), combat tends to be far more dangerous for undead

characters. While Tordek can often keep  ghting until uncon-

sciousness, a vampire doesnt have that same option. Particularly

at lower levels, undead characters should either be careful in

combat or else invest in armor or magical protection.

And of course, undead creatures must worry about clerics of

all alignments. Its easy to see the threat posed by a cleric who

can turn or even destroy your character as a standard action

(with no save allowed), but dont forget about evil clerics who

can command undead to do their bidding.

Undead also face certain societal disadvantages in most cam-

paigns. While the sight of an orc or even an ogre walking down

the street might not send people running for coverdepending

on how cosmopolitan the community isthe sight of a ghoul

or a zombie is almost certain to draw attention. Depending on

the DM and the style of the campaign, this may affect game

play in a variety of ways, but in most cases undead characters

should face some degree of social stigma if they fail to disguise

their true nature.

Some speci c undead creatures have other advantages or dis-

advantages, such as incorporealness or vulnerability to sunlight,

which can affect their viability as characters in many ways.

All told, an undead character enjoys an edge over his living

allies. But thats where level adjustments come into play.

LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS

Some creaturessuch as most undeadare simply more power-

ful as player characters than their Hit Dice would indicate. Level

adjustments of +1 or higher help to even the score. A creatures

level  adjustment  is  added  to  its  total  Hit  Dice  to  arrive  at  its

effective  character  level  (or  ECL,  the  number  that  describes

the  creatures  overall  power  relative  to  a  character  from  the

Players Handbook). A 2 HD creature with a level adjustment of

+3 (such as a ghoul) is equivalent in power to a 5th-level player

character.  Table  22:  Undead  Level  Adjustments  and  ECLs

lists level adjustments and effective character levels for a few

of the undead creatures found in the Monster Manual and in

this book. Creatures not listed are either inappropriate for use

as player characters or cohortssuch as nonintelligent or most

incorporeal undeador have ECLs above 20.

Level  adjustment  helps  determine  the  maximum  level  of

each undead monster class (see Templates and Monster Classes,

below). Unlike other classes, a monster class has a maximum

number of levels equal to the creatures starting effective char-

acter level. For example, a mummys starting ECL is 13, so the

mummy monster class has thirteen levels.

When using the rules to create a character with one or more

levels in a monster class, you can ignore level adjustments. This

is replaced by your characters monster level.

TEMPLATES AND MONSTER CLASSES

Undead characters can be created in one of two basic ways. You

can either apply an undead template (such as those found in the

Monster Manual or in Chapter 6) to a character, or you can use

the undead monster classes featured later in this chapter.

The template approach is easy because it applies essentially

the  same  effects  regardless  of  the  characters  race  and  class.

Since it doesnt require multiclassing, spellcasters dont suffer

the severe disadvantage of losing spellcasting levels. However,

simply adding undead templates to one or more characters has

the possibility of seriously unbalancing your game. A vampire

character is much more powerful than a regular character with

the same number of class levels. Such templated characters must

forgo gaining one or more levels (to take into account the level

adjustment of such templates) or he is likely to outshine most

other characters in the party. A similar problem applies when

simply  using  a  stock  undead  creature  (such  as  the  ghoul  or

mummy from the Monster Manual)such creatures are more

powerful than their HD indicate, requiring a level adjustment

to  be  applied.  Either  way,  such  options  are  inappropriate  for

starting (1st-level) characters.

32

Using undead monster classes, such as those presented in the

last section of this chapter, provides a more gradual approach to

including undead player characters. A player who wants to play a

ghoul can begin as a balanced 1st-level character, without having

to apply level adjustments or wait until later in his career. Over

time, the character gains additional ghoul-related abilities until

he eventually becomes the equivalent of the ghoul appearing

in the Monster Manual. One drawback to this approach is that it

necessitates multiclassing, with all the good and bad side effects

that brings. Even a single-minded character eventually reaches

a maximum level limit in his undead monster class, requiring

him to choose another class to continue advancement.

UNDEAD COHORTS AND FOLLOWERS

With the right feat selection and your DMs consent, your char-

acter can gain the loyal service of an undead cohort or even a

small army of undead followers.

Cohorts: Just like a normal cohort, an undead cohort is effec-

tively another character under your control. Use the creatures

effective character level, as found in Table 22, to determine if

you can attract the desired creature as your cohort.

Example: A PC with a Leadership score of 12 can normally

attract a cohort of 8th level by selecting the Leadership feat.

Instead  of  selecting  an  8th-level   ghter  or  wizard,  he  could,

with his DMs permission, choose to attract an ECL 8 ghast.

If  he  instead  used  the  Undead  Leadership  feat  to  attract  the

undead cohort, he could gain the service of an ECL 10 undead.

The character can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels

lower than himself, regardless of his Leadership score.

Followers:  You  can  choose  to  attract  undead  creatures  as

followers gained from the Leadership feat (see page 106 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide), or the Undead Leadership feat (see page

31of this book).

Some undead that do not make good characters or cohorts

are acceptable as lower-level followers. These creatures are listed

below, along with the level that such a creature is considered to

be for determining whether you can have it as a follower. In a few

instances, these creatures are equivalent to a follower of a level

slightly different from their ECL. In most cases, this is because

the creatures are nonintelligent and have no level adjustment

but still work  ne as followers (not cohorts). In other cases, their

special abilities pose less of a threat to game balance when used

by a follower rather than an active adventurer such as a PC or a

more powerful cohort. The creatures obey the character without

question, but this control can be disrupted by clerical turning

or controlling abilities, spells, or other effects.

In general, DMs should be hesitant to allow characters to have

followers or cohorts that can create spawn. When an undead

cohort or follower creates a spawn, the creature must release or

destroy the spawn unless the character is of suf ciently high

level for the spawn to be a follower in its own right.

Example: A character with a Leadership score of 15 normally

attracts twenty 1st-level followers, two 2nd-level followers, and

one  3rd-level  follower.  If  he  wants  undead  followers,  he  can

attract twenty 1 HD skeletons, two 2 HD zombies, and one 3

HD skeleton. With the Undead Leadership feat and an effective

Leadership score of 17 when dealing with undead followers, he

can attract thirty 1 HD skeletons, three 2 HD zombies, one 3

HD skeleton, and one 5 HD zombie.

UNDEAD MOUNTS

nor does the bonus created by synergy with the Handle Animal

skill. An undead mount cant be spurred to greater speed.

On the other hand, upkeep for such a mount is extraordinarily

simple. It requires no food or water, no brushing, and virtually

no shelter.

A blackguard of 5th level or higher (see page 182 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide) can choose to call an undead horse or pony (skeleton

or zombie) instead of a  endish version of such a creature. This

undead servant has all the normal special abilities of a  endish

servant except for the empathic link, the speak with blackguard

ability, and an increased Intelligence score. If a blackguard also has

the undead companion ability from his level as a fallen paladin, he

can forgo gaining this companion and instead grant his undead

mount immunity to turning or rebuking.

Acquiring an undead mount isnt dif cult: Any character with

access to the animate dead spell and an appropriate skeleton or

corpse is only 75 gp worth of black onyx gems away from having

a light horse skeleton or zombie to use as a mount. However,

controlling such a mount in battle is not so easy. Though an

undead mount follows spoken commands, thats not the same

as having a mount that responds to the guidance of voice, hands,

and knees, like a typical horse.

Its simply harder to ride a nonintelligent undead mount than

it is to ride a traditional steed. As a result, the rider of an undead

mount takes a 2 penalty on all Ride checks. In addition, the

bonus on Ride checks from the Animal Af nity feat doesnt apply,

MONSTER CLASSES

This  section  presents  rules  for  treating  undead  as  character

classes. If you want to play an undead creature, particularly at

low levels or even from the start of your characters career, these

rules allow you to do that.

This  system  offers  an  alternative  to  the  monster  advance-

ment  system  presented  in  the  Monster  Manual.  While  a  DM

can advance monsters at will using that system, this method lets

players advance their monster characters gradually, until they

eventually reach the typical power level for such a monster.

This section describes  ve undead classes, each selected for

its playability and general coolness. A DM interested in adding

more undead classes can use this material (and the rules in Savage

Species) as guidelines for creating additional classes.

CREATING AN UNDEAD CHARACTER

One method of using these classes is to begin play as a 1st-level

undead character. To do so, follow the normal steps for creating

a starting character, including the selection of a race (such as

human or dwarf). Remember that even though youre playing a

ghoul or vampire spawn, you were something else before that,

and that something else is represented by your race.

An undead monster character gains the bene ts and draw-

backs  of  the  undead  type  (and  any  subtypes  associated  with

that kind of undead) at 1st level. The undead type replaces the

characters normal type. A monster class description does not

repeat information about the base creatures type or subtype;

see the Monster Manual for relevant information.

When you create an undead character at 1st level, roll ability

scores normally, including assigning a score to Constitution.

Because the character is undead, however, the character is treated

as having no Constitution score.

ENTERING AN UNDEAD CLASS

Normally, the only way to take a level of a monster class, such

as  those  described  in  this  chapter,  is  to  be  that  monster.  A

minotaur cannot freely multiclass as a mummy, nor

can a dwarf take levels as a vampire spawn whenever

he desires.

However, since these undead classes by de nition

represent a creature transformed from one form

into  another,  an  existing

character can become one of these monsters, thus (intention-

ally or not) multiclassing into that monster class.

When  a  living  character  becomes  one  of  these  forms  of

undeadfor instance, a dwarf  ghter slain by a vampires energy

drain attack who rises as a vampire spawn 1d4 days laterhe

loses one class level, much as if he had died and been raised. If

the character has only one class level, he loses that class level and

all features thereof. He then gains one level of the appropriate

undead class. Effectively, the undead class level replaces another

class level.

If the character has no class levels, he simply gains one level of

the appropriate undead class and may multiclass freely between

that undead class and normal class levels.

Examples: A 5th-level dwarf  ghter is slain by a vampires

energy drain attack. A few days after burial, he rises as a dwarf

4th-level   ghter/1st-level  vampire  spawn.  A  gnoll  with  no

class levels slain by the same vampire rises as a gnoll 1st-level

vampire spawn.

The undead monster classes described below have special rules

regarding multiclassing. Normally, a monster cant multiclass

between its monster class and its other class levels until it com-

pletes the full progression in its monster class. These classes work

a little differently. When a character begins taking levels in one

of the undead monster classes presented here, he must progress

all the way through the classs levels

before multiclassing in any other

class, including another monster

class. A character can interrupt

the  progression  of  a  normal

monster  class  to  take  levels

in an undead monster class,

but must then advance all

the way through the undead monster class and then  nish the

progression of his normal monster class before taking levels in

any other classes. A character cannot have levels in more than

one undead monster class.

Example: A character begins play using the minotaur monster

class from Savage Species. The character advances to 3rd level as

a minotaur and then multiclasses into the ghoul/ghast undead

monster  class.  The  character  must  then  advance  all  the  way

through  the  ghoul/ghast  monster  class  before  taking  any

other levels, eventually becoming an 11th-level character with

three  levels  in  minoutar  and  eight  in  ghoul/ghast.  Then  the

character must return to the minotaur class until completing

its progression, becoming a 6th-level minotaur/8th-level ghast.

From then on, the character can take class levels normally.

Characters who take levels in an undead monster class retain

all their normal class abilities, with one exception: A cleric who

becomes undead loses any ability to turn undead, but gains the

ability to rebuke undead.

HOW MONSTER CLASSES WORK

The undead monster classes described in this section use the

monster class rules detailed in Savage Species. You dont necessar-

ily need that book to use these classes. Undead monster classes

work just like other classes, with the following exceptions.

When using an undead monster class to create a character, you

can ignore level adjustment. This is replaced by the characters

monster class level. (The level adjustment is, in effect, built

into the monster classs level progression.)

Undead monster classes do not grant a character skill points

or Hit Dice at every level, nor do they grant a feat every three

levels. When a level grants skill points, a Hit Die, or a feat,

the gain is noted on the class table.

All of the undead monster classes described here grant natural

armor bonuses. The table for each class gives the total natural

armor bonus the creature has at that level. Do not add these

bonuses together, as is done for ability score increases. These

natural armor bonuses stack with any natural armor bonuses

granted by the creatures original race.

A monster class does not impose an experience penalty for

multiclassing, as other classes do.

All members of undead monster classes are of the undead

type  and  possess  the  following  undead  traits:  Immune  to

mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis,

stunning, and disease. Not subject to extra damage from criti-

cal hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, energy drain, or

death from massive damage. When an undead is reduced to

0 hit points, it is immediately destroyed. A destroyed undead

can be reanimated with a limited wish, wish, or miracle spell

(the  rst spell causes the undead to lose a level, the latter two

do not). A resurrection or true resurrection spell can bring an

undead back to life (the former spell causes the ex-undead

to lose a level, the latter one does not). An undead restored

to life loses all the levels it had taken in an undead monster

class, along with all the bene ts gained from those levels.

GHOUL/GHAST

Although usually portrayed as bloodthirsty killers content to

dine on carrion, ghouls (and their tougher cousins, the ghasts)

were once living humanoids with true emotions. Sometimes

memories of that previous life comes back to haunt a ghoul, and

such qualities make for an excellent tragic character.

Because of the similarity between ghouls and ghasts, a single

undead monster class covers both creatures. In effect, a ghoul

becomes a ghast at 6th level.

Adventures: A ghoul might turn to adventuring out of a wish to

avenge its death, protect a loved one, or destroy an old enemy.

Characteristics:  Ghouls  are  strong  characters  because  of

their combat ability, particularly their resistance to many kinds

of damage. Most of a ghouls power comes from the fact that it

is undead. On top of the standard undead immunities, it has

favorable ability score modi ers and (after 1st level) multiple

attacks per round. Although it is at risk of being destroyed or

controlled by a clerics use of positive or negative energy, even

the weakest ghoul has turn resistance.

Alignment: Ghouls are traditionally chaotic evil, though this

restriction can be relaxed in a campaign that features undead

player characters. Even so, most ghouls tend toward chaos and/or

evil. Lawful or good ghouls are extremely rare.

Religion: Ghouls, like most undead, rarely devote themselves

to any religion. As intelligent undead, ghouls are rightfully wary

of divine power. Those that seek out a divine power to follow

often gravitate to the worship of Orcus.

Background:  Some  ghouls  are  created  upon  the  death  of

a  living  individual  who  savored  the  taste  of  humanoid  esh.

Others are transformed by the bite of a ghoul or ghast; these

ghouls are the most likely to deviate from the normal ghoul

alignment of chaotic evil.

Races: Most ghouls were formerly human or a member of one

of the savage humanoid races (orcs, gnolls, goblinoids, and the

like). Evil dwarves sometimes prove wicked enough to transform

into ghouls, but elves, gnomes, and hal ings rarely descend to

such depths of depravity. Of course, any humanoid af icted by

ghoul fever might become a ghoul, even without resorting to

such behavior.

Other Undead Classes: Ghouls get along reasonably well

with wights, though they sometimes look down on the wights

lack of subtlety. They respect the power and vision of the mass-

murdering mohrgs, but vampire spawn are much too haughty

for a ghouls liking, and mummies are generally too lawful.

Role: Ghouls can serve as adequate front-line  ghters, but

they are better at scouting and skirmishing. A ghouls natural

cunning and agility lends itself to a role of stealth over sheer

power.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Dex, +2 Wis, Con .

Ghouls are more agile than humans and have a natural cunning

and  insight.  As  an  undead  creature,  a  ghoul  does  not  have  a

Constitution score.

Speed: A ghouls base land speed is the same as that of the

base race.

Darkvision: Ghouls can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Automatic  Languages:  Common.  Once  humanoids  them-

selves,  ghouls  remember  the  language  of  their  own  former

existence.

Favored Class: Ghoul. The best multiclass choices for a ghoul

are ranger, rogue, and  ghter. Those who choose to pursue spell-

casting classes often take well to sorcery or even the role of a

cleric, typically of a deity of death or undeath.

Class Skills

The ghouls class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Move Silently

(Dex), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modi er)  4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Hit Die: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  ghoul  monster

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Ghouls  are  pro cient

with all simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Bite: A ghoul has a bite attack that is a natural weapon dealing

the indicated damage plus its Strength bonus. The damage value

given is for Medium ghouls.

Claws: Beginning at 2nd level, a ghoul has two claw attacks

that are natural weapons dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2 its

Strength bonus. The damage value given is for Medium ghouls.

Paralysis (Ex): A creature hit by a bite or claw attack from a

ghoul of 2nd level or higher must succeed on a Fortitude save

(DC 10 + 1/2 ghouls HD from class levels + ghouls Cha modi er)

or be paralyzed for the indicated duration. Elves are immune to

the paralysis of ghouls of 7th level or lower.

Ghoul  Fever  (Su):  Diseasebite,  Fortitude  DC  10  +  1/2

ghouls HD from class levels + ghouls Cha modi er, incuba-

tion period 1 day, damage 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex. The save DC

is Charisma-based.

An  af icted  humanoid  who  dies  of  ghoul  fever  rises  as  a

ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul

in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It

is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for

the  esh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all

respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or higher rises as a ghast

(an 8th-level ghoul).

Stench (Ex): The stink of death and corruption surrounding

an  8th-level  ghoul  (also  known  as  a  ghast)  is  overwhelming.

Living  creatures  within  10  feet  must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude

save (DC 10 + 1/2 ghouls HD from class levels + ghouls Cha

modi er) or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature that suc-

cessfully saves cannot be affected by the same ghouls stench

for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the

effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to

poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive

their normal bonus on their saving throws.

MOHRG

A mohrg is the undead form of a horrifyingly evil individual,

typically a mass murderer or similar villain, who died without

atoning for his crimes. As punishment for a life of evil, a mohrg

is tortured by an endless existence dominated by an all-consum-

ing hatred of living things.

Adventures: Like any other normally viciously evil undead

creature, a mohrg that becomes an adventurer typically does so

either to further its horrid goals or to atone for its vile ways.

Characteristics: Mohrgs are extraordinarily strong and agile,

making them deadly combatants. A mohrg relies on its paralyz-

ing tongue and improved grab ability to quickly neutralize an

enemy, following up with brutal slam attacks.

Alignment: Mohrgs are traditionally chaotic evil, though

this  restriction  can  be  relaxed  somewhat  in  a  campaign  that

features  undead  player  characters.  Even  in  such  cases,  most

mohrgs  lean  strongly  toward  chaos  and  evil.  Good-aligned

mohrgs are virtually unknown.

Religion: Like other intelligent undead, mohrgs rarely come

into voluntary association with religions of any kind.

Background: Unlike most other undead creatures described

in this section, the most common trait among mohrgs is the

evil that they performed in life. As the animated corpse of an

unrepentant mass murderer or similarly vile person, a mohrg

is a tortured personi cation of pure evil.

Races: Among the civilized races, the pure evil necessary to

become a mohrg is found most often among humans and half-

orcs. Few other races possess both the murderous rage and the

ability to deal the amount of death necessary to damn oneself

to eternal unlife as a mohrg.

Other Undead Classes: Mohrgs have the greatest respect for

wights, which share their all-consuming hatred for the living.

Ghouls are mere pawns in the  ght against living creatures, and

mummies are dim-witted thugs. Vampire spawn have vision, a

quality that mohrgs respect, but they depend far too much on

the living for the mohrgs taste.

Role: Mohrgs are best as front-line warriors, thanks to their

powerful combat abilities. They also make  ne assassins, and if

they can rein in their murderous attitudes, can be good scouts

as well.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Str, Con . Mohrgs

are stronger than an average creature of the base race. As an

undead creature, a mohrg does not have a Constitution score.

Speed: A mohrgs land speed is the same as that of the base

race.

Darkvision: Mohrgs can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Automatic  Languages:  Common.  Once  humanoids  them-

selves, mohrgs remember the languages of their own former

existence.

Favored Class: Mohrg. The best multiclass choices for a mohrg

are  ghter or barbarian.

Class Skills

The mohrgs class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Climb (Str), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Spot

(Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modi er)  4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Hit Die: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the mohrg monster

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Mohrgs  are  pro cient

with all simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Slam: A mohrg has a slam attack that is a natural weapon

dealing  the  indicated  damage  plus  1-1/2  times  its  Strength

bonus.

Improved Grab (Ex): At 9th level, a mohrg gains the improved

grab ability. To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of its

size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start

a grapple without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Paralyzing Touch (Su): Beginning at 12th level, a mohrg

gains a paralyzing touch attack that it executes by lashing out

with its tongue. An opponent hit by a melee touch attack must

succeed  on  a  Fortitude  save  (DC  10  +  1/2  mohrgs  HD  from

class levels + mohrgs Cha modi er) or become paralyzed for

1d4 minutes.

Create Spawn (Su): Creatures killed by a mohrg rise after

1d4  days  as  zombies  under  the  morhgs  control.  They  do  not

possess any of the abilities they had in life.

MUMMY

A mummy is a preserved corpse, typically animated through the

auspices of dark desert gods. Traditionally, mummies serve as

guardians of tombs or temples, destroying intruders or thieves

who desecrate those areas.

Adventures:  What  could  bring  a  mummy  to  abandon  its

eternal vigilance and take up the career of a traveling adven-

turer? Some are seekers of vengeance, pursuing grave robbers

or desecrators of the dead. Others have memories of their lives

long past, in which they performed feats of daring or heroism.

Alternatively, this creature of the dead might seek to end its

years of service to uncaring powers, and perhaps even long to

pursue a more noble calling.

Characteristics: The mummy has in its repertoire despair,

mummy  rot,  improved  ability  scores,  natural  armor,  and  its

status as an undead creature. The undead status comes  rst, and

because of this type advantage, a mummy must wait for several

levels to acquire any special abilities. What is frequently the most

feared aspect of an encounter with a hostile mummy, its super-

natural rotting disease, does not add much to the effectiveness of

a player character mummy. While PCs must deal with long-term

consequences such as diseases and curses, the typical monster

wont be alive long enough for the disease to matteror if it

is, its only because the player characters have met an untimely

end. The mummys despair ability, on the other hand, is much

more useful, even if it is troublesome for companions to deal

with its paralyzing visage each morning.

Alignment: Mummies are usually lawful evil, but exceptions

to this alignment are much more common than for most undead

creatures.  In  fact,  of  all  the  undead  monster  races  presented

here, the mummy is perhaps the most likely to follow the path

of good. Most retain their lawful tendency, as be ts their typical

role as guardians.

Religion: Unlike most other intelligent undead, mummies

often have ties to established religions, either having been cre-

ated speci cally to guard the tombs of the dead or having once

been priests themselves.

Background: Mummies are always created, never spawned.

Some are the ancient guardians of long-deserted tombs, while

others are the more recent creations of powerful necromancers

or evil priests. Rarely, an otherwise noble or good individual

might  be  transformed  by  divine  powers  into  a  mummy  as

punishment or a curse for transgressions (real or imagined).

Races: Creatures of all humanoid races can become mum-

mies, though most are from highly religious cultures inhabiting

desert lands. For that reason, sylvan races such as elves or half-

lings rarely practice techniques of mummi cation.

Other Undead Classes: Mummies interact poorly with most

other undead. They  nd  esh-eating or blood-drinking undead

creatures such as ghouls and vampire spawn distasteful, and have

little patience for the chaotic nature of most undead, particularly

the hateful mohrgs. Wights at least share some of the mummies

disciplined nature, and mummies can  nd common cause with

them against a shared enemy.

Role: Mummies are formidable combatants. They are usually

insightful and possessed of strong personalities, but dont have

the intellect to serve effectively as leaders. They are often very

spiritual, and one may serve as a groups conscience.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Str, Con , 4 Int.

Mummies  are  strong  but  slow,  and  they  tend  to  be  single-

minded.  As  an  undead  creature,  a  mummy  does  not  have  a

Constitution score.

Speed: A mummys base land speed is 10 feet slower than that

of the base race, to a minimum of 10 feet.

Darkvision: Mummies can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

Vulnerability to Fire: A mummy takes half again as much

(+50%) damage as normal from  re attacks.

Damage Reduction: A mummy gains damage reduction as it

advances in level, as noted on the accompanying table.

Automatic  Languages:  Common.  Once  humanoids  them-

selves, mummies remember the languages of their own former

existence.  Mummies  often  study  rare  or  exotic  languages  to

preserve their connection to an ancient past.

Favored  Class:  Mummy.  The  best  multiclass  choice  for  a

mummy  is   ghter,  though  sorcerer  and  cleric  can  also  be

interesting choices. A unique mummy paladin or bard could

be an intriguing character.

Class Skills

The mummys class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modi er)  4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Hit Die: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the mummy monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Mummies are pro cient

with all simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Slam: A mummy has a slam attack that is a natural weapon deal-

ing the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus.

Mummy  Rot  (Su):  Starting  at  5th  level,  once  per  day  a

mummy  can  infect  a  creature  hit  by  its  slam  attack  with

mummy rot. At 8th level it can do this three times per day, and

at 12th level every one of its slam attacks can bring about the

disease if the mummy wishes. Mummy rot is a supernatural

diseaseFortitude save DC 10 + 1/2 mummys HD from class

levels + mummys Cha modi er, incubation period 1 minute;

damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha.

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot persists until the victim

reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below.

Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A charac-

ter attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature

af icted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level

check, or the spell has no effect on the af icted character.

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must  rst be broken with

break enchantment or remove curse (requiring a DC 20 caster level

check for either spell), after which a caster level check is no

longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the

mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease.

An af icted creature that dies of mummy rot shrivels away into

sand and dust that blow away into nothing at the  rst wind.

Despair (Su): A mummy of 10th level or higher causes fear in

any creature that views it. Such a creature must succeed on a Will

save (DC 10 + 1/2 mummys HD from class levels + mummys

Cha modi er) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether

or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected

again by that mummys despair ability for 24 hours.

VAMPIRE SPAWN

Forever anchored to their unholy graves, the nocturnal predators

known as vampire spawn scheme for power. They tend toward

decadence,  believing  themselves  superior  to  other  living  (or

undead) creatures.

Would-be player character vampires are limited to advancing

as free-willed vampire spawn. In order to take the class described

here, a character must die as a result of a vampires energy drain

(or as a victim of its blood drain if the character has less than

5 HD). Characters with 5 or more Hit Dice who are killed by a

vampires blood drain must acquire the vampire template (see

page 250 of the Monster Manual), and its +8 level adjustment

places that template beyond the scope of the monster classes

presented here.

Adventures: A vampire spawn might turn to adventuring

to gain revenge upon the bloodsucking  end that cursed it to

eternal unlife, or as penance for untold years of spreading evil

and death. Those that can overcome (or ignore) their emotions

may instead seek knowledge, power, or both.

Characteristics: Vampire spawn have great talents of stealth and

persuasion. They can stand their ground in melee combat, knowing

that an easy escape (whether by gaseous form or spider climb) is

always available. Their blood drain, domination, and energy drain

abilities make them the bane of most living creatures.

Alignment: Vampire spawn are traditionally evil, though a

DM may relax this restriction in a campaign that features undead

player characters. The innate sel shness of the typical vampire

spawn makes a good alignment dif cult to uphold.

Religion:  Like  other  intelligent  undead,  vampire  spawn

rarely voluntarily associate with religion of any kind.

Background:  Unlike  with  most  other  undead  creatures,

every vampire spawn is the creation of a true vampire. In some

cases, entire societies or cultures of vampire spawn exist in the

shadows of normal civilization, hewing to their own arcane rules

of behavior, often set down by one or more original procreators

of the culture.

Races: Vampire spawn come from all humanoid races. They

tend to be more common among the civilized racesincluding

humans, elves, and half-elvesthan the savage tribal races. That

said, the ferocity of a half-orc or gnoll vampire spawn is indeed

something to be reckoned with.

Other Undead Classes: Vampire spawn look down on all

other undead as lesser beings, regardless of the actual power

of  such  creatures.  Still,  some  of  the  other  undead  have  their

placeghouls and wights make  ne soldiers, and some vampire

spawn use mummies or mohrgs as bodyguards.

Role:  Vampire  spawn  are  natural  leaders,  and  they  know

it.  They  are  smart,  insightful,  and  charismatic,  though  their

sense of superiority often leads them to take on tasks best left

to subordinates. Vampire spawn make excellent warriors and

also  ne scouts or assassins.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Str, +2 Cha, Con .

Vampire spawn are stronger than humans and arrogant enough

to consider most humanoids little more than prey. As an undead

creature, a vampire spawn does not have a Constitution score.

Speed: A vampire spawns base land speed is the same as that

of the base race.

Darkvision: Vampire spawn can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Bluff  checks.  Vampire  spawn  are  very

persuasive.

+2 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Vampire

spawn are quiet and sneaky.

+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot

checks. Vampire spawn are very perceptive.

Vampire Spawn Weaknesses: Vampire spawn are vulnerable

to all attacks and effects that repel or slay vampires. See Vampire

Weaknesses, page 253 of the Monster Manual.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored Class: Vampire spawn. The best multiclass choices

for a vampire spawn are  ghter, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard.

Class Skills

The vampire spawns class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),

Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profes-

sion (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modi er)  4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Hit Die: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  vampire  spawn

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Vampire spawn are pro-

 cient with all simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Bonus Feats: Vampire spawn gain Alertness at 2nd level,

Lightning  Re exes  at  5th  level,  and  Improved  Initiative  at

8th level.

Blood Drain (Ex): A vampire spawn can suck blood from

a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple

check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of

Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each

such successful attack, a vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit

points that last for up to 1 hour.

Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces

as though with a spider climb spell.

Skill Bonus (Ex): At 4th level, a vampire spawns racial bonus

on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and

Spot checks increases from +2 to +4.

Fast Healing (Ex): A vampire spawn gains fast healing 1 at

5th level. At 8th level, this improves to fast healing 2. A vampire

spawn heals damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit

point.  If  reduced  to  0  hit  points  in  combat,  it  automatically

assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its

cof n home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel

up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest in its cof n, it is helpless.

It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and

resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire spawn

can assume gaseous form at will, as the spell (caster level 5th),

but it can remain gaseous inde nitely and has a  y speed of 20

feet with perfect maneuverability.

Domination (Su): A vampire spawn can crush an opponents

will just by looking into his or her eyes. This effect is similar to

a gaze attack, except that the vampire spawn must use a standard

action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone

the vampire spawn targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 10

+ 1/2 vampire spawns HD from class levels + vampire spawns

Cha modi er) or fall instantly under the vampire spawns in u-

ence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The

ability has a range of 30 feet.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a vampire spawns

slam attack gain one negative level. The Fortitude save to remove

a negative level is DC 10 + 1/2 vampire spawns HD from class

levels + vampire spawns Cha modi er. For each such negative

level bestowed, a vampire spawn gains 5 temporary hit points

that last for up to 1 hour.

WIGHT

The  wight  is  an  undead  creature  given  a  semblance  of  life

through  sheer  violence  and  hatred.  It  is  spiteful  and  cruel,

seeking  only  to  destroy  all  living  creatures.  Even  those  rare

few that overcome their pure hatred of all living things remain

jealous of such creatures.

Adventures: Wights prefer lurking in places that reek with

death, though some leave such lairs to seek out additional victims.

Those that are less murderous might seek adventure as a way of

righting the scales for the evil they have done in the past, or as

vengeance against those that put them in this form.

Characteristics: Wights are strong of will and personality.

Though hateful and violent, they are much more disciplined

than other undead creatures that share these tendencies, such as

mohrgs. They are naturally stealthy, making them good scouts

or assassins.

Alignment: Wights are traditionally lawful evil, though this

restriction can be relaxed in a campaign that features undead

player characters. Even so, most wights lean strongly toward

evil. Good-aligned wights are exceedingly rare, and even neutral

wights are rare.

Religion: Like other intelligent undead, wights rarely come

into voluntary association with religions of any kind.

Background:  Some  wights  are  cursed  to  walk  the  earth

because of their violent and horrid lives, but a good many are

merely the victims of other wights, themselves spawned from

violence. Wights spawned by other wights are more likely to

have alignments differing from the traditional lawful evil.

Races: Wights are most often former humans or members

of  evil  humanoid  races  (such  as  hobgoblins  or  orcs).  Some

particularly vile dwarves become wights, but other races only

rarely are so cursed. Of course, any humanoid can become a

wight through the actions of another wight.

Other Undead Classes: Wights get along well with mum-

mies, since these sorts of undead share a level of discipline. They

respect the cunning of ghouls, and the mohrgs all-consuming

hatred of living things, but in general  nd both of those creatures

too savage. They see vampire spawn as embarrassing poseurs,

trying far too hard to pass themselves off as living beings.

Role: A wight is a competent combatant, though its strengths

lie in stealth and patience. A wight can make an excellent group

leader, assuming the others in the group can put up with its cold,

festering hatred.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Dex, Con . Wights

are agile and sneaky. As an undead creature, a wight does not

have a Constitution score.

Speed: A wights base land speed is the same as that of the

base race.

Darkvision: Wights can see in the dark out to 60 feet.

+8 racial bonus on Move Silently checks. Wights are especially

good at moving quietly in pursuit of their prey.

Automatic  Languages:  Common.  Once  humanoids  them-

selves,  wights  remember  the  languages  of  their  own  former

existence.

Favored Class: Wight. The best multiclass choice for a wight

is rogue.

Class Skills

The wights class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modi er)  4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Hit Die: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the wight monster class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Wights  are  pro cient

with all simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Slam: A wight has a slam attack that is a natural weapon deal-

ing the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes

a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the

wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death.

They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by an 8th-level wights

slam attack gain one negative level. The Fortitude save to remove

this negative level is DC 10 + 1/2 wights HD from class levels +

wights Cha modi er). For each such negative level bestowed, a

wight gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

ach of the prestige classes included here is appropriate for

campaigns in which undead play a signi cant role. Some

cast themselves in the role of enemies of the living dead,

while others serve as their masters, allies, or minions.

DEATHS CHOSEN

For the glory of the Deathless One!

From time to time, mortal beings choose to pledge their lives

to the service of a powerful undead creature. Some are terri-

 ed of their own mortality and hope that in return for faithful

service, the master will consent to make the chosen into one of

its spawn in due time. Others are hateful folk who view service

to an undead master as an instrument of vengeance against

those who have slighted them, whether those slights are real or

imagined. A rare few deaths chosen exist to support an undead

creature they perceive as having special knowledge or value,

and thus they serve as a matter of duty and honor.

If accepted by his would-be master, a deaths chosen serves

as the masters living minion. The chosen gains great vigor and

power in the service of his master, but slowly becomes tainted

by close proximity to his masters unholy power.

Becoming a deaths chosen necessitates turning ones back

on life and the living. The demands of the master are all that

mattereven if the master hungers for the blood or souls of the

living. A loyal deaths chosen can be a great boon to a powerful

and predatory undead. He can go places the master cannot,

and can help his master overcome its supernatural vulner-

abilities. For example, a deaths chosen in the service of a

vampire can lure unsuspecting victims into the vampires

lair, spy on those plotting against his master in the sanctity

of a hallowed church, or move his masters cof n to a new

lair during the hours of hateful sunlight.

Fighters are the most common deaths chosen, since

most  undead  understand  the  utility  of  a  bodyguard.

Barbarians, rogues, assassins, and monks can also serve

effectively as a deaths chosen. Spellcasters rarely become

deaths chosen, though some clerics dedicated to gods

of death take up this mantle.

NPC members of this prestige class typically remain

close to their masters, though they sometimes venture

forth on important missions. Individual deaths chosen

dont have any special allegiance to one another. They

serve their masters above all else.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a deaths chosen, a character

must ful ll all the following criteria.

Type:  Aberration,  dragon,  giant,  humanoid,

magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills:  Knowledge  (religion)  1  rank,  Spot  2

ranks.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  deaths

chosen prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:

Deaths  chosen  gain  no  pro ciency

with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Shield  of  the  Master  (Ex):

Bravery of the Chosen (Ex): When within 30 feet of his

master, a deaths chosen who has attained 3rd level gains a +1

morale bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls. If

his master has been reduced to half or less of its full normal hit

points, this bonus increases to +2. The bonus disappears if his

master is destroyed.

Unnatural Aura (Su): When a deaths chosen reaches 3rd

level,  wild  or  domesticated  animals  can  sense  his

unnatural presence out to a distance of 30 feet. The

animals do not willingly approach nearer than

that and become panicked if forced to do so.

They remain panicked as long as they

are within that distance.

Whenever  the  master  of

a  deaths  chosen  casts  a

spell  or  uses  an  extraor-

dinary,  supernatural,  or

spell-like  ability,  it

can  choose  (as  a  free

action)  to  exempt  the

deaths  chosen  from  its

effects. The master must

make this choice when

it casts the spell or uses

the ability. If the ability

is always active, the mas-

ter can choose to exempt its

deaths chosen from the

effect; this immunity

remains in effect un-

til the master chooses

otherwise.

For example, a mummy

could  (and  probably

would)  choose  to

make  its  deaths

chosen  immune

to its despair abil-

ity.  An  undead

spellcaster  cast-

ing a  reball into

a  ght  that  in-

cluded its deaths chosen could choose when casting the spell

to have it not affect the deaths chosen.

Larrak, a deaths chosen

Vigor of the Chosen (Ex): The physical needs of a deaths

chosen are greatly reduced. He needs to consume only one-tenth

the normal amount of food and water each daya few grubs

and a mouthful of water make a full meal. He can subsist on a

mere 2 hours of sleep each night without becoming fatigued

(though spellcasters require the normal amount of rest to regain

spells). He gains Endurance as a bonus feat (or, if he already has

the feat, the bonuses granted by the feat increase to +8). He also

gains a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease.

Will of the Chosen (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a deaths chosen

serves his master with inhuman intensity. He gains a +2 morale

bonus on Will saves as long as he is within 60 feet of his master.

the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these fallen bards want

nothing more than for others to understand the depths of their

loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy has

been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the

joy of others by using their powers to teach folk the folly of love,

the futility of hope, and the  nality of the grave. Dirgesingers of

this last sort often associate themselves with powerful undead,

serving in the courts of vampire lords or lich-kings.

All dirgesingers must have at least some expertise as a bard.

Some are also trained as rogues or clerics before entering this

class.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a dirgesinger, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills:  Knowledge  (religion)  4  ranks,  Perform  (any)  8

ranks.

Feat: Requiem.

Special: Bardic music class feature.

DIRGESINGER

Dirgesingers voice melodies not of celebration and joy, but of

sorrow and grief. They seek to spread this melancholy outlook far

and wide, believing that only those who give in to their sadness

can truly understand the world.

Dirgesingers  hold  high  positions

in death-obsessed cultures. Serving

as  members  of  a  secret  guild  or  as

part of a hierarchy of death priests,

they are entrusted with the

serious  responsibility  of

composing suitable laments

for  the  dead.  The  more

important  the  deceased,

the  more  sorrowful  and

moving her lament is ex-

pected to be. No one will

remember  the  dead  queen

in a few short generations, but

a great lament might be sung a

thousand years hence.

However,  most  dirge-

singers  do  not  belong  to

any  special  hierarchy

or  guild.  Instead,  they

are  rootless  wanderers

who travel from place

to  place,  wrapped

in  inconsolable

grief from some

personal  tragedy.

These  sad  wander-

ers  seek  to  express

their grief through

songs  that  teach  the

hearts of their listeners

The dirgesingers class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Bluff  (Cha),  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Diplomacy

(Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge

(religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis),

and Speak Language (n/a).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Dirgesingers  gain  no

weapons,  armor,  or

Dirgesong  (Su):

A  dirgesinger  gains  the

dirgesong  ability.

Dirgesong  follows

the same rules as bardic music

(see Bardic Music, page 29 of

the Players Handbook). Dir-

gesinger  levels  stack  with

bard levels for the purpose of

determining how often a char-

acter can use dirgesong or bardic

music. Dirgesinger levels do not stack

with bard levels for determining which

bardic music effects and spells a bard has

access to. Each of these songs counts as a

use of bardic music.

Song of Sorrow: A dirgesinger can evoke sorrow and lament in

his enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the

dirgesinger perform. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears

the dirgesinger perform and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected

enemy takes a 2 penalty on Will saving throws and a 2 penalty

on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. A successful Will save

(DC 10 + the dirgesingers ranks in Perform) negates the effect and

makes the character immune to that dirgesingers song of sorrow

ability for 24 hours. Song of sorrow is a mind-affecting ability.

Song of Bolstering: At 2nd level and higher, a dirgesinger can

bolster undead creatures against turning, much as an evil cleric

does. All undead within 30 feet of the dirgesinger gain a bonus

on  their  turn  resistance  equal  to  the  dirgesingers  class  level

plus the dirgesingers bard class level. The bolstering lasts for as

long as the dirgesinger performs and for 10 rounds thereafter.

An undead dirgesinger can bolster himself in this manner.

Song of Grief: A dirgesinger of 3rd level or higher can use song

or poetics to inspire maddening grief in a living creature. The

creature must be within 60 feet of the dirgesinger and able to

hear him. Unless the target succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + the

dirgesingers ranks in Perform), she becomes confused for as long

as the dirgesinger performs and for 5 rounds thereafter. Song of

grief is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.

Song of Horror: At 4th level and higher, a dirgesinger can strike

a  horrifying  chord  in  the  hearts  of  his  enemies.  Any  enemy

within 60 feet who can hear the dirgesinger must succeed on a

Will save (DC 10 + the dirgesingers ranks in Perform) or take 1d6

points of Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage.

A creature that is affected by a dirgesingers song of horror or

a creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be

affected by the same dirgesingers song of horror for 24 hours.

Song  of  Awakening:  At  5th  level,  a  dirgesinger  can  animate

the  recently  slain  corpse  of  a  creature  within  30  feet.  This

requires  the  dirgesinger  to  make  a  Perform  check  (DC  10  +

target creatures HD). The slain creature can have no more Hit

Dice than the dirgesingers character level. If the attempt fails,

the dirgesinger can try again in a later round. The corpse to be

awakened must have been dead for no more than 1 hour.

The awakened creatures type becomes undead, and it retains

any subtypes it had. The creature retains all class features, as well

as any supernatural or spell-like (but not extraordinary) abilities

it possessed in life (though any spells cast or daily uses expended

before the creatures death count against its normal limits). The

awakened creature is completely loyal to the dirgesinger and

obeys  any  commands  given  it  (if  no  commands  are  given,  it

simply  attacks  the  dirgesingers  foes).  The  creature  remains

animate as long as the dirgesinger continues to perform.

MASTER OF RADIANCE

Masters of radiance channel the pure, undiluted power of the

sun. Often originating in a good-aligned druid sect that reveres

the sun, they have a holy purpose to scour the earth clean of

undead. Wielding the suns radiance as a weapon, they are the

bane of any evil creature that lurks in the darkness.

Most masters of radiance are druids, due to their historical

connection to sun-worshiping sects. Clerics with the Animal or

Plant domain have Knowledge (nature) as a class skill and can

easily qualify to enter the class; such clerics often revere Pelor

or another sun deity and choose Sun as their second domain.

Some  cleric/rangers  and  even  rare  paladin/rangers  can  also

qualify for this class, bringing a combination of holy zeal and

reverence for nature to their crusade against the undead. Other

characters rarely have the combination of skills and spellcasting

to become masters of radiance.

NPC masters of radiance prefer to work proactively against

evil, seeking out the lairs of undead and other darkness-dwelling

monsters and destroying them with ruthless ef ciency. They

often cluster in druid sects to pool their efforts, and frequently

ally  themselves  with  other  religious  groups  that  share  their

outlook, such as temples of Pelor.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  master  of  radiance,  a  character  must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Skills: Knowledge (nature) 8 ranks, Knowledge

(religion) 5 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast daylight as a divine

spell.

CLASS SKILLS

The  master  of  radi-

ances  class  skills  (and  the

key  ability  for  each  skill)

are  Concentration  (Con),  Di-

plomacy  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),

Knowledge  (nature)  (Int),

Knowledge  (religion)  (Int),  Profession  (Wis),

Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class

features of the master of radi-

ance prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  -

ciency:  Masters  of  radiance

gain  no  pro ciency  with  any

weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:

Beginning  at  2nd  level,  a  master  of

radiance  gains  new  spells  per  day

(and spells known, if applicable) as

if she had also gained a level in a di-

vine spellcasting class to which she

belonged  before  adding  the  prestige

class level. She does not, however, gain

any other bene t a character of that class

would  have  gained  (metamagic  or  item

creation feats and so on; but see Turn Un-

dead, below). If she had more than

one  divine  spellcasting  class  be-

fore becoming a master of radiance,

she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose

of determining spells per day and spells known.

Branna Caersicus, a

master of radiance

Turn Undead (Su): Master of radiance class levels stack with

levels of all other classes that grant the ability to turn undead

for the purpose of determining the characters effective cleric

level for turning. See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the

Players Handbook. For example, a 7th-level cleric/5th-level master

of radiance turns undead as a 12th-level cleric.

Radiant Aura (Su): A master of radiance can emanate an

aura of brilliant light that weakens undead creatures. The aura

provides  bright  illumination  in  a  30-foot  radius  around  the

character,  and  shadowy  illumination  for  an  additional  30

feet  beyond  that.  Creatures  that  take  penalties  in  bright

light also take them while within the radius of the bright

aura. In addition, undead creatures within the radius of

bright light take a 2 penalty on attack rolls, damage

rolls, and saving throws.

Activating the radiant aura is a free action  that does

not  provoke  attacks  of  opportunity.  While

her radiant aura is active, a master of

radiance  casts  spells  with  the  light

descriptor at +2 caster level.

A  master  of  radiance  can  use  this  ability

once per day at 1st level, twice per day at 3rd

level, and three times per day at 5th level.

Each use lasts 1 minute.

The  radiant  aura  is  the  equivalent  of  a

5th-level spell with the light descriptor for

the purpose of interacting with spells and

effects with the darkness descriptor.

Searing Light (Sp): Beginning at 2nd

level, a master of radiance can use searing

light as a standard action once per round as

long as her radiant aura is active. Treat the

characters caster level for this effect

as equal to her highest divine caster

level, including the +2 caster level

adjustment  for  the  radiant  aura  (for

example,  a  7th-level  druid/2nd-level

master of radiance would use this effect

as a 10th-level spellcaster).

radiant  aura  is  active.  Treat  the

The master of shrouds is an evil spellcaster who magically seizes

incorporeal undead and sets them to do her bidding. Plucking

vile creatures such as wraiths and shadows from their restless

haunts, she summons them to her presence and commands them

to work her will. Furious at their forced servitude, the wrathful

undead spread fear and death in their wake.

Most masters of shrouds have experience as clerics. Paladins

never become masters of shrouds, though ex-paladins may do so,

particularly if they turn far enough from their lawful good roots

to become blackguards. Multiclass clerics are also common fol-

lowers of this path, including cleric/ ghters and cleric/rogues.

A small number of cleric/necromancer/mystic theurges take up

the role of master of shrouds at their highest levels.

Rebuke Undead (Su): Master of shrouds class levels stack

with levels of all other classes that grant the ability to rebuke

undead for the purpose of determining the characters effective

cleric level for rebuking. See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159

of the Players Handbook. For example, a 7th-level cleric/5th-level

master of shrouds rebukes undead as a 12th-level cleric.

Summon Undead (Sp): At 2nd level and higher, a master of

shrouds can summon one or more incorporeal undead creatures

a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modi er

(minimum 1). This ability is otherwise identical to the summon

monster spells, except that a master of shrouds adds her Charisma

modi er (if positive) to the duration of the effect.

At 2nd level, a master of shrouds can summon a single shadow.

At 4th level, she can summon one wraith or two shadows. At

6th level, she can summon one spectre, two wraiths, or four

shadows. At 8th level, she can summon one greater shadow, two

spectres, four wraiths, or four shadows. At 10th level, she can

summon one dread wraith, two greater shadows, four spectres,

four wraiths, or four shadows.

Improved  Summoning  (Ex):  Beginning  at  5th  level,  a

master of shrouds summons more powerful undead creatures

than  normal.  Whenever  she  casts  a  summon  undead  spell  or

when she uses her summon undead class ability, the summoned

creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and

damage rolls.

PALE MASTER

Necromancy is usually a poor choice

for arcane spellcastersthose who really

want to master the deathless arts almost always

pursue divine means. However, there is an al-

ternative for those who desire power over the

undead but refuse to give up their arcane

craft  completely.  Enter  the  pale

master,  who  draws  on  a  font  of

special lore that provides a maca-

bre power all its own.

Virtually all pale masters are for-

mer wizards or sorcerers, due to the

arcane talents required for entry into

the class. Some have also dabbled in

divine magic, perhaps mul-

ticlassing  as  clerics,  before

following this path.

NPC  pale  masters  head  special

strike  groups  containing  lesser

undead, supplemented as

needed  with  more  pow-

erful summoned undead. Sometimes they serve or act in

collusion with powerful evil characters, such as true necromancers

or divine spellcasters with Death as one of their domains. Wherever

pale masters go, undead follow. Often it is dif cult to tell a pale

master from the undead that he surrounds himself with.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a pale master, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skill: Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.

Feat: Skill Focus (Knowledge [religion]).

Spells: Able to cast command undead and vampiric touch as

arcane spells.

Special: The candidate must have spent three or more days

locked in a tomb with animate undead. This contact may be

peaceful or violent. A character who is slain by the undead and

later raised still meets the requirement, although the resulting

level loss may delay compliance with other prerequisites.

CLASS SKILLS

The pale masters class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Hide

(Dex), Knowledge (any) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the pale master prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Pale masters gain pro -

ciency with light and medium armor. They gain no pro ciency

with any weapons or shields.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  Beginning  at  2nd  level,

a pale master gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcast-

ing class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class

level. He does not, however, gain any other bene t a character

of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning

or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so

on). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before

becoming a pale master, he must decide to which class to add

each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Animate Dead (Sp): Starting at 2nd level, a pale master begins

to exercise control over the undead. Once per day, he can use

animate dead, as the spell, without need of a material component.

Use the pale masters highest arcane caster level as the caster level

for this effect. All other level restrictions of animate dead still

apply. For example, a 6th-level sorcerer/3rd-level pale master can

animate up to 16 HD of undead with a single use of this ability.

Likewise, he can control up to 32 HD of undead created using

this ability, the animate dead spell, or both.

Darkvision  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  the  dark  begins  to  lose  its

mysteries to a pale master, who gains darkvision out to 60 feet.

If he already has darkvision, its effective distance increases by

60 feet.

Undead Armor Af  nity (Ex): A pale master has an instinc-

tive feel for undead armor. At 4th level and higher, he treats the

undead armor as if its arcane spell failure chance were 10% less.

At 8th level, this reduction improves to 20%.

Control Undead (Sp): Once per day, a pale master of 5th

level or higher can gain control over an undead creature (with

Hit Dice equal to or less than his highest arcane caster level) by

making a successful touch attack against it. The undead creature

receives no saving throw to resist this effect. The control lasts for

1 round per class level. When the duration expires, the undead

creature  returns  to  its  former  allegiance,  if  any.  The  newly

controlled undead can still be turned or rebuked as normal.

This effect is otherwise identical to the control undead spell. This

ability is in addition to the number of undead a pale master can

control using his animate dead ability.

Deathless Vigor (Ex): Beginning at 5th level, a pale masters

body becomes more akin to the undying  esh of his undead

associates. The character gains a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves

except against effects that also work on objects.

Undead Graft (Su): At 6th level, a pale master gives in to

terrible necrophiliac urges. He cuts off his arm and replaces

it with an undead prosthetic, which may be skeletal in form

or preserved  esh stitched in place like that of a  esh golem.

Regardless of its composition, the graft grants a +4 inherent

bonus to the characters Strength score.

Additionally, the undead graft allows him to deliver horrible

touch attacks. A pale master can use this ability once per day at

6th level, twice per day at 8th level, and three times per day at

10th level. The character must declare that he is using this ability

before making the attack roll; a failed attack roll still expends

that use of the ability. Each time he makes a touch attack using

this ability, the pale master can select from any of the effects

described below for which he meets the prerequisite class level.

The save DC for the pale masters touch attacks is 10 + his pale

master class level + his Cha modi er.

Paralyzing Touch: Any living foe except for an elf that is hit by

a pale masters touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or

be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Prerequisite: Class level 6th.

Weakening  Touch:  A  living  foe  hit  by  a  pale  masters  touch

attack takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (no save). A creature

reduced to Strength 0 dies. Prerequisite: Class level 7th.

Degenerative Touch: A living foe hit by a pale masters touch

attack receives one negative level (no save), and must make a

Fortitude save 24 hours later to avoid losing the level perma-

nently. Prerequisite: Class level 8th.

Destructive  Touch:  A  living  foe  hit  by  a  pale  masters  touch

attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of

Constitution drain. Prerequisite: Class

level 9th.

Deathless Masters Touch: A liv-

ing foe of up to one size category

larger  than  a  pale  master  hit

by  the  pale  masters  touch

attack  must  succeed  on  a

Fortitude  save  or  die.  A

slain  creature  automatically

animates  1  round  later  as  a

zombie (see page 265 of the

Monster  Manual)  and  is  un-

der  the  pale  masters  control

as if he had animated it. Undead

created using this power do not

count against a pale masters HD

total for controlling undead. Pre-

requisite: Class level 10th.

Tough as Bone (Ex): On reaching

7th level, a pale master takes on even

more of the qualities of an undead crea-

ture. He becomes immune to disease,

nonlethal damage, and stunning.

Undead  Cohort:  A  9th-level  pale

master gains the service of a loyal un-

dead cohort. The cohort follows the

rules for undead cohorts described

under the Undead Leadership feat

(see page 31). The pale master does

not gain any followers from this

ability,  only  a  single  cohort.

The cohorts effective character

level is determined by the pale

masters  Leadership  score  and

character level exactly as if the

cohort had been gained by means

of the Undead Leadership feat.

Deathless Mastery (Ex): On

reaching  10th  level,  a  pale

master gains the virtues of his

deathless arts. His body becomes partly mummi ed (though he

is not truly undead), and he becomes immune to poison, sleep

effects, paralysis, death effects, critical hits, ability drain, and

energy drain, as well as damage to his physical ability scores

(Str, Dex, and Con). He still needs to breathe, eat, and sleep as

normal for his type, and he still ages normally.

Ugen Allai was outcast from his family when just on the verge of

adulthood for committing sacrilege and raising a family member

from the dead. Since that time, hes wandered, seeking more

SACRED

PURIFIER

Sacred  puri ers  are  priestly

characters  who  specialize

in  destroying  undead.  They

belong  to  a  loose-knit  order  af liated

with  the  church  of  Pelor  (or  another  similar  faith),  though

they  disdain  hierarchical  bureaucracy  in  favor  of  action  and

forthrightness. Many pursue an act  rst, ask questions later

approach, which occasionally frustrates the more traditional-

minded clerics in the churchs chain of command.

Most sacred puri ers are clerics (often of Pelor), but paladins

have also been known to take up the call. Fighter/clerics also

make good sacred puri ers, as do barbarian/clerics (who appreci-

ate the orders forthright nature).

NPC  sacred  puri ers  may  work  alone  or  in  groups,  either

with other puri ers, with devotees of Pelor, or with any who

share their goals.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class

features  of  the  sacred  puri er

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Profi-

ciency:  Sacred puri ers gain no

pro ciency with any weapons, ar-

mor, or shields.

Spells per Day/Spells Known:

Beginning at 2nd level, a sacred puri er gains

new spells per day (and spells known, if ap-

plicable) as if he had also gained a level in a

divine spellcasting class to which he be-

longed  before  adding  the  prestige  class

level. He does not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have

gained (metamagic or item creation feats

and so on; but see Turn Undead, below). If

he had more than one divine spellcasting

class before becoming a sacred puri er, he

must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day

and spells known.

Greater Turning (Su): Once per day,

a sacred puri er can perform a greater

turning against an undead in place of

a regular turning. The greater turning

is like a normal turning, except that

the undead creatures that would

be  turned  are   destroyed

instead.

If the character already

has this ability (such as

from the Sun domain), he can use it one additional time per

day.

Turn Undead (Su): Sacred puri er class levels stack with

levels of all other classes that grant the ability to turn undead

for the purpose of determining the characters effective cleric

level for turning. See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the

Players Handbook. For example, a 7th-level cleric/5th-level sacred

puri er turns undead as a 12th-level cleric.

Sacred Strike (Su): Whenever a sacred puri er of 3rd level

or higher successfully strikes an undead creature in melee, he

can spend a turning attempt as a free action to deal an extra 2d6

points of damage with that attack. He can deliver such sacred

strikes any number of times per round, but no more than once

per attack. If the sacred puri er accidentally attempts a sacred

strike against a nonundead creature, the turning attempt

is lost with no effect.

Positive  Energy  Burst  (Su):  As  a  full-round

action,  a  5th-level  sacred  puri er  can  spend  two

turning  attempts  to  create  a  positive  energy  burst.

This energy deals 10d6 points of damage to all undead

creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst centered on

the sacred puri er. A successful Re ex save (DC 10

+ sacred puri ers class level + sacred puri ers Cha

modi er) halves this damage.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a true necromancer, a character must ful ll

all of the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills:  Knowledge  (arcana)  8  ranks,  Knowledge  (religion)

8 ranks.

CLASS SKILLS

TRUE NECROMANCER

Power corrupts. Power over life and death corrupts absolutely.

The power to raise an undying servant from the husk of the

formerly living is darkly temptingand certainly evil. Those

who seek such unyielding obedience from the dead willingly

tread the path of necromancy.

Characters who wish to become true necromancers must take

levels in both arcane and divine spellcasting classes, usually

cleric and wizard or cleric and sorcerer. Only then do they begin

their sinister schooling, learning how to combine the foulest

aspects of both disciplines into a single, necromantic whole.

NPC  true  necromancers  are  usually  found  singlyliving

in an abandoned graveyard, hidden in the depths of a centu-

ries-old  catacomb,  or  lurking  in  an  unhallowed  mausoleum.

Occasionally, true necromancers gather into small societies or

evil associations, but eventually most such groups are stamped

out. At least, so hope those concerned with the triumph of good

over evil in the world.

Hit Die: d6.

The true necromancers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), Knowl-

edge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis),

Search (Int), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the true necromancer

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: True necromancers gain

no pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: A true necromancer gains

new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she

had also gained a level in either an arcane spellcasting class

she belonged to before adding the prestige class, a divine spell-

casting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class,

or both, according to the accompanying table. She does not,

Horrid Wilting (Sp): At 10th level and higher, a true necro-

mancer can use horrid wilting once per day, with a caster level

equal to her character level plus her bonus from the necromantic

prowess ability.

Energy Drain (Sp): At 13th level and higher, a true necro-

mancer can use energy drain once per day, with a caster level

equal to her character level plus her bonus from the necromantic

prowess ability.

Wail of the Banshee (Sp): At 14th level, a true necromancer

can use wail of the banshee once per day, with a caster level equal

to  her  character  level  plus  her  bonus  from  the  necromantic

prowess ability.

SAMPLE TRUE NECROMANCER

As a disciple of Nerull, Thredra Aranax has studied both divine

and arcane magic to better perfect her mastery over undead.

Thredra Aranax,

a true necromancer

had more than one arcane or divine spellcasting class before

becoming a true necromancer, she must decide to which class

she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Rebuke Undead (Su): True necromancer class levels stack

with levels of all other classes that grant the ability to rebuke

undead for the purpose of determining the characters effective

cleric level for rebuking. See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159

of the Players Handbook. For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rd-level

sorcerer/2nd-level true necromancer rebukes undead as a 7th-

level cleric. The bonus from her necromantic prowess ability,

once it is gained, also applies.

Create Undead (Sp): On attaining 2nd level, a true necro-

mancer can cast create undead once per day, as the spell of the

same  name.  She  can  use  this  ability  one  additional  time  per

day at 5th level and higher. She must still supply the requisite

material components. The true necromancers caster level equals

her character level plus the bonus from her nec-

romantic prowess ability, once it is gained.

Necromantic  Prowess  (Ex):  At  3rd

level,  a  true  necromancer  gains  un-

surpassed power over death. When

she rebukes undead, casts a necro-

mancy  spell,  or  uses  a  spell-like

ability that mimics a necromancy

spell,  her  effective  caster  level  in-

creases. The bonus is +1 at 3rd level,

+2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and

+4 at 12th level and higher.

Zone of Desecration (Su): At 4th

level, a true necromancer begins to exert

her authority over undead. This aura is

identical  to  the  effects  of  the  desecrate

spell (see page 218 of the Players Hand-

book)  except  that  it  affects  only  allied

undead.

Major Desecration (Su): At 7th

level, a true necromancer extends

her  authority  over  undead.  The

supernatural  aura  of  negative

energy  surrounding  her  (see

Zone  of  Desecration,  above)

now  extends  to  a  radius  of  10

feet per true necromancer class

level.

Create  Greater  Undead

(Sp):  On  reaching  8th  level,

a  true  necromancer  can  cast

create greater undead (see page

215  of  the  Players  Handbook)

once  per  day,  as  the  spell.

She  can  use  this  ability  one

additional  time  per  day  at

11th  level  and  higher.  She

must  still  supply  the  requi-

site material component. The

true necromancers caster level

equals her character level plus

the bonus from her necromantic

prowess ability.

EPHEMERAL EXEMPLAR

Ephemeral  exemplars  are  paragons  of  incorporealness.  They

gain greater resistance to attacks and turning, and eventually

gain the ability to manipulate solid objects as easily as corporeal

beings can.

Most  ephemeral  exemplars  are  ghosts,  spectres,  or  dread

wraiths. Some advanced allips, shadows, and wraiths can also

qualify for this class.

NPC ephemeral exemplars often serve as leaders of weaker

undead creatures, particularly those it can spawn. They typically

lair in dark, haunted places, waiting for unsuspecting victims

to pass by.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify to become an ephemeral exemplar, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Type: Undead (incorporeal subtype).

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

Base Save Bonus: Will +5.

Class Skills

The ephemeral exemplars class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

gain no pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Improved De  ection (Su): An ephemeral exemplar adds

its class level to its de ection bonus to AC.

exemplar of 2nd level or higher gains a +4 enhancement bonus

to its Dexterity score. If the exemplar is destroyed, the spawn

Ghostly Grasp (see page 27) as a bonus feat, even if it doesnt

meet the prerequisite.

UNDEAD PRESTIGE CLASSES

This  section  presents  prestige  classes  designed  for  undead

creatures. Even undead creatures that normally dont advance

by class level, such as mummies, wights, or spectres, may take

these prestige classes. If an undead creature has no advancement

(such as a skeleton or zombie), it cannot take levels in one of

these prestige classes.

Sample Ephemeral Exemplar

Lalruun is a dangerous spectre that has been dead so long that it

no longer remembers its living existence or even its full name.

The creature hates the living, and attempts to destroy any who

enter its lair.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by Lalruun becomes

a spectre in 1d4 rounds. Lalruuns spawn are under its command

and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of

the abilities they had in life. Any spawn created Lalruun gains

a +4 enhancement bonus to its Dexterity score.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by Lalruuns incor-

poreal touch attack gain two negative levels. The DC is 18 for the

Fortitude save to remove a negative level. For each such negative

level bestowed, Lalruun gains 5 temporary hit points that last

for up to 1 hour.

Incorporeal Traits: Lalruun has no physical body and can

be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons

or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like

abilities,  or  supernatural  abilities.  (For  a  full  description  of

incorporeal traits, see page 140.)

Sunlight  Powerlessness  (Ex):  Lalruun  is  powerless  in

natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and  ees from it.

If caught in sunlight, Lalruun cannot attack and can take only

a single move action or attack action in a round.

Undead Traits: Lalruun is immune to mind-affecting spells

and abilities, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not

subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain,

fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot

be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

Unnatural Aura (Su): Animals, whether wild or domesti-

cated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance

of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and

become panicked if forced to do so; they remain panicked as

long as they are within that range.

Possessions: +1 ghost touch spiked chain.

Requirements

To qualify to become a lurking terror, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Type: Undead.

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks.

Special: If the character possesses the incorporeal subtype,

it need not meet the Move Silently requirement.

Class Skills

The lurking terrors class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Listen

(Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  lurking  terror

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Lurking terrors gain no

pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Deathly Power (Ex): A lurking terror adds its class level to any

save DCs for the extraordinary and supernatural special attacks

possessed by an undead creature of its kind. This ability has no

effect on the lurking terrors spells or spell-like abilities, nor

on any special abilities gained from its nonundead kind (such

as a vampiric medusas petrifying gaze), feats, or class features

(such as the assassins death attack).

For example, a vampire that becomes a 1st-level lurking terror

increases the DC of its dominate and energy drain special attacks

by 1. If the vampire were also a sorcerer with the Stunning Fist

feat, neither its spell save DCs nor the save DC for its stunning

attacks would be affected.

Improved  Darkvision  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  the  effective

distance  of  a  lurking  terrors  darkvision  improves  to  90  feet.

(If the lurking terror doesnt already have darkvision, it gains

darkvision out to 60 feet.)

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): At 3rd level, a lurking terror can

use the Hide skill even while being observed, as long as it has

cover or concealment.

LURKING TERROR

Most people fear things that goes bump in the night. Lurking

terrors  give  greater  reason  to  fear  things  that  cant  be  heard.

These horrible monsters are the quintessential hunting undead,

displaying great prowess with their special abilities and amazing

powers of stealth.

Any undead creature with a modicum of stealth can become

a lurking terror. Mohrgs, nightshades, vampires, wraiths, dread

wraiths, and advanced ghasts commonly enter this prestige class.

NPC lurking terrors are more active than traditional undead,

seeking out living prey rather than waiting for it to come to

them. They can be found anywhere that darkness exists.

Hit Die: d12.

Sample Lurking Terror

Years ago, the small village of Balcress was haunted by a merci-

less killer. The village lies deserted, but the killer, a powerful

mohrg with levels in the lurking terror prestige class, lingers

there still.

Create Spawn (Su): Creatures killed by the Balcress horror

rise after 1d4 days as zombies under its control. They do not

possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): The Balcress horror can use the

Hide skill even while being observed, as long as it has cover or

concealment.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the Balcress horror

must hit a creature of its size or smaller with its slam attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity.

Paralyzing Touch (Su): The Balcress horror lashes out with

its tongue in combat. An opponent the tongue touches must

succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4

minutes.

Undead  Traits:  The  Balcress  horror  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting  abilities,  poison,  magic  sleep  effects,  paralysis,

stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is

not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain,

fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot

be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

MASTER VAMPIRE

Any vampire can create spawn, but it takes a very special vampire

to rule over an entire gang of minions. The master vampire uses

its force of personality to control more spawn than any normal

vampire could hope to rule.

As the name suggests, the master vampire must be a vampire,

but  the  class  of  the  master  vampire  can  vary  greatly.  Master

vampires are most common among charismatic character classes,

including sorcerer, blackguard, rogue, and bard.

An NPC master vampire invariably rules a gang, tribe, or clan

of lesser vampires and vampire spawn. It uses these minions as

soldiers, guardians, or gatherers, depending on its goals.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify to become a master vampire, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Special:  The  character  must  be  a  vampire  (not  a  vampire

spawn).

Special: The character must control at least two vampires or

vampire spawn that it has created by means of its create spawn

ability.

Class Skills

The  master  vampires  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Cha),

Diplomacy (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis),

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  master  vampire

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Master vampires gain no

pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each odd-numbered level,

a master vampire gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if it had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to

which it belonged before adding the prestige class level. It does

not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that class would

have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead,

metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the creature had

more  than  one  spellcasting  class  before  becoming  a  master

vampire, it must decide to which class to add each level for the

purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

More  Spawn  (Su):  A  master  vampire  adds  its  Charisma

modi er to its Hit Dice to determine how many spawn it can

have enslaved. For example, a master vampire with 10 HD and

a Charisma of 18 is treated as having 14 HD for the purpose of

determining its limit of controlled spawn, and therefore can

enslave up to 28 HD of spawned vampires.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A master vampires turn resistance is

increased by 1 for each of its spawn within 60 feet.

Enhanced  Spawn  (Su):  Any  vampire  or  vampire  spawn

created by a master vampire of 2nd level or higher gains a +2

enhancement bonus to its Strength and Dexterity scores. If the

master vampire is destroyed or releases the spawn from service,

the spawn loses this bonus.

Masters Chosen (Su): At 3rd level, a master vampire can des-

ignate a single vampire or a vampire spawn that it created with

its create spawn ability as its chosen. Doing this requires a 1-hour

ritual during which the chosen must consume a small portion

of the masters  esh. The chosen gains a +6 enhancement bonus

to its Strength and Dexterity scores. The master can remove this

designation as a standard action. If the master vampire is destroyed

or releases the chosen from service, the chosen loses this bonus.

Sample Master Vampire

Ruler of a shattered barony, Laudric has  lled her ancestral home

with undead minions in a parody of her living existence.

Improved InitiativeB, Improved Natural Attack (slam), Improved

Turning, Lightning Re exesB, Spell Penetration, Greater Spell

Penetration.

Alternate Form (Su): Laudric can assume the shape of a bat,

dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is

similar to a polymorph spell cast by a 12th-level character, except

that Laudric does not regain hit points for changing form and

must  choose  from  among  the  forms  mentioned  here.  While

in  her  alternate  form,  Laudric  loses  her  natural  slam  attack

and dominate ability, but she gains the natural weapons and

extraordinary special attacks of her new form. She can remain in

that form until she assumes another or until the next sunrise.

Blood  Drain  (Ex):  Laudric  can  suck  blood  from  a  living

victim with her fangs by making a successful grapple check.

If  she  pins  the  foe,  she  drains  blood,  dealing  1d4  points  of

Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each

such  successful  attack,  Laudric  gains  5  temporary  hit  points

that last for up to 1 hour.

Children of the Night (Su): Laudric commands the lesser

creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat

swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard

action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve Laudric

for up to 1 hour.

in uence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th).

TOMB WARDEN

Tomb wardens serve as sel ess, undying protectors of the dead.

Each one dedicates itself to the eternal guardianship of a tomb,

graveyard,  or  similar  repository  of  the  dead,  and  gains  great

powers while within that area.

Most tomb wardens are mummies, because the role comes

naturally to them. Advanced wights may become tomb wardens,

and some privacy-seeking liches also take up this mantle. On rare

occasions, a ghost might be doomed to protect a crypt or grave-

yard, and might become a tomb warden as part of its service.

NPC tomb wardens are always solitary, private individuals.

They have little use for companions, though some keep minions

nearby for additional assistance in their appointed task.

To qualify to become a tomb warden, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Type: Undead.

Alignment: Any nonchaotic.

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

Base Save Bonus: Will +5.

Feat: Toughness.

Special: A tomb warden must dedicate itself to the protection

of a tomb, graveyard, or similar resting place of the dead.

Class Skills

The  tomb  wardens  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill) are Hide (Dex), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis),

Move  Silently  (Dex),  Search  (Int),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  and

Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  tomb  warden

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Tomb  wardens  gain

pro ciency with simple and martial weapons, and with light,

medium, and heavy armor.

Turn Immunity (Ex): As long as it is within the tomb, grave-

yard, or similar resting place that it protects, a tomb warden is

immune to turning or rebuking attempts. It can still be bolstered

as normal.

Tomb Sense (Su): While it is within the tomb, graveyard, or

similar resting place it protects, a tomb warden of 2nd level or

higher automatically knows the precise location of all intruders

within that tomb. This ability is similar to blindsense, except

that it functions without regard to line of effect and its effect

extends to every portion of the tomb.

Power of the Dead (Su): While it is within the tomb, graveyard,

or similar resting place it protects, a 3rd-level tomb warden can call

upon the spirits of the dead to gain insight from them. This ability

requires only a free action to activate, and grants the tomb warden

an insight bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws

equal to its Charisma modi er (minimum +1). A tomb warden can

use this ability once per day, and its effects last for 10 minutes.

Sample Tomb Warden

Once a loyal guard to an ancient line of kings, Argotem was

cursed  to  undeath  for  failing  in  his  duties.  He  now  stands  a

ceaseless vigil a sacred treasure known as the amber  re.

Skills and Feats: Hide +7, Listen +11, Move Silently +7, Spot

+11; Alertness, Great Fortitude, Power Attack, Toughness.

Despair (Su): At the mere sight of Argotem, a viewer must

succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4

rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot

be affected again by Argotems despair ability for 24 hours.

Mummy Rot (Su): Supernatural diseaseslam, Fortitude DC

16, incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha.

Unlike  normal  diseases,  mummy  rot  persists  until  the  victim

reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below.

Mummy  rot  is  a  powerful  curse,  not  a  natural  disease.  A

character  attempting  to  cast  any  conjuration  (healing)  spell

on a creature af icted with mummy rot must succeed on a DC

20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the af icted

character.

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must  rst be broken with

break enchantment or remove curse (requiring a DC 20 caster level

check for either spell), after which a caster level check is no

longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the

mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease.

An af icted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into

sand and dust that blow away into nothing at the  rst wind.

Power of the Dead (Su): While within the tomb he protects,

Argotem can call upon the spirits of the dead to gain insight

from them. This ability requires only a free action to activate

and grants Argotem a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls, damage

rolls, and saving throws. Argotem may use this ability once per

day, and its effects last for 10 minutes.

Tomb  Sense  (Su):  While  within  the  tomb  he  protects,

Argotem automatically knows the precise location of all intrud-

ers within that tomb. This ability is similar to blindsense, except

that it functions without regard to line of effect and its effect

extends to every portion of the tomb.

Turn Immunity (Ex): As long as he is within the tomb that

he protects, Argotem is immune to turning or rebuking. He can

still be bolstered as normal.

Undead Traits: Argotem is immune to mind-affecting spells

and abilities, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. He is not

subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

damage to his physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain,

fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. He cannot

be raised, and resurrection works only if he is willing.

Vulnerability to Fire (Ex): Argotem takes half again as much

If a tomb warden leaves the tomb it protects for longer than seven

days, or if it relinquishes guardianship of the tomb, it loses all

(+50%) damage as normal from  re attacks.

Possessions: +1 full plate.

Presentation on page 181 of the Players

Handbook.

AVASCULAR MASS

Necromancy [Death, Evil]

Level: Deathbound 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Ray

Duration: See text

Saving  Throw:  Fortitude  partial  and

Re ex negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You shoot a ray of necromantic energy

from  your  outstretched  hand,  causing

any living creature struck by the ray to

violently purge blood vessels through its

skin. You must succeed on a ranged touch

attack to touch the subject. If the touch

attack  is  successful,  the  subject  loses

half  its  hit  points  (rounded  down)  and

is stunned for 1 round. On a successful

Fortitude  saving  throw,  the  subject  is

not stunned.

The purged blood vessels are magically

animate,  creating  a  many-layered  mass

of magically strong, adhesive tissue that

trap those caught in them. The avascu-

lar  mass  instantaneously  erupts  from

the  target,  and  must  be  anchored  on

last least two opposed pointssuch as

 oor and ceiling or opposite wallsor

else the mass collapses and has no effect.

Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius

avascular  mass  become  entangled.  The

original  target  of  the  spell  is  automati-

cally entangled.

An  entangled  creature  takes  a  2

penalty on attack rolls, a 4 penalty to

effective Dexterity, and cant move. An

entangled character who attempts to cast

a spell must make a Concentration check

or lose the spell. Because the avascular

mass is magically animate, and gradually

tightens on those it holds, the Concentra-

tion check DC is 30.

Anyone within 20 feet of the primary

target when the spell is cast must make

a Re ex save. If this save succeeds, the

creature is not stuck in the avascular mass

and is free to act, though moving may be

a problem (see below). If the save fails, the

creature  is  stuck.  A  stuck  creature  can

break  loose  by  spending  1  round  and

succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check

or  a  DC  30  Escape  Artist  check.  Once

loose  (either  from  making  the  initial

Re ex  save  or  a  later  Strength  check

or Escape Artist check), a creature may

progress  through  the  writhing  blood

vessels very slowly. Each round devoted

to moving allows the creature to make

a new Strength check or Escape Artist

check. The creature moves 5 feet for each

full 5 points by which the check result

exceeds 10.

If you have at least 5 feet of avascular

mass  between  you  and  an  opponent,  it

provides  cover.  If  you  have  at  least  20

feet  of  avascular  mass  between  you,  it

provides total cover.

When the secondary duration elapses,

the blood vessel mass becomes only so

much limp, decaying tissue.

AVASCULATE

Necromancy [Death, Evil]

Level: Deathbound 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Ray

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You shoot a ray of necromantic energy

from  your  outstretched  hand,  causing

any living creature struck by the ray to

violently purge blood or other vital  uids

through its skin. You must succeed on a

ranged touch attack to affect the subject.

If  successful,  the  subject  is  reduced  to

half  of  its  current  hit  points  (rounded

down)  and  stunned  for  1  round.  On  a

successful  Fortitude  saving  throw,  the

subject is not stunned.

AWAKEN UNDEAD

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Deathbound 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: M, S, V, XP

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: All mindless undead within a

circle 25 ft. in radius + 5 ft./2 levels

Duration: Permanent (D)

Saving Throw: None (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell grants intelligence to mindless

undead such as skeletons and zombies.

Undead  with  Intelligence  scores  are

unaffected.  Mindless  undead  within

the  radius  gain  Intelligence  4+1d6.

Undead  cannot  gain  more  intelligence

than  typical  of  their  original  kind.  A

skeletal  dog  simply  has  Intelligence  2,

while  a  skeletal  orc  makes  the  die  roll

but cant have more than Intelligence 8.

Undead do not regain any skills or feats

they had in life.

Undead regain the armor and weapon

pro ciencies  they  had  in  life  (assume

the  undead  were  formerly  warriors

unless  your  DM  speci es  otherwise)

and will don armor and take up weap-

ons while obeying your commands. A

zombie  ghter can wear any armor and

wield  any  simple  or  martial  weapon,

while a zombie warhorse can wear any

armor.

Undead also regain any extraordinary

abilities they had in life, such as poison

or scent.

Awakened undead gain a +2 profane

bonus  on  their  Will  saving  throws  to

resist control undead. Awakened undead

also  gain  +2  turn  resistance  (or  retain

their own turn resistance, if any, and if

it is better than +2).

Components: V

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

On your successful melee touch attack,

a  target  that  fails  its  saving  throw  is

subject  to  being  swallowed  whole.  To

the observer, it appears as if your maw

suddenly opens many times its normal

size, after which the victim is engulfed.

Your  maw  immediately  returns  to  its

natural size.

Of  the  victim,  there  is  no  visible

signthe swallowed subject exists in in

a temporary stomach dimension. The

swallowed  victim  takes  2d8+12  points

of  bludgeoning  damage  plus  12  points

of acid damage per round while in the

stomach dimension. A swallowed crea-

slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35

points of damage to the stomach dimen-

sion (AC 21). A creature that successfully

exits appears to cut its way free

from  thin  air,  appearing  in  a

space adjacent to the caster.

Each time you cast this spell,

you  create  a  separate  temporary

stomach dimension.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One humanoid

Duration: Concentration

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

until the spells duration expires.

Additionally, your effective caster level

goes  up  by  1  per  death  caused  by  this

spell,  to  a  maximum  of  1/2  your  origi-

nal caster level, improving spell effects

that are dependent on caster level. (This

increase in effective caster level does not

grant you access to more spells.)

Creatures that fall to 1 hit points or

lower in the area after the spell is cast are

likewise subject to its effect.

No  creature  can  be  affected  by  this

spell more than once per casting, regard-

an extended period.

You  point  your   nger  and  utter  the

incantation, releasing a black needle of

crackling negative energy that suppresses

the  life  force  of  any  living  creature  it

strikes. You must make a ranged touch

attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the

subject initially gains one negative level,

then continues to gain another negative

level  each  round  thereafter  as  her  life

force slowly bleeds away. The drain can

(400 feet per minute) if viewing an area

ahead as a human would (primarily look-

ing at the  oor) or 10 feet per round (100

e sain, the King of the Ghouls.

The bats, called eyes of the king, send

you visual information. You can summon

the eyes of the king at any point you can see,

but they can then travel outside your line

of sight without hindrance. Even while

outside  your  line  of  sight,  they  follow

your  mental  directions  on  where  to

explore. The eyes of the king travel together,

never separating by more than 40 feet.

Eyes of the king travel at 40 feet per round

FIELD OF GHOULS

Necromancy [Death, Evil]

Level: Hunger 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Targets:  30-ft.-radius  spherical  emana-

tion, centered on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  transform  the  ebbing  life  force  of

all nearby badly wounded creatures and

use it to create ghouls. Upon casting this

spell,  you  radiate  a  necroconsumptive

death   eld.  All  creatures  in  the  area

with  fewer  than  0  hit  points  that  fail

their saving throws die, and immediately

rise as ghouls under your control. The

ghouls follow you, or can remain where

formed and attack any creature (or just

a  speci c  kind  of  creature)  the  ghoul

notices.  The  ghouls  remain  until  they

are destroyed.

The  ghouls  that  you  create  remain

under  your  control  inde nitely.  No

matter how many ghouls you generate

with this spell, however, you can control

only  2  HD  worth  of  undead  creatures

per  caster  level  (this  includes  undead

from all sources under your control). If

you exceed this number, all the newly

created creatures fall under your control,

and  any  excess  undead  from  previous

castings  become  uncontrolled  (you

choose which creatures are released). If

you are a cleric, any undead you might

command  by  virtue  of  your  power  to

command  or  rebuke  undead  do  not

count toward the limit.

Creatures that fall to 1 hit points or

fewer in the area after the spell is cast are

likewise subject to its effect.

No  creature  can  be  affected  by  this

spell more than once per round, regard-

less of the number of times that the area

of the spell passes over them.

GHOST TOUCH

WEAPON

Level: Cleric 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One weapon or  fty projectiles

(all of which must be in contact with

each other at the time of casting)

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless,

object)

Spell  Resistance:  Yes  (harmless,

object)

Ghost  touch  weapon  makes  a  weapon

magically  capable  of  dealing  damage

normally  to  incorporeal  creatures,

regardless  of  its  enhancement  bonus.

(An  incorporeal  creatures  50%  chance

to avoid damage does not apply to attacks

made with weapons under the effect of

this spell.) A ranged weapon affected by

this spell does not bestow the ability on

its ammunition.

The  weapon  can  be  picked  up  and

moved by an incorporeal creature at any

time. A manifesting ghost can wield the

weapon  against  corporeal  foes.  Essen-

tially,  a  weapon  under  the  effect  of

this  spell  counts  as  either  corporeal  or

incorporeal at any given time, whichever

is more bene cial to the wielder.

GHOST TRAP

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 min./level (D)

You are surrounded by a  eld of energy

that negates incorporealness. The radius

of the  eld is 5 feet per caster level. All

incorporeal creatures in this  eld become

corporeal. Creatures cannot turn ethereal

while in this area, and ethereal creatures

cannot become nonethereal while in this

 eld.

GHOSTFORM

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

You assume a visible, incorporeal form

like that of a manifesting ghost. You have

no physical body while in this state. You

can be harmed only by other incorporeal

creatures,  magic  weapons  or  creatures

that strike as magic weapons, and spells,

spell-like abilities, or supernatural abili-

ties. You are immune to all nonmagical

attack forms. Even when hit by spells or

magic weapons, you have a 50% chance

to ignore any damage from a corporeal

source (except for positive energy, nega-

tive  energy,  force  effects  such  as  magic

missile, or attacks made with ghost touch

weapons).  Nondamaging  spell  effects

affect you normally unless they require

corporeal  targets  to  function  (such  as

implosion)  or  they  create  a  corporeal

effect that incorporeal creatures would

normally be unaffected by (such as a web

or wall of stone spell).

As  an  incorporeal  creature,  you

have no natural armor bonus but have

a  de ection  bonus  equal  to  your  Cha-

risma bonus (always at least +1, even if

your Charisma score does not normally

provide a bonus).

You  can  enter  or  pass  through  solid

objects while in ghostform, but you must

remain adjacent to the objects exterior,

and  so  cannot  pass  entirely  through

an  object  whose  space  is  larger  than

your  own.  You  can  sense  the  presence

of  creatures  or  objects  within  a  square

adjacent  to  your  current  location,  but

enemies  have  total  concealment  (50%

miss  chance)  from  you  while  you  are

inside an object. In order to see farther

from  the  object  you  are  in  and  attack

normally, you must emerge. While inside

an object, you have total cover, but when

you attack a creature outside the object

you have cover only, so a creature outside

with a readied action could strike at you

as you attack. You cannot pass through a

force effect.

While under the effect of ghostform,

your attacks pass through (ignore) natu-

ral armor, armor, and shields, although

de ection  bonuses  and  force  effects

(such  as  mage  armor)  work  normally

against  you.  Your  nonmagical  attacks

have  no  effect  on  corporeal  targets,

and any attack you make with a magic

weapon against a corporeal target has a

50% miss chance, except for attacks you

make with a ghost touch weapon, while

are  made  normally  (no  miss  chance).

Spells you cast while in ghostform affect

corporeal  targets  normally,  including

spells  that  require  you  to  make  an

attack roll (such as rays or melee touch

spells). You can pass through and operate

in water as easily as you do in air. You

cannot fall or take falling damage. You

cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor

can you be tripped or grappled. In fact,

you cannot take any physical action that

would move or manipulate an opponent

or its equipment, nor are you subject to

such actions. You have no weight while

in ghostform and do not set off traps that

are triggered by weight.

You move silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if you dont wish to be

while in ghostform. You have no Strength

GHOUL GAUNTLET

Necromancy [Death, Evil]

Level: Hunger 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your touch gradually transforms a living

victim into a ravening,  esh-eating ghoul.

The transformation process begins at the

limb or extremity (usually the hand or

arm)  touched.  The  victim  takes  3d6

points  of  damage  per  round  while  the

body slowly dies as it is transformed into

a ghouls cold, undying  esh. When the

victim reaches 0 hit points, she becomes

a ghoul, body and mind.

If  the  victim  fails  her  initial  saving

throw, cure disease, dispel magic, heal, limited

wish, miracle, Mordenkainens disjunction,

remove  curse,  wish,  or  greater  restoration

negates  the  gradual  change.  Healing

spells  may  temporarily  prolong  the

process  by  increasing  the  victims  hit

points, but the transformation continues

unabated.

The  ghoul  that  you  create  remains

under  your  control  inde nitely.  No

matter how many ghouls you generate

with this spell, however, you can control

only 2 HD worth of undead creatures per

caster level (this includes undead from

all sources under your control). If you

exceed this number, all the newly created

creatures  fall  under  your  control,  and

any  excess  undead  from  previous  cast-

ings become uncontrolled (you choose

which creatures are released). If you are

a cleric, any undead you might command

by virtue of your power to command or

rebuke undead do not count toward the

limit.

GHOUL GESTURE

Necromancy

Level: Hunger 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

66

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Ray

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

A  green  ray  stabs  from  your  pointing

 nger.  You  must  succeed  on  a  ranged

touch  attack  with  the  ray  to  affect  a

target. A subject that is successfully tar-

geted must make a Fortitude save or be

paralyzed for the duration of the spell.

A subject of the ray that succeeds on

its Fortitude save is instead sickened. A

neutralize poison spell removes the effect

from a sickened creature, and creatures

immune to poison are unaffected by the

stench.

Material Component: A small scrap of

cloth  taken  from  clothing  worn  by  a

ghoul, or a pinch of earth from a ghouls

lair.

GHOUL GLYPH

Necromancy

Level: Hunger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Effect:  One  ghoul  glyph  that  must   t

within a 1-ft. square

Duration: Permanent until discharged

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You inscribe a glyph that paralyzes any

living creature of Large or smaller size

that enters, passes, or opens the warded

area.  You  can  scribe  the  glyph  to  be

visible as faintly glowing lines, or invis-

ible. You can inscribe a ghoul glyph on a

portable object, but if the object is moved

more than 5 feet, the glyph fades.

Conditions  for  triggering  a  ghoul

glyph  are  stringent.  It  takes  effect  on

any creature except yourself that moves

to or within 2 feet of it. It affects invisible

creatures normally but is not triggered by

those that travel past it ethereally. Only

a single ghoul glyph can be inscribed in a

5-foot square.

Ghoul  glyphs  cannot  be  affected  or

bypassed by such means as physical or

magical  probing,  though  they  can  be

dispelled.  Mislead  and  nondetection  can

fool a ghoul glyph.

Read  magic  allows  identi cation  of

a ghoul  glyph  with  a  successful  DC  13

Spellcraft check, if the glyph is noticed

before it is activated. A rogue (only) can

use the Search skill to  nd a ghoul glyph

and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC

in each case is 27.

When a glyph is activated, the subject

is paralyzed for 1d6+2 rounds. Addition-

ally,  if  the  subject  fails  his  Fortitude

save,  the  paralyzed  subject  exudes  a

carrion stench that causes retching and

nausea in a 10-foot radius. Those in the

radius must make a Fortitude save or take

a 2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon

damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks,

and ability checks until the spell ends.

Material  Component:  You  trace  the

glyph with earth from a ghouls lair.

GHOUL LIGHT

Necromancy

Level: Hunger 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Object touched

Effect: Magical, heatless green  ame

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

A  sickly  green   ame,  equivalent  in

brightness  to  a  torch,  springs  forth

from  an  object  that  you  touch.  The

effect looks like a regular  ame, except

for its green hue, but it creates no heat

and doesnt use oxygen. Ghoul light can be

covered and hidden, but not smothered

or quenched.

All undead within 30 feet of a source

of ghoul light gain +1 turn resistance. Mul-

tiple ghoul light sources do not stack.

Darkness spells of 2nd level or lower

can counter ghoul light.

Material Component: A bit of rendered

fat.

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Haunt  shift  translates  corporeal  and

incorporeal undead into haunting pres-

ences (see page 6). The spell converts 1d4

with  the  fewest  HD  are  affected   rst;

among creatures with equal HD, those

that  are  closest  to  the  bursts  point  of

origin are affected  rst. No creature of

9 or more HD can be affected, and Hit

Dice  that  are  not  suf cient  to  affect  a

creature are wasted.

The  undead  affected  by  this  spell  gain

a  +1  de ection  bonus  to  Armor  Class,

+1d8 bonus hit points, a +1 enhancement

bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus to

turn resistance. Each of these enhance-

ments doubles for every  ve caster levels,

so that a 20th-level caster grants undead

+4 to AC, +4d8 bonus hit points, +4 on

attack rolls and +8 to turn resistance.

INCORPOREAL NOVA

Necromancy [Death]

Level: Cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: Incorporeal or gaseous creatures

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates

A  nova  of  dissolution  dissipates  the

immaterial  bodies  of  incorporeal  and

gaseous  creatures,  destroying  them

instantly.

The  spell  destroys  1d4  HD  worth  of

creatures  per  caster  level  (maximum

20d4).  Usually,  creatures  such  as  shad-

ows, wraiths, spectres, ghosts, and similar

creatures are destroyed, though vampires

and living creatures in gaseous form are

also affected, as well as other incorporeal

creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD

are affected  rst; among creatures with

against  an  undead  of  your  Hit  Dice

requires  you  to  make  a  Will  saving

throw (DC 10 + clerics Cha modi er) or

be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds.

A turn attempt that would destroy (or

command)  undead  of  your  Hit  Dice

requires  you  to  make  a  Will  save  (DC

15 + clerics Cha modi er) or be stunned

(or charmed as by charm monster) for 10

rounds.

Any charm effect you create with this

spell  ends  when  the  spell  ends,  but  all

other effects remain until their normal

duration expires.

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target:  Living  creature  with  necrotic

cyst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  cause  the  cyst  of  a  subject  already

harboring  a  necrotic  cyst  (see  spell  of

the same name) to pulse and swell. This

agitation of the necrotic cyst tears living

tissue and expands the size of the cyst,

dealing massive internal damage to the

subject.  The  subject  takes  1d6  points

of  damage  per  level  (maximum  10d6),

and half the damage is considered vile

damage (introduced in Book of Vile Dark-

ness) because the cyst expands to envelop

the newly necrotized tissue. The cyst is

reduced  to  its  original  size  when  the

vile damage is healed. Vile damage can

only be healed by magic cast within the

area of a consecrate or hallow spell (or an

area naturally consecrated or hallowed).

Points of vile damage represent such an

evil violation to a characters body or soul

that only in a holy place, with holy magic,

can the damage be repaired.

Focus:  Caster  must  possess  a  mother

cyst (see page 28).

Victims  who  possess  necrotic  cysts

may  elect  to  have  some  well-meaning

chirurgeon  remove  them  surgically.

The procedure is a bloody, painful pro-

cess that incapacitates the subject for 1

hour on a successful DC 20 Heal check,

and kills the subject with an unsuccess-

ful  Heal  check.  The  procedure  takes  1

hour,  and  the  chirurgeon  cant  take  20

Protection from evil or a similar spell

prevents the necrotic cyst from form-

You  can  concentrate  upon  a  speci c

individual  who  you  believe  to  bear  a

necrotic  cyst  (see  spell  of  the  same

name),  and  hear  or  see  (your  choice)

almost  as  if  you  were  there.  Distance

is  not  a  factor,  but  the  spell  fails  if  the

individual no longer bears the cyst or if

the cyst bearer is no longer on the plane

of existence you are currently occupying.

If the chosen locale is magically dark, you

see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black,

you can see in a 10-foot radius around the

center of the spells effect. Lead sheeting

or magical protection (such as antimagic

 eld, mind blank, or nondetection) blocks

the spell, and you sense that the spell is

so blocked.

You  may  cast  the  following  spells

through necrotic scrying: comprehend lan-

guages, magic mouth, message, read magic,

tongues, and darkvision.

a common language is shared, you can

common  language  is  shared,  you  can

communicate  only  basic  commands,

such as Come here, Go there, Fight,

and Stand still. A subject may resist this

control, but the presence of his necrotic

tumor  on  his  brain  stem  ensures  their

loyalty.  Protection  from  evil  or  a  similar

spell does not protect the subject from

You  cause  the  cyst  of  a  subject  already

harboring  a  necrotic  cyst  (see  spell  of

the same name) to envelop a portion of

the victims brain. If the subject succeeds

on his saving throw (the subjects cyst-

derived  saving  throw  penalty  against

effects from the school of necromancy

applies), you may still in uence him by

suggesting a course of activity (limited to

a sentence or two). The instruction must

be worded in such a manner as to make

the activity sound reasonable. Asking the

creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a

spear, immolate itself, or do some other

obviously  harmful  act  automatically

negates the instruction. The instructed

course  of  activity  can  continue  for  the

entire duration. If the instructed activity

can be completed in a shorter time, the

instruction  ends  when  the  subject   n-

ishes what he was asked to do. You can

instead specify conditions that trigger a

special  activity  during  the  duration.  If

the condition is not met before the spell

expires, the activity is not performed.

If  the  subject  fails  his  saving  throw,

the  cyst  envelops  a  larger  portion  of

the  subjects  higher  brain,  and  you

gain  complete  control  of  the  actions

of the subject permanently. You do not

You  cause  the  cyst  of  a  subject  already

harboring  a  necrotic  cyst  (see  spell

Targets:  One  or  more  corpses  within

Duration: Instantaneous

Spell Resistance: No

This spell unleashes great necromantic

power, raising a host of undead creatures.

This spell turns the bones or bodies of

dead  creatures  within  the  spells  range

into  undead  skeletons  or  zombies  that

follow  your  spoken  commands.  The

undead remain animated until destroyed

(a destroyed skeleton or zombie cant be

animated again).

Regardless of the speci c numbers or

kinds of undead created with this spell,

you cant create more HD of undead with

this spell than four times your caster level

with a single casting of plague of undead.

The undead you create remain under

your control inde nitely. No matter how

many times you use this spell or animate

dead, however, you can only control 4 HD

worth  of  undead  creatures  per  caster

level.  The  limit  imposed  by  this  spell

and the animate dead spell are the same,

meaning that creatures you animate with

either spell count against this limit. If you

exceed this number, all the newly created

creatures fall under your control and any

excess undead from previous castings of

this spell or animate dead become uncon-

trolled. Any time that this causes you to

release only part of the undead that you

control through this spell or animate dead,

you  choose  which  undead  are  released

until the total HD of undead you control

is equal to four times your caster level.

The  bones  and  bodies  required  for

this spell follow the same restrictions as

animate dead (see page 199 of the Players

Handbook ). All of the bones and bodies to

be animated by this spell must be within

range when the spell is cast.

worth 100 gp or several black sapphires

Your  restore  animation  to  an  undead

creature destroyed by hit point loss (even

zombies and skeletons that cant normally

be reanimated once destroyed). You can

revive a destroyed undead that has been

inactive for up to one day per caster level.

In addition, the subjects animating spirit

must be free and willing to return. If the

subjects animating spirit is not willing to

return, the spell does not work; therefore,

subjects  that  want  to  revive  receive  no

saving throw.

Revive undead heals hit point damage

up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die to

an  undead.  The  body  of  the  undead  to

be  revived  must  be  whole.  Otherwise,

missing parts are still missing when the

creature is reanimated. None of the dead

creatures equipment or possessions are

affected in any way by this spell.

An  undead  that  has  been  turned  to

dust by a turning effect cant be revived

by this spell (because only dust remains

of the undead).

The subject of the spell loses one level

or HD (if it doesnt have a character class

level, it loses a HD) when it is revived.

This  level  loss  cannot  be  repaired  by

any  spell.  If  the  subject  is  1st  level,  it

loses 2 points of Charisma instead. An

undead that was destroyed with spells

prepared  has  a  50%  chance  of  losing

any  given  spell  upon  being  revived,

Level: Cleric 7, druid 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Targets: Undead creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

A touch from your hand limns an undead

creature in a faint yellow glow, making it

vulnerable to many of the dangers that can

harm living creatures. For the duration of

the spell, the undead creature is subject to

extra damage from critical hits (and thus

sneak attacks), nonlethal damage, ability

drain,  energy  drain,  fatigue,  exhaustion,

and  damage  to  its  physical  ability  scores

(though it still lacks a Constitution score

and thus cant take Constitution damage)

as if it were alive.

It  loses  its  immunity  to  effects  that

require  a  Fortitude  save,  as  well  as  its

invulnerability to poison, sleep effects,

paralysis, stunning, disease, and death

effects. However, an undead affected by

this spell gains a bonus on its Fortitude

saves  equal  to  its  Charisma  bonus  (if

any). (The bonus doesnt apply to Forti-

tude saves against effects that also affect

objects.) It must breathe, eat, and sleep

just like a normal creature (though the

last two arent likely to come into play

thanks to the spells short duration).

While  it  is  under  the  effect  of  this

spell,  both  negative  energy  (such  as

in ict spells)  and  positive  energy  (such

as cure spells) heal damage to the undead

creature, rather than damaging it.

An  undead  creature  affected  by  this

spell retains all other traits.

Any charges of the spell not used by the

time the duration expires are lost.

An undead creature you touch instead

gains 5 temporary hit points and you lose

a like amount (no save). Temporary hit

points gained in this way last for up to 1

hour.

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject does not rise as undead spawn

should she perish from an undeads attack

form that normally would turn her into

a spawn (such as from ghoul fever). This

spell  doesnt  prevent  the  subject  from

perishing  or  provide  anything  other

than  insurance  that  the  subjects  body

and  spirit  cannot  be  hijacked  by  an

acquisitive undead creature.

The protection applies if the duration

is still effect when the subject  rst dies;

the  spell  need  not  linger  in  its  effect

over  the  period  immediately  prior  to  a

spawns rise. This spell cannot be cast on

the body of a subject already killed by a

spawn-creating undead.

Spell Resistance: Yes

A touch from your hand, which crackles

with black energy, weakens the life force

of living creatures. Each touch channels

negative energy that bestows one nega-

tive level on the target and grants you 5

temporary hit points. Both the negative

level  and  the  temporary  hit  points  last

for  up  to  1  hour.  A  targets  successful

Fortitude  save  negates  the  negative

level and prevents you from gaining the

temporary  hit  points.  You  can  use  this

melee  touch  attack  once  per  round  for

a number of rounds equal to your level.

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: Limbs of one humanoid

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster chooses to wither either the

arms or the legs of a humanoid. Withered

legs force a subject to fall prone while at

the same time reducing the subjects land

speed to 5 feet. Withered arms make it

impossible for the subject to use objects or

cast spells with somatic components.

A withered limb can be restored by a

successful dispel magic cast by a spellcaster

of a level higher than the level of the wither

limb caster.

Wither limb

You  give  a  weapon  the  undead  bane

special  ability  in  addition  to  any  other

properties it has. Against undead, your

weapons enhancement bonus (if any) is

2 higher than normal and it deals an extra

2d6 points of damage against undead. The

spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon

that already has the undead bane special

ability. At caster level 9th (paladin level

18th) and above, the weapon gains a +1

enhancement bonus if it is not already a

magic weapon.

Alternatively, you can affect up to  fty

arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles

must be of the same kind, and they have

to be together, such as in the same quiver.

Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose

their transmutation when  red.

The  weapon  is  considered  good-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction. Any weapon affected

by this spell glows with a serene gray

radiance that sheds as much light as a

candle.

VEIL OF UNDEATH

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 min./level

You gain many of the traits common to

undead creatures. While the spell lasts,

you  have  immunity  to  mind-affecting

spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paraly-

sis, stunning, disease, death, extra damage

from  critical  hits,  nonlethal  damage,

death  from  massive  damage,  ability

drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion,

damage to physical ability scores, and any

effect requiring a Fortitude save unless

it is harmless or affects objects. You

need  not  breathe,  eat,

or sleep.

his chapter describes a variety of mundane, alchemical,

and magic items that might be common in campaigns

that prominently feature undead. Some function as weap-

ons against the walking dead, while others serve the cause

of undeath itself.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND

ALCHEMICAL SUBSTANCES

The special equipment in this section is particularly suited for

characters who deal with undead on a regular basis (either as

enemies or allies).

Brittlebone:  This  unguent  must  be  spread  over  a  set  of

bones before animation as a skeleton. The ointment reduces

the skeletons natural armor by 2 points (to a minimum of 0),

but when the skeleton is destroyed, its bones splinter and  y

apart, sending shards in all directions. Any creature within

the skeletons reach takes 1 point of piercing damage per HD

of the skeleton (Re ex DC 15 half; minimum 1 point).

Spreading britlebone over a creatures bones requires a full-

round action. A single  ask of the substance is suf cient for

a single creature of Medium size or smaller. A Large creature

requires two  asks, a Huge creature four  asks, a Gargantuan

creature eight  asks, and a Colossal creature sixteen  asks.

Bullet, Priests: These hollow glass sling bullets are  lled

with holy water. When they strike a target, they immediately

shatter, dousing the target with holy water. Undead and evil

outsiders take 1d4 points of damage from the holy water in

addition  to  the  normal  damage  from  the  sling  bullet.  To

hold suf cient holy water, these bullets must be larger than

normal, imposing a 2 penalty on the attack roll.

These bullets are useless against incorporeal creatures

(since they wont shatter on impact) unless they also have

the ghost touch special property or some other ability to

affect incorporeal creatures.

Unholy versions of these bullets are also available.

Embalming  Fire:  This  bitter-smelling  liquid  must

be poured over a corpse and allowed to soak for at least 1

minute before the corpse is animated as a zombie. Once

animated,  if  the  zombie  takes  even  a  single  point  of

damage, it bursts into blue  ame for 1 minute. This  re

does no damage to the zombie, but its attacks during

that time deal an additional 1d6 points of  re damage.

Spreading  embalming   re  over  a  creatures  body

requires  a  full-round  action.  A  single   ask  of  the

substance is suf cient for a single creature of Medium

size or smaller. A Large creature requires two  asks,

a Huge creature four  asks, a Gargantuan creature

eight  asks, and a Colossal creature sixteen  asks.

Ghostoil: This clear oil has a slight tint of gray,

and strange, wispy forms seem to swirl through it.

When applied to a weapon, ghostoil allows it to affect

incorporeal creatures normally for the next 2 rounds.

Applying ghostoil to a weapon of any size is a full-

round  action  that  provokes  attacks  of  opportunity.

One  ask of ghostoil contains enough liquid to coat

73

one weapon of Medium size or smaller. A Large weapon requires

two  asks, a Huge creature four  asks, a Gargantuan weapon

eight  asks, and a Colossal weapon sixteen  asks.

Holy Water Sprinkler: The oversized, hollow head of this

heavy mace is actually a reservoir that holds one pint of liquid

(typically  holy  or  unholy  water).  Any  hit  by  the  holy  water

sprinkler  also  affects  the  target  as  if  it  had  been  within  the

splash radius of a thrown  ask of holy water (1 point of damage

to undead creatures and evil outsiders for holy water, or to good

outsiders for unholy water). A full reservoir has eight uses.

Alternatively,  the  wielder  can  choose  to  release  the  entire

reservoir with a successful hit. Treat this as if the target had been

hit directly by a  ask of holy (or unholy) water, but subtract 1

point of damage for each use already dispensed from the res-

ervoir (for instance, a reservoir only 5/8 full would deal 2d43

points of damage). There is no splash effect from such a hit.

Filling the reservoir is a standard action that provokes attacks

of opportunity.

Liquid  Night:  This  dark,  sticky   uid  provides  a  daylight-

sensitive  undead  creature  with  temporary  protection  from

the  suns  deadly  rays.  It  allows  the  creature  to  ignore  any

vulnerability to sunlight for a full hour. If subjected to a spell

or magical effect that would cause extra damage to an undead

creature that is vulnerable to sunlight, the creature is treated

as not having that vulnerability (however, this also burns away

the liquid night, ending the protection against either mundane

or magical sunlight). Liquid night has a distinct musky odor of

moon ower (one of its ingredients).

Spreading liquid night over a creatures body requires a full-

round action. A single  ask of the substance is suf cient for

a single creature of Medium size or smaller. A Large creature

requires two  asks, a Huge creature four  asks, a Gargantuan

creature eight  asks, and a Colossal creature sixteen  asks.

POSITOXINS

Positoxins are special alchemical substances distilled from holy

water  and  laced  with  positive  energy.  To  a  corporeal  undead

creature,  a  positoxin  functions  much  like  a  poison,  usually

dealing  initial  and  secondary  ability  damage  or  drain  when

the  target  fails  a  Fortitude  save.  The  ability  damage  or  drain

dealt  by  most  positoxins  cant  reduce  an  undead  creatures

ability score below 1.

Despite their normal immunity to damage or drain to physi-

cal ability scores (Str and Dex), undead are vulnerable to the

ability damage or drain caused by positoxins. These substances

actually break down the physical form of the undead, while

simultaneously interfering with the unholy energies that keep

the undead creature animated. In fact, any damage dealt to an

undead creatures Str or Dex by a positoxin is actually perma-

nent ability drain, making such substances feared indeed by

such creatures.

A corporeal undead character has a 5% chance of exposing

itself to a positoxin whenever it applies the positoxin to a weapon

or otherwise readies it for use. Additionally, a corporeal undead

character who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a positox-

ined weapon must make a DC 15 Re ex save or accidentally

poison itself with the substance. A character who can handle

poisons safely, such as an assassin, can ignore these risks.

Positoxins  are  harmless  to  all  other  creatures,  including

incorporeal undead. As supernatural substances, positoxins dont

function in antimagic  elds or similar areas. Treat positoxins as

poisons for the purpose of spells and effects such as detect poison,

delay poison, and neutralize poison.

The characteristics of positoxins are summarized on Table

52: Positoxins. Terms on the table are de ned below.

Type: The positoxins method of delivery, and the Fortitude

save DC to avoid the positoxins damage. Most positoxins are

delivered  by  contact  or  injury,  since  undead  typically  dont

ingest or inhale substances.

Initial Damage: The damage the undead creature takes imme-

diately  upon  failing  its  saving  throw  against  the  positoxin.

Ability score reductions are temporary (ability damage) unless

an entry is marked with an asterisk (*), in which case the loss

is permanent (ability drain).

Secondary Damage: The amount of damage the undead creature

takes 1 minute after exposure to the positoxin, if it fails a second

saving throw. Ability score reductions are temporary (ability

damage) unless an entry is marked with an asterisk (*), in which

case the loss is permanent (ability drain).

Price: The cost of one dose (one vial) of the positoxin. It is not

possible to use or apply positoxin in any quantity smaller than

one dose. Unlike poisons, positoxins are not illegal, though their

cost and the dif culty in creating such substances can limit their

availability. (In societies controlled by undead, positoxins are

as illegal as poisons are in a typical society.)

Craft: The Craft (alchemy) DC required to create the positoxin.

Positoxins are very dif cult to distill; in addition to the high

Craft DC required, the crafting character must be able to chan-

nel positive energy to turn undead (or be assisted by a character

who has that ability).

Bloodwine: This thick, crimson positoxin includes garlic

in its creation, making it particularly harmful to vampires and

other  undead  with  a  vulnerability  to  garlic.  Such  creatures

take a 2  penalty  on  their Fortitude  saves to resist damage.

Though normally delivered by injury, it can also be consumed

by a living creature to deliver it to a vampire or similar blood-

draining creature via ingestion. A single dose, if consumed

by a living creature, remains in the bloodstream for 12 hours.

Any undead creature draining blood from a creature that has

ingested bloodwine must make a Fortitude save as if it had

been injured by a weapon bearing the positoxin, though the

save DC drops to 9.

Boneshard Paste: This positoxin includes bone fragments

in its recipe, giving it a pale color.

Celestial  Essence:  This  viscous  golden  substance  seems

almost to shine with an inner radiance.

Gravedust: This gray-brown powder derives its name from

its resemblance to the grime common to tombs and other long-

enclosed areas.

Lichbane:  This  bone-white  unguent  is  equally  dangerous

to all spellcasting undead, as well as to those that depend on

mental ability scores for their special attacks. The initial damage

is permanent drain.

Liquid Mortality: This potent oil is thought by most undead

creatures to be mere myth. Unlike other positoxins, it can reduce

the  targets  ability  score  to  0.  Any  undead  creature  whose

Strength is reduced to 0 by this positoxin is utterly destroyed.

Sunlight Oil: A thin, slippery liquid, sunlight oil lasts only

24 hours in conditions other than bright light.

MAGIC ITEMS

Any world that includes a signi cant number of undead can be

expected to develop a wide range of new magic items designed

to interact with those creatures. Some are intended for combat,

while others are more utilitarian in nature.

ARMOR

Magic armor and shields provide crucial defense against the

attacks of undead creatures. These two new special properties

are particularly appropriate in battle against the undead.

Ectoplasmic Feedback: A suit of armor with this property

creates a backlash of positive energy when its wearer is hit by an

incorporeal melee touch attack. This deals 1d6 points of damage

to the attacking creature (no save). The armors property has no

effect on corporeal creatures.

Faint  abjuration;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

ectoplasmic feedback; Price +8,000 gp.

Ghost  Ward:  A  suit  of  armor  or  shield  with  this  property

allows its wearer to add the armor or shields enhancement bonus

(but not its armor or shield bonus) to his Armor Class against

incorporeal touch attacks (but not against other touch attacks).

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, mage

armor; Price +1 bonus.

Undead Armor

Corporeal undead armor appears somewhat like normal armor,

in that it covers the body and provides protection from melee and

ranged attacks. However, undead armor is magically crafted from

the essence of various kinds of undead. This grants some undead

armor special qualities, such as damage reduction or more exotic

abilities, depending on the sort of undead creature from which the

armor was crafted. Incorporeal undead armor is even stranger, in

that it grants a de ection bonus instead of an armor bonus (since

it is comprised of an incorporeal undead creature).

Necromantic residue of the undead from which the armor was

crafted remains present in the armor. It is sometimes possible

to easily determine the kind of undead from which the armor

was  crafted  (for  instance,  exoskeleton  armor).  However,  not

enough residue of the original undead remains for the armor

to be treated as an actual undead creature (so undead armor cant

be turned).

Each of these suits of armor is a speci c armor enhanced by

magic and the necromantic energies of the undead used in its

creation. Anyone can wear undead armor, although those with

the  appropriate  armor  pro ciency  gain  the  most  bene t.  To

construct undead armor, a crafter needs, at minimum, to have

the Craft Arms and Armor Feat and 5 ranks in the Knowledge

(religion) skill.

Exoskeleton: This armor is prepared from an undead skel-

eton. The armor essentially covers your upper body with a rib

structure, providing protection equal to that of a +2 breastplate

and granting damage reduction 5/bludgeoning.

Faint  necromancy;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  animate  dead;  Price  49,500  gp;

Weight 30 lb.

Ghoul Shell: A suit of ghoul shell armor consists of shaped

and  tted sections of ghoul hide sewn and interlocked to cover

the  entire  body,  save  for  head,  hands,  and  feet.  Necromantic

residue remaining in the ghoul shell keeps the armor pliant

and responsive. This suit of +3 leather armor allows its wearer to

make up to three ghoul touch attacks per day, Fortitude DC 15.

Strong necromancy; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  create  undead;  Price  35,230  gp;

Weight 15 lb.

Ghost Shroud: A ghost shroud appears as a winding cloth in

which the body is wrapped, as if for burial. The shroud sometimes

appears, appropriately enough, ghostly and partially translucent.

A ghost shroud precludes wearing any other kind of armor. A

ghost shroud grants a +4 de ection bonus and allows its wearer

to make all attacks as if with a ghost touch weapon or effect.

Strong necromancy; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  create  undead;  Price  35,000  gp;

Weight .

Shadow Veil: A shadow veil appears as a indistinct, envelop-

ing covering. A shadow veil precludes wearing any other kind

of armor. A shadow veil grants a +2 de ection bonus. Someone

wearing  a  shadow  veil  is  hard  to  distinguish  in  shadow,  and

is treated as if having concealment (20% miss chance) against

creatures  without  darkvision,  blindsight,  or  other  sensory

apparatus that does not rely on light.

Strong necromancy; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  create  undead;  Price  10,000  gp;

Weight .

Vampire Hide: This armor is prepared from a single layer of

vampire skin. Necromantic residue remaining in the vampire hide

keeps the armor pliant and responsive. In addition to providing

the protective qualities of +3 studded leather, vampire hide grants

the wearer damage reduction 5/silver and magic.

Strong necromancy; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  create  undead;  Price  63,325  gp;

Weight 20 lb.

Wight Shield: A wight shield is a +1 light steel shield covered in

the undead hide of a wight. You can bash an opponent with a wight

shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table 75: Weapons

on page 116 of the Players Handbook for the damage dealt by a

shield bash. Used this way, a wight shield is a martial bludgeoning

weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a wight

shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you

lose its Armor Class bonus until your next action (usually until

the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not

improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it.

When you successfully deal damage to a living creature with

a wight shield bash, the creature must make Fortitude save DC

14 or gain a negative level.

Strong necromancy; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  create  undead;  Price  16,309  gp;

Weight 6 lb.

Wrapped Tower: A wrapped tower is a +2 tower shield wrapped

in the funerary wrappings of an undead mummy. Once per day,

the wielder can use the wrapped tower for total cover and the mere

sight of the mummylike faade requires all viewers in front of

the shield to succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with

fear for 1d4 rounds.

Strong necromancy; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  create  undead;  Price  6,330  gp;

Weight 45 lb.

Zombie Hide: This armor is prepared from a single layer of

zombie hide. While stiff, the joints provide some  exibility. This

+1 hide armor grants the wearer damage reduction 5/slashing.

Faint  necromancy;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

Knowledge  (religion)  5  ranks,  animate  dead;  Price  46,315  gp;

Weight 25 lb.

WEAPONS

Some of the special weapon properties here are intended for the

weapons of characters who  ght undead, while others work best

for weapons in the hands of the undead themselves.

Ghost Strike: A ghost strike weapon deals damage normally

against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus, just as if

it were a ghost touch weapon.

In addition, a ghost strike weapon can deliver sneak attacks or

critical hits to an incorporeal undead creature as if the creature

were not undead.

Only melee weapons can have the ghost strike ability.

Moderate conjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

ghost touch weapon, undeath to death; Price +2 bonus.

Profane: Upon command, a profane weapon is sheathed in

crackling black negative energy. A living creature who wields

a profane weapon when it is so energized takes 1 point of Con

damage each round he holds the weapon. The effect remains until

another command is given. A profane weapon deals an extra 1d6

points of damage to living creatures (or 2d6 against good outsiders)

on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow

the negative energy upon their ammunition. The weapon is also

treated  as  being  evil-aligned  (for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction) when sheathed in negative energy.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

in ict light wounds; Price +1 bonus.

Profane Burst: A profane burst weapon functions as a profane

weapon that also explodes with negative energy upon striking

a successful critical hit. (This effect occurs even if the target is

normally immune to critical hits.) The negative energy burst also

deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to a living wielder. In

addition to the extra damage from the profane ability (see above),

a profane burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of damage

to living creatures on a successful critical hit. If the weapons

critical  multiplier  is  3,  add  an  extra  2d10  points  of  damage

instead, and if the multiplier is 4, add an extra 3d10 points.

(Double the bonus dice of damage against good outsiders.) Bows,

crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the negative energy upon

their ammunition. Even if the profane ability is not active, the

weapon still deals its extra damage on a successful critical hit.

Strong conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

in ict critical wounds; Price +2 bonus.

Sacred: Upon command, a sacred weapon is sheathed in lumi-

nous positive energy. This energy does not harm the wielder unless

it is undead, in which case it takes 1 point of Charisma damage

per round it holds the weapon when it is so energized. The effect

remains until another command is given. A sacred weapon deals an

extra 1d6 points of damage to undead (or 2d6 against evil outsiders)

on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow

the positive energy upon their ammunition. The weapon is also

treated  as  being  good-aligned  (for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction) when sheathed in positive energy.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

cure light wounds; Price +1 bonus.

Sacred Burst: A sacred burst weapon functions as a sacred

weapon that also explodes with positive energy upon striking

a successful critical hit. (This effect occurs even if the target is

normally immune to critical hits.) The positive energy burst

does not harm the wielder unless it is undead, in which case

it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each time the weapon

bursts. In addition to the extra damage from the sacred ability

(see above), a sacred burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of

damage to undead on a successful critical hit. If the weapons

critical  multiplier  is  3,  add  an  extra  2d10  points  of  damage

instead, and if the multiplier is 4, add an extra 3d10 points.

(Double the bonus dice of damage against evil outsiders.) Bows,

crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the positive energy upon

their ammunition. Even if the sacred ability is not active, the

weapon still deals its extra damage on a successful critical hit.

Strong conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

cure critical wounds; Price +2 bonus.

Necrotic Focus: The magic weapon serves as a channel for

the wielders ability drain or energy drain supernatural ability,

allowing the wielder to deal ability drain or bestow negative

levels  through  the  weapon  as  if  attacking  with  its  natural

weapons. If a saving throw against the effect is allowed, add

the weapons enhancement bonus to the save DC. Only melee

weapons can have the necrotic focus ability.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

enervation, spectral hand; Price +3 bonus.

RODS

Magic rods contain unique effects and abilities. Some function

as weapons, while others have no combat abilities beyond their

magical properties. The four rods described here might all be

found in a campaign that features undead.

Nightstick: This black rod carved of darkly stained wood

is inset with religious symbols of various deities. Anyone who

possesses the rod and is able to turn or rebuke undead gains

four more uses of the ability per day.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, Extra Turning,

class ability to turn or rebuke undead; Price 7,500 gp.

Rod of De  ance: This white cudgel-like rod can be used as

a +2 heavy mace. All undead in a radius of 30 feet of the wielder

who holds the rod of de ance are treated as if they had 4 turn

resistance.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, class ability to

turn or rebuke undead; Price 13,000 gp.

Rod of Undead Mastery: This metal rod is carved to resemble

a stack of miniature skulls. Anyone who holds the rod can con-

trol twice as many undead than he normally could. For instance,

normally a caster cant control more HD of undead than four

times his caster level, but while holding the rod of undead mastery,

he can control eight times his caster level of undead.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, desecrate; Price

10,000 gp.

Scepter of the Netherworld: This plain steel baton contains

several glyphs incised along its length that promise power over

the undead. Anyone who holds the rod and has the power to

turn or rebuke undead is treated as if three levels higher than

his actual level when he uses his turning or rebuking power.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Rod, class ability to

turn or rebuke undead; Price 9,000 gp.

WONDROUS ITEMS

The assortment of wondrous items here runs the gamut of util-

ity, from offensive tools to defensive protections to the purely

utilitarian.

Bagpipes  of  the  Damned:  When  played,  these  bagpipes

help  bolster  undead  against  turning.  The  piper  must  make  a

DC  15  Perform  (wind  instruments)  check.  If  successful,  all

undead within 60 feet gain a +4 bonus on turn resistance for

10 rounds.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, able

to rebuke undead as a 10th-level cleric; Price 3,000 gp; Weight

4 lb.

Cloak  of  Turn  Resistance:  This  unholy  item  makes  its

wearer more dif cult to turn by adding a +4 bonus on its turn

resistance.

Moderate necromancy [evil]; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item,

able to rebuke undead as a 10th-level cleric; Price 11,000 gp.

Ectoplasmic Ichor: When this thick, translucent paste is

spread onto a corporeal object (requiring a standard action), it

allows incorporeal creatures to interact with that object as if they

were corporeal (much like a ghost touch weapon). A single vial

coats one Medium or smaller weapon, shield, or suit of armor, or

any other object of similar size. The effect lasts for 1 hour.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, ghost

touch; Price 500 gp.

Ghost Net: This gossamer-thin netting is thrown like a net,

except it only affects incorporeal creatures. If the net hits an

incorporeal target, the creature isnt entangled, but instead is

treated as corporeal for the purpose of dealing damage to it with

physical or magical attacks. It can be hit with normal weapons

(though  the  creatures  normal  damage  reduction,  if  any,  still

applies) and there is no 50% chance that it ignores damage from

corporeal sources. A creature ensnared by a ghost net also cant

turn ethereal (or, if snared on the Ethereal Plane, cant return

to the Material Plane).

The creature retains all other special abilities, and can extract

itself from the net with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round

action). The ghost net cant be burst by Strength.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, ghost

trap; Price 8,000 gp.

Ghoul Gauntlets: When worn by a living creature, these

mottled  gloves  virtually  meld  with  the  wearers  own   esh,

making his hands appear gaunt and rotting.

Once  per  round,  the  wearer  can  make  a  touch  attack  that

paralyzes the target for 1d6+2 rounds (Fortitude DC 13 negates).

Elves are immune to this paralysis. The wearer can also deliver

this attack as part of an unarmed strike, slam, claw, or similar

natural attack made with the hand, but in that case must attack

normally (and not with a touch attack).

The ghoul gauntlets have no effect when worn by a construct

or undead creature. If the wearer dies, the gauntlets revert to

their normal appearance.

Faint necromancy; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, ghoul touch;

Price 10,000 gp.

Globe of Sunlight: This golden  st-sized orb can be hurled

up to 50 feet. When it arrives at the end of its trajectory, it deto-

nates as a sunburst spell (Re ex DC 22 partial), except that the

radius of the burst is only 40 feet.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, sunburst;

Price 6,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Goggles of Day: The lenses of this item are made of silvered

crystal.  When  placed  over  the  eyes,  the  wearer  can  operate

without penalty in preternaturally bright light, such as might

result from a  are, sunbeam, or sunburst spell. A bonus side effect

allows vampires a full-round action prior to dissolution when

confronted with sunlight, as opposed to just a partial action.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, darkvision;

Price 4,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Goggles of Lifesight: The wearer of these goggles automati-

cally knows whether any visible creature within 30 feet is alive,

dead, undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct).

Moderate  divination;  CL  9th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item;  true

seeing; Price 2,000 gp.

Husk Globe: The bodies of humanoid creatures sacri ced

according  to  special  rituals  of  necromancy  can  be  placed  in

globes of glass or crystal, so they remain perfectly preserved

and  on  display  inde nitely.  Moreover,  husk  globes  retain  the

imprinted knowledge once possessed by the corpse preserved

within. Anyone who runs a hand across the surface of the globe

and commands the occupant to speak by their correct name can

ask questions of it. The questioner may ask up to ten questions

once the corpse is activated. The corpse answers telepathically,

mentally audible to all within 30 feet of the globe. The husks

knowledge  is  limited  to  what  it  knew  during  life,  including

the languages it spoke (if any). Answers may be brief, cryptic,

or  repetitive.  The  husk  can  be  activated  once  per  week.  The

husk can learn new information if told while active, and that

information may be retrieved later by different questioners.

UNDEAD

GRAFTS

Undead grafts are formed of

nonliving  esh attached to a

still-living body, the results

of vile experimentation by

living  necromancers  and

death  priests  seeking  to

become  more  like  what

they revere while remaining

on this side of death.

Grafts  have  no  statistics

of  their  own.  A  graft  might

improve  some  ability  or  char-

acteristic  of  the  creature  its

attached to, or grant the creature

some new ability. For example, a graft

might grant a creature a natural attack or

an inherent bonus to an ability score. Some

grafts are capable of independent actionthis

usually means that the graft can activate an ability or

take an action without the character having to spend an

Husk globe

ent but weighty as if forged of iron, not glass. The

whistle  resembles  a  small  dragon  curled  up  like  a

snail. When blown over a grave containing a body in darkness

or at night, one corpse below animates and claws its way to

the surface. The zombie serves the whistler faithfully until

it is destroyed, as if it were created with animate dead. The

whistle can be used once per week; however, the whistler can

acquire no more than two zombie followers at any one time

using night caller.

Faint  necromancy;  CL  5th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  animate

dead; Price 7,000 gp.

Nycoptic  Manuscripts:  These  twin  papyrus  scrolls  are

inscribed  with  ancient  tales  and  cryptic  prophecies  by  an

anonymous, almost-certainly insane author. Despite their dubi-

ous accuracy, the manuscripts contain many useful descriptions

of spells from the school of necromancy, and grant the possessor

a +5 competence bonus on any Knowledge (arcana) check she

makes  that  deals  with  necromantic  topics  as  the  long  as  the

scrolls  are  in  her  possession  and  the  character  can  take  1d4

rounds to  nd the proper reference.

Moderate  necromancy;  CL  10th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 2 lb.

Unholy Shrouds: These shrouds look like ordinary funerary

wrappings for dead bodies and are often decorated with symbols

and icons representing the dead rising. If a dead body is wrapped

in the shrouds, and the command word spoken, it returns as an

undead creature.

The kind of undead it returns as is determined by the type

of shroudslesser shrouds animate the corpse as a ghast, while

greater shrouds turn the body into a wraith. The undead creature

is not under anyones control when it rises, though it may be

commanded or controlled by the normal means.

Wrapping a body takes 10 minutes. The magic of the shrouds

is usable once only, after which the wrappings turn to dust.

action to do so. Such grafts always act on the characters turn.

Grafts are not magic items, but in game terms they function

very much like magic items. A character with the Graft Flesh feat

(see page 27) can create and apply grafts. The creator must be in a

quiet and comfortable setting, usually an alchemical laboratory

but in some cases an evil temple or similar locale. He needs a

supply of materials, which usually involve  esh or body parts

taken  from  another  creature  of  the  appropriate  type  or  kind.

The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for creating

the graft. Creating a graft costs half the given market price, and

otherwise works exactly like crafting a wondrous item, including

time required, preparation of spells required, and expenditure

of components, focuses, or XP required by the spells.

A graft does not radiate magic once completed, and it does

not count against a creatures limit for magic items worn. It does

not have a caster level. A graft is very hard, if not impossible,

to salvage as treasure. It should be considered to count against

the treasure value of the creature of the graft, which means that

creatures with grafts are still appropriate challenges for their

normal Challenge Rating, but have reduced treasure.

ACQUIRING AN UNDEAD GRAFT

Any spellcaster with the Graft Flesh feat (see page 27) and the

proper prerequisites can create and apply an undead graft. Mem-

bers of the pale master prestige class (see page 47) effectively

receive  certain  grafts  for  free  as  they  advance  in  levels,  and

become more adept in the use of their grafts as well.

Bonemail: Bonemail resembles armor crafted from interlock-

ing bones and shards of bone, but is actually part of the grafted

creatures body. Bonemail grants a +2 natural armor bonus to

the grafted creatures AC.

is incorporeal the arm has no Strength score and therefore gains

no bonus or penalty on damage rolls from the users Strength.

Graft Flesh, ethereal jaunt; Price 6,000 gp.

Mohrgs Tongue: This long, cartilaginous tongue bears sharp

claws at its tip. The grafted creature can make touch attacks with

the tongue (treat it as a secondary weapon). A successful touch

paralyzes the target for 1d4 minutes (Fortitude DC 17 negates).

Graft Flesh, ghoul touch; Price 24,000 gp.

Mummi  ed Eye: This hard, round orb  ts into a humanoid

creatures empty eye socket and looks much like a normal eye

at  rst glance, but it has a distinctly dry appearance and does

not move in the socket. The grafted creature can use the eyebite

spell as a 12th-level caster once per day.

Graft Flesh, eyebite; Price 50,000 gp.

Mummi  ed Hand: This withered hand is swathed in the

remnants of funereal wrappings. The grafted creature can use the

mummi ed hand to deliver a slam attack; the damage dealt is the

same as that dealt by a zombie of the creatures size. In addition,

three times per day the grafted creature can deliver mummy rot

with a slam attack. The choice to use mummy rot must be made

before the attack is rolled; if the attack misses, the daily use is

lost. The Fortitude save to resist the mummy rot is DC 16.

Graft Flesh, contagion; Price 16,200 gp.

Paralyzing  Arm:  A  paralyzing  arm  is  a  hardy  limb  of

preserved undead  esh. It grants a +4 inherent bonus to the

grafted creatures Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature

can use a paralyzing touch. A living creature touched must make

a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 minutes. Elves

are immune to this paralyzing touch. A touch that misses does

not count against the daily limit.

Graft Flesh, gentle repose, ghoul touch; Price 40,000 gp.

Skeletal Hand: The grafted creature can use this bony hand

to make claw attacks. The damage dealt is the same as that dealt

by a skeleton of the creatures size.

Graft Flesh, animate dead; Price 3,000 gp.

Undead  Skin:  This  mottled  gray  hide  grants  the  grafted

creature 25% resistance to critical hits and sneak attacks, similar

to armor of light forti cation. This resistance doesnt stack with

similar abilities.

Graft Flesh, animate dead; Price 16,000 gp.

Vampiric  Fangs:  This  set  of  sharp  teeth  replaces  the

creatures existing teeth. The grafted creature gains the ability

to drain blood from a living victim with its fangs by making

a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood,

dealing  1d4  points  of  Constitution  damage  each  round.  On

each such successful drain attack, the grafted creature gains 5

temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

Graft Flesh, vampiric touch; Price 25,000 gp.

Weakening Arm: A weakening arm is a skeletal forelimb that

grants a +4 inherent bonus to the grafted creatures Strength.

Twice per day, the grafted creature can use a weakening touch.A

living creature touched takes 1d6 points of Strength damage. A

touch that misses does not count against the daily limit.

Graft Flesh, ray of enfeeblement; Price 40,000 gp.

Zombie Arm: A zombie arm is a perpetually rotting limb.

It grants a +2 inherent bonus to the grafted creatures Strength,

but also permanently reduces the grafted creatures Dexterity

by 2. The grafted creature can use the zombie arm to make slam

attacks; the damage dealt is the same as that dealt by a zombie

of the creatures size.

Bodaks  Eye:  This  white,  empty  eye   ts  into  a  humanoid

creatures empty eye socket and allows the grafted creature to

make a death gaze attack once per day. The creature must use a

standard action to target a creature with the gaze, and the range

of the effect is 30 feet. A DC 15 Fortitude save negates the effect.

Unlike an actual bodaks death gaze, a target that dies from this

attack does not transform into a bodak 24 hours later.

Graft Flesh,  nger of death; Price 25,000 gp.

Enervating Arm: An enervating arm is a gaunt limb of desic-

cated, leathery  esh. It grants a +4 inherent bonus to the grafted

creatures Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature can use an

enervating touch to bestow one negative level on a living creature.

Removing the negative level requires a DC 14 Fortitude save. A

touch that misses does not count against the daily limit.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, enervation; Price 40,000 gp.

Eye  of  Flame:  This  crimson  eye-shaped  gem   ts  into  a

humanoid creatures empty eye socket and can produce a  reball

once per day upon command. The  reball deals 10d6 points of

damage (Re ex DC 14 half). Half of the damage is  re damage,

and the other half is divine damage that affects even targets

resistant to  re.

Graft Flesh,  reball; Price 10,800 gp.

Ghostly Arm: This gray, incorporeal arm cant be used to

manipulate solid objects. However, the grafted creature can use

the ghostly arm to deliver an incorporeal touch attack that deals

1d6  points  of  damage,  the  equivalent  of  a  ghosts  corrupting

touch attack. Treat the arm as a secondary weapon, but because it

he undead monsters and templates in this chapter will

help  DMs  build  unique  and  terrifying  encounters  for

their players.

USING THIS CHAPTER

These monsters are presented in the same general format as those

in the Monster Manual. Each entry is composed of a statistics block,

providing basic game information about the creature in condensed

form, and a passage of descriptive text in which the creatures

physiology, attacks, special abilities, and other important features

are discussed. Any abilities not described in the creatures entry are

discussed in the Monster Manual or the Dungeon Masters Guide.

CHALLENGE RATINGS

Table 61 provides a listing of all the new monsters presented

in this chapter, ranked by their Challenge Ratings. The monster

templates are also listed, ranked according to one of the sample

creatures given in the template description.

TEMPLATES

In  addition  to  new  monsters,  this  chapter  also  includes  a

number of templates that can be added to existing creatures:

evolved undead, ghost brute, gravetouched ghoul, half-vampire,

hooded pupil, mummi ed creature, necromental, necropoli-

tan, revived fossil, swarm-shifter, and umbral creature. Unless

otherwise indicated (such as with the half-vampire), these are

acquired templates rather than inherited templates.

As described in the Monster Manual, a creature can have

multiple templates, though the templates must be added one

at a time. Thus, some templates cannot be used together,

due to changes they make to a creatures type. For example,

the necropolitan and revived fossil templates can each be

applied to a humanoid creature, though they could not be

used on the same creature. Once you add either of these

templates, the creatures type changes to undead, so it no

longer quali es for the second template.

COMMON TYPES AND SUBTYPES

Many of the creatures described in this chapter have

similar  subtypes,  each  of  which  has  its  own  set  of

traits  (indicated  in  the  Special  Qualities  section  for

all applicable creatures).

Undead Traits

Unless otherwise indicated in an entry, all undead

creatures have the following traits.

No Constitution score.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Immunity to mind-affecting spells and abili-

ties, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and any effect that requires

a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on  objects  or  is

harmless.

Immunity  to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits,

nonlethal damage, damage to physical ability scores,

ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, and death from

massive damage.

Cannot heal damage on its own if it has no Intelligence

score. Negative energy can heal undead creatures. (See Undead

Metabolism, page 8.)

Uses its Charisma modi er for Concentration checks.

Not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced

to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.

Cannot be returned to existence by raise dead or reincarnate.

Resurrection and true resurrection can affect only willing undead,

but these spells turn undead back into the living creatures they

were before becoming undead.

Pro cient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons,

and any weapons mentioned in its entry.

Pro cient  with  whatever type  of  armor (light, medium,

or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types.

Undead not indicated as wearing armor are not pro cient with

armor. Undead are pro cient with shields if they are pro cient

with any form of armor.

Undead do not breathe, eat, or sleep.

Incorporeal Traits

An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures

that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or

supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack

forms.  Even  when  hit  by  spells  or  magic  weapons,  an  incor-

poreal creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a

corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy,

force effects such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost

touch weapons). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water

can affect an incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has

a 50% chance of not affecting it.

An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has

a  de ection  bonus  equal  to  its  Charisma  modi er  (always  at

least +1, even if the creatures Charisma score does not normally

provide a bonus).

An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects

(though not through force effects), but must remain adjacent

to the objects exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an

object whose space is larger than its own. Incorporeal creatures

also pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air.

Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling damage.

An  incorporeal  creatures  attacks  ignore  natural  armor,

armor, and shields, but de ection bonuses and force effects

UNDEAD SWARMS AND TURNING

Because  undead  swarms  are  made  up  of  many  weak  undead

creatures,  they  are  more  vulnerable  to  turning  than  normal

undead. For all purposes related to a turning check or turning

damage, treat the undead swarm as having only one-half (50%)

of its normal Hit Dice. Add any turn resistance only after halving

the swarms HD.

Example: A  corpse  rat  swarm  has  8  Hit  Dice.  However,  it  is

treated as having only 4 HD for the purpose of determining the

success of a turning check (and is therefore much easier to turn

than a normal 8 HD undead creature). Furthermore, for every 4

HD  of  undead  affected  by  the  clerics  turning  damage  roll,  the

cleric turns one swarm. If the turning characters cleric level is 8th

or higher, the corpse rat swarms are destroyed instead of turned.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

(such as mage armor) work normally against them. Incorporeal

creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can they

be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physi-

cal action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its

equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. Incorporeal

creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are trig-

gered by weight.

An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be. Nonvisual senses,

such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly

effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal crea-

tures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full

speed even when they cannot see.

Additional information about incorporealness

is given in the Running Undead Encounters

section starting on page 135.

treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent

creatures. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to

the swarm per spell level (or Hit Die of the originating creature,

in the case of effects such as an air elementals whirlwind).

A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage

becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until

its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.

Swarms also gain the distraction ability, described below.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a swarms

damage that begins its turn with the swarm in its square is nau-

seated for 1 round; a Fortitude save negates the effect (DC 10

+ 1/2 swarms Hit Dice + swarms Con modi er). Even with a

successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within

the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 +

spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration

requires a DC 20 Concentration check. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Swarm Traits

A  swarm  has  no  clear  front  or  back

and  no  discernible  anatomy,  so  it  is

not  subject  to  critical  hits  or   anking.

A  swarm  made  up  of  Tiny  creatures  takes

half  damage  from  slashing  and  piercing

weapons.  A  swarm  composed  of  Fine

or Diminutive creatures is immune to

weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or

fewer  causes  the  swarm  to  break  up,

though  damage  taken  until  that  point

does not degrade its ability to attack or

resist  attack.  Swarms  are  never  stag-

gered  or  reduced  to  a  dying  state

by damage. Also, they cannot be

tripped, grappled, or bull rushed,

and they cannot grapple another.

A  swarm  is  immune  to  any

spell or effect that targets a speci c

number  of  creatures  (including

single-target  spells  such  as  dis-

integrate),  with  the  exception  of

mind-affecting spells and abilities

if  the  swarm  has  an  Intelligence  score  and

a hive mind. A swarm takes a 10 penalty on

saving  throws  against  spells  or  abilities  that

affect an area, such as many evocation spells

and splash weapons. If the area attack does not

allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double

damage instead.

Though swarms are extremely dif cult to  ght

with physical attacks, they have a few special

vulnerabilities, as follows: A lit torch swung as

an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of  re

damage per hit. A weapon with a special abil-

ity such as  aming or frost deals its full energy damage with

each hit, even if the weapons normal damage cant affect the

swarm. A lit lantern can be used as a splash weapon, dealing

A repulsive, extremely tall, humanlike creature with

long, rotting wings and peeling  esh, this monstros-

ity continually sheds rivulets of  lth and decay, creat-

ing a pool of rot in which it stands.

A mockery of a true angel, an angel of decay may

appear similar to an angelic outsider only by hap-

penstance, not design. It is an undead creature that

is powered by decay.

When a healthy creature softens, crumbles, and

lique es  in  death,  an  inde nable  essence  wafts

away like putrid steam off stagnant beach sand. This

decomposing  esh radiates an essential energy in

its dissipation, and an angel of decay can extract

the power resident therein.

An  angel  of  decay  stands  about  9  feet  tall  and

weighs between 500 and 700 pounds.

Angels of decay speak Common and Abyssal.

COMBAT

An  angel  of  decay  prefers  to  wade  into  combat,

literally, since when it touches down, it produces a

constantly renewing pool of liquid corruption.

An angel of decay normally attacks using its Power

Attack feat, taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and

gaining a +5 bonus on damage rolls.

Rotting Aura (Su): When the creature is not  ying,

rivulets of vile corruption stream from an angel of decays

body, constantly regenerating and renewing a pool of odifer-

ous rot all around the creature.

An angel of decays pool of rot is a 15-foot-radius spread. Any

corporeal  creature  standing  on  the  ground  within  that  area

must make a DC 24 Re ex saving throw each round or take

5d6 points of damage (half that on a successful save) as its  esh

begins to succumb to decay. The creature must also succeed on

a subsequent DC 24 Will saving throw (regardless of whether

it succeeds on the  rst save) or be nauseated for 1 round.

In each round that a creature takes damage from an angel of

decays rotting aura, the angel of decay heals 5 points of damage

per victim.

Rotting Touch (Su): An angel of decay that hits a single foe

with more than one attacks in a round rots its opponents  esh.

This effect automatically deals an extra 1d6+6 points of damage

and heals the angel of decay of 5 points of damage.

Unholy  Grace  (Su):  An  angel  of  decay  adds  its  Charisma

modi er as a bonus on all its saving throws and as a de ection

bonus to its Armor Class. (The statistics block already re ects

these bonuses.)

New feat described on page 27.

This  creatures  hairless,  overlarge  head  surmounts  its  wet,

wrinkled,  and  bloated  humanoid  body.  Its  eyes  are  glassy  and

vacant. Its arms are too slender, and its tiny hands end in cruelly

sharpened  nails,  while  its  legs  are  atrophied,  dead  things  that

hang useless below it.

Atropal scions are clots of divine  esh given form and anima-

tion by bleak-hearted gods of death. When a stillborn godling

rises spontaneously as an undead, a great abomination is born.

If  that  abomination  is  defeated,  but  any  fragment  or  cast-off

bit of  esh remains, an atropal scion may yet arise from those

fragments, lessened in power from its divine beginnings, but

no less hateful for its stature.

Level Adjustment: 

New feat described on page 27.

Appearing similar to a corpse that has been dug up and surgically

modi ed, this creature stands nearly 7 feet tall, but is extraordi-

narily thin. Its arms are extra long, hanging nearly to mid-calf.

Its  head  is  wide  and  wedge-shaped,  with  a  split  mouth  that

opens  wider  than  that  of  a  normal  humanoid.  Its  teeth  glitter

like shards of black, steaming ice.

Crafted  in  bygone  days  by  power-mad  wizards  searching  to

create  the  perfect  undead  guardians,  blasphemes  still  roam

forgotten areas, seeking to destroy nonevil creatures with their

blasphemous bite. They are most likely to be encountered near

ruins of ancient cities where magic was valued more highly than

personal liberty or morals. If the secret of creating or calling

a blaspheme into the world still exists, it is buried in just such

a location.

Each blaspheme is created with parts from multiple ancient

corpses, with teeth specially harvested from sacri ces to evil

powers.  However,  blasphemes  are  not  hulking,  slow-moving

constructs; rather, they are lithe and deadly, aware of their sur-

roundings and capable of directing their own actions.

Blasphemes stand just under 7 feet tall and weigh about 190

pounds.

Blasphemes speak Common.

Blaspheme

An atropal scion is a power to be reckoned with, and once

animate in the world, seeks power over both life and unlife in

an unrelenting bid for domination that only its lifeless tissue

is able to sustain.

Atropal  scions  speak  Common,  Abyssal,  Infernal,  and

Celestial.

COMBAT

A soul-numbing cold comes before and follows an atropal scion.

The life energy of heroic creatures is suppressed in its foul aura,

and the life force of lesser creatures is extinguished. It directs

its spell-like abilities and death gaze upon those foes its mere

presence cannot kill.

Death  Gaze  (Su):  Death,  range  60  feet;  Fortitude  DC  19

negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. Humanoids who die

from this attack are transformed into wights 24 hours later.

Negative  Energy  Aura  (Su):  A  60-foot-radius  negative

energy aura surrounds an atropal scion. All undead in the aura

(including the atropal scion) are treated as if they have +4 turn

resistance and fast healing 5. Living creatures in the aura are

treated as having two negative levels unless they have some sort

of negative energy protection or protection from evil. Creatures

with 2 or less HD fall dead in the negative energy aura (and, at

the atropal scions option, rise as wights under the atropal scions

command 1 minute later).

Rebuke  Undead  (Su):  An  atropal  scion  can  rebuke  or

command undead as a cleric of the same level as the atropal

scions HD.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayanimate dead, create undead, cone

of cold (DC 18), desecrate, dispel magic, invisibility, plane shift, speak

with dead, teleport. Caster level 9th.

Unholy  Grace  (Su):  An  atropal  scion  adds  its  Charisma

modi er as a bonus on all its saving throws and as a de ection

bonus to its Armor Class.

COMBAT

A blaspheme resonates with evil power, the focus of which is

concentrated in its teeth. Thus, blasphemes charge into combat

in almost every situation, attempting to bite their victims as

quickly as possible.

Blasphemous Contact (Su): Each time a blaspheme bites

a nonevil creature, the creature is dazed for 1 round and takes

1d6 points of Strength damage. There is no saving throw against

this effect.

Erratic  Charge  (Ex):  When  a  blaspheme  charges,  it  can

make one turn of up to 90 degrees during its movement. All

other restrictions on charges still apply. For instance, it cannot

pass through a square that blocks or slows movement, or one

that contains a creature. A blaspheme must have line of sight

to a targeted opponent at the start of its turn.

Inescapable  Craving:  A  blaspheme  has  an  inescapable

craving (see the Undead Metabolism section in Chapter 1)

for Strength, which it satis es by using its blasphemous

contact ability.

Bleakborn

This frigid corpse is so cold that it is frosted with icy crystals. Sens-

ing the warmth of life, it shambles eagerly toward its victims. Its

86

eyes re ect the vacuum of the void, its touch chills to the bone,

and its very presence seems to drain the heat from your pores.

When inactive, a bleakborn appears to be nothing but a human-

oid  corpse,  slain  either  by  bitterly  cold  conditions  (or  if  in  a

warmer environment, as if by a magical cold attack so potent that

the corpse still sparkles with ice crystals). However, whenever

any living creature comes to within 30 feet of an inactive bleak-

born, the warmth and life of the interloper revive the undead

creature, giving it purpose and a icy semblance of life.

Bleakborns are also referred to as Moil zombies in some

lesser-known tomes about undead, in supposed

reference to the cursed city in which they  rst

arose. A bleakborn is not marked by direct

violence; rather, it looks like a humanoid that

has been  ash-frozen, with discoloration

and  some  ruptured   esh  showing  here

and there.

A bleakborn stands a little over 6 feet tall and

weighs between 150 and 230 pounds.

Bleakborns speak Common and their own

language (called Moilian).

COMBAT

A  bleakborn  actively  moves  toward  living

creatures, attempting to keep them within range

of its heat-draining aura. If possible, a bleakborn

pummels a living creature with its ice-cold limbs,

hoping to deprive its victim of all warmth and life.

Cold  to  the  Touch  (Su):  The  touch  of  a  bleakborn

deals  2d6  points  of  cold  damage.  Each  3  points  of  cold

damage  dealt  heals  a  bleakborn  of  1  point  of  damage.

If  this  amount  of  healing  would  cause  a  bleakborn  to

exceed its full normal hit point total, it gains any excess

as temporary hit points.  These temporary hit points last

for up to 1 hour. Anyone who hits a bleakborn in melee

also takes 1d6 points of cold damage, unless wielding a

reach weapon.

Contingent  Healing:  A  bleakborn

only  heals  when  in  range  of  a  liv-

ing  creature  that  it  can  affect  with

its  heat-draining  aura.  Even  if

brought  to  0  hit  points  or  less,  a

bleakborn  eventually  heals  if  a

living creature at some fu-

ture date wanders within

30  feet  of  the  bleakborns

remains, automatically trig-

gering its heat-draining aura.

As long as affected creatures are

within its heat-draining aura, a

bleakborns contingent healing

remains active.

A  bleakborn  does  not  have

immunity  to  cold.  While  a  bleakborn  doesnt

take cold damage from its own abilities, it can take

cold damage from another of its kind.

Create  Spawn  (Su):  Any  humanoid  slain  by  a  bleakborn

becomes  a  normal  zombie  in  1d4  rounds.  These  spawn  are

under the command of the bleakborn that created them and

remain enslaved until its destruction. They do not possess any

of the abilities they had in life.

Sometimes  a  newly  created  spawn

becomes a bleakborn instead of a mere

zombie,  though  the  wiles  of  the  dark

gods determine such instances (that is,

the DM decides when this occurs).

Diet Dependent: Bleakborns are diet

dependent (see the Undead Metabolism

section  in  Chapter  1)  upon  warmth,

which  they  gain  through  their  heat-

draining aura, as described below.

Fire Lover (Su): A magical  re attack

heals a bleakborn of 1 point of damage

for  each  3  points  of  damage  the  attack

would  otherwise  deal.  If  this  amount

of  healing  would  cause  bleakborn  to

exceed its full normal hit point total, it

gains any excess as temporary hit points.

These temporary hit points last for up to

1 hour. For example, a bleakborn hit by a

 reball that would normally deal 18 points

of damage instead gains 6 hit points. A

bleakborn  makes  no  saving  throws

against  re effects.

Heat-Draining Aura (Su): All living

creatures (except those immune to cold

damage) that approach within 30 feet of a

bleakborn are subject to its heat-draining

aura. Victims must make a DC 16 Forti-

tude save. If they fail, they take 2d6 hit

points of cold damage per round as their

living heat is sucked away, but if they suc-

ceed,  they  lose  only  1d6  hit  points  per

round  that  they  remain  in  the  radius.

Should  a  bleakborn  kill  a  humanoid

creature with its heat-draining aura, the

victim rises again as a bleakborn spawn.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

A  clot  of  animate  blood  the  size  of

a small house, this amoeba of failed

life is hungry to add new blood to its

oozing body.

The half-congealed blood of past vic-

tims gives a blood amniote its form,

and its ties to the Negative Energy

Plane give the creature animation.

Mindless, it seeks only to pierce the

 eshy carapace of all living creatures

it comes upon so it can draw out the

blood beneath.

Though  these  creatures  are

mindless,  vestiges  of  past  victims

completely  drained  of  blood  re-

main imprinted on them. Observers

sometimes see these random memo-

ries as faces that brie y form on the

surface of a blood amniote, only to

fall away again to formlessness mo-

ments later.

COMBAT

When a blood amniote senses poten-

tial prey, it quickly moves to engage,

hoping to draw out the blood of its

victims in full quantity.

Blood  Call  (Su):  Whenever  a

blood amniote strikes a living crea-

ture  in  melee  combat,  its  touch

causes  the  targets  body  to  expel  a

portion  of  its  own  blood  through

the pores. The expelled blood gath-

ers and  ows across the intervening distance between

the prey and the blood amniote. This attack deals 1d4 points of

Constitution damage to the foe.

Blood amniote

If a blood amniote deals as many points of Constitution dam-

age during its existence as its full normal hit point total, it self

spawns (see below).

Inescapable Craving: A blood amniote has an inescapable

craving (see the Undead Metabolism section in Chapter 1) for

blood, which it satis es by using its blood call ability.

Ooze Traits: Despite being undead, a blood amniote has all

the  bene ts  and  disadvantages  of  being  an  ooze.  Like  oozes,

blood  amniotes  do  not  receive  any  feats.  Blood  amniotes  are

mindless and are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abili-

ties, and they are blind, giving them immunity to gaze attacks,

visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

Blood amniotes also have immunity to poison, magic sleep effects,

paralysis, polymorph, and stunning, and they are not subject to

extra damage from critical hits or  anking.

blood thirst. While a living mosquito is hardly more than an

unlike  a  skeleton  or  similar

monster, a boneyards form is  u-

id in the sense that it can appear

merely as a pile of bones, or as a ser-

pent composed of bones, or some

other form of its choice. Boneyards

have been called by many names,

depending upon where they are en-

countered, including bone weirds,

dancing bones, and bonetakers.

A  boneyard  weighs  between

4,000 and 8,000 pounds, depend-

ing on the number of bones it has

subsumed.

Boneyards speak Common, Ter-

ran, and Abyssal.

A boneyard seeks to bite and subsume the bones of its foes. If it

can start a grapple, it pulls victims directly into its mass.

Bone Subsumption (Su): Whenever a boneyard successfully

bites a foe, the victim must make a DC 22 Fortitude save (except

for undead victims, which make Will saves). The save DC is Cha-

risma-based. On a failed save, the victims bones begin to melt

away from the body to meld with the form of the boneyard. The

victim takes 2d4 points of damage to Constitution, Dexterity,

and Strength. This ability works only on creatures that possess

a skeletal structure (so it works on many undead, but it is useless

against constructs, elementals, oozes, and plants).

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a boneyard must hit a

Large or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and

can try to utterly subsume all the bones in the victims body.

Inescapable Craving: A boneyard has an inescapable craving

(see the Undead Metabolism section in Chapter 1) for bones,

which it satis es by using its bone subsumption ability.

Summon Skeletons (Su): A boneyard can summon undead

creatures from its own bones once per day: 36 troll skeletons

or 24 young adult red dragon skeletons. The undead arrive in

1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until they are reabsorbed

back into the boneyard.

Utter Subsumption (Su): If a boneyard wins

a  grapple  check  after  using  its  improved  grab

ability, it attempts to pin the target on its next

action.  A  boneyard  that  begins  a  turn  with  a

victim still pinned and that makes one more

successful grapple check automatically tears

every bone from the victims body, instantly

killing the victim.

Something  gray  and  shriveled

sloshes within a grimy glass canis-

tera disembodied brain a oat in

alchemical preservatives.

The  brain  in  a  jar  is  a  masterpiece  of

preservationbut  where  alchemical  pre-

servatives leave off, necromancy picks up. An animate

brain in a jar is, in truth, an undead creature. Additionally, pos-

sibly because it is free of the need to worry about controlling

and animating an entire body, a brain in a jar possesses potent

mental powers.

Of course, merely removing the brain of a zombie or some

other  undead  creature  and  storing  it  in  alchemical

preservatives is not enough to create an undead brain

with psionic ability. The ritual of extraction, the spells

of formulation, and the alchemical recipes of preserva-

tion are closely guarded secrets held by only a few

master necromancers.

The creation of a brain in a jar is dif cult and

fraught with danger, because once its mental

powers are fully developed, this undead crea-

ture is adept at controlling the thoughts and

minds  of  other  creatures,  especially  living

creatures. It is not unknown for a brain in

a jar to take control over the necromancer

who created it.

A brain in a jar weighs about 25 pounds,

which  includes  the  weight  of  the  glass

canister and the preservative  uids.

A brain in a jar can speak telepathically

to any creature within 100 feet that has a

language.

COMBAT

A brain in a jar prefers control to direct

combat, since brains in fragile glass jars

cant  stand  too  much  jostling.  How-

ever,  when  it  cant  stay  completely

clear  of  combat,  it  seeks  to  put

off  aggressors  with  its  mind

thrust ability.

Brain in a jar

Mind  Thrust  (Su):  A  brain  in  a  jar  can  spend  a  standard

action to deliver a massive assault on the thought pathways of

any one creature, undermining its intellect. This mind thrust

deals 2d10 points of damage to any target creature that fails a

DC 14 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Madness  (Su):  Anyone  targeting  a  brain  in  a  jar  with  a

thought detection, mind control, or any sort of telepathic or

psionic ability that makes direct contact with its tortured mind

takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

Psionics (Sp): 3/daysuggestion (DC 16), telekinesis (DC 18);

1/daydominate person (DC 18). Manifester level 10th. The save

DCs are Charisma-based.

Rebuke Undead (Su): A brain in a jar can rebuke or command

undead as a cleric of the same level as the brains HD.

+4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and 2 to Armor Class. Sens-

ing its victims death, the carcass eater claws and bites until its

opponent is brought to negative hit points, at which time the

creature immediately gains an additional bite attack against its

fallen foe. This attack automatically hits, dealing 1d4+1 points

carcass eater cannot end its rage voluntarily.

Like a  re elemental, a cinder-

less the creature can step or

A  cinder-

Charisma Drain (Su):

Cinderspawn

Living  creatures  hit

is Charisma-based.

Elemental  Turning  Vulnerability  (Ex):  A

Like a bone rat swarm, a corpse rat swarm is made up of countless

undead rats. These, however, are closer to zombies than skeletons,

bit as hungry for  esh.

COMBAT

A corpse rat swarm seeks to engulf and devour any living prey

any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move.

Disease (Ex): Filth feverswarm attack, Fortitude DC 16,

A lone, wavering  gure begins a song.

The  haunting  melody  echoes  through

the  air,  calling  for  you  to  dance.  The

music  makes  your  soul  shrivel,  but  it

also  makes  you  smile.  How  can  some-

thing be so awful and so wonderful at the

same time?

A crypt chanters voice is the perfect horror, at once compelling

and dreadful. These undead creatures sometimes appear to be

playing spectral viols,  utes, drums, or any other instruments

they choose, varying from chanter to chanter.

As incorporeal creatures, crypt chanters are weightless.

A  crypt  chanter  never  speaks  directly,  though  it  may  give

instructions or provide answers within the lyrics of its music

(usually in Common, sometimes Abyssal).

COMBAT

A crypt chanters strength and shield is its music. A crypt chanter

seeks to snare its victims with its music, and then drain them of

life with the same melody. If threatened, a crypt chanter retreats

into a nearby wall or other handy physical barrier.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a crypt chanter

through its draining melody (see below) becomes a crypt chanter

1d4 rounds later. Spawn are under the command of the crypt

chanter that created them and remain enslaved until its destruc-

tion. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Draining Melody (Su): A crypt chanter constantly sings,

creating a magically charged allure. All creatures within 60 feet

of a crypt chanter must make a DC 18 Will save or stand dazed

as long as the music continues. This is a sonic, mind-affecting,

compulsion effect.

Beginning on the round after becoming dazed, crea-

tures that failed the  rst saving throw must make

a second saving throw (same DC) to avoid

being affected as if by

the enthrall spell (see

page  227  of  the

Players  Handbook).

Enthralled victims

also  begin  to  gain

1d2  negative  levels

per  round  while

the  song  contin-

ues,  as  long  as

they  remain

within range.

If a creature gains a number of negative levels at least equal to

its Hit Dice, it dies and becomes a spawn.

When a crypt chanter bestows negative levels on a victim, it

gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed.

These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.

Creatures that successfully save upon hearing a crypt chanters

music cannot be affected by that crypt chanters music again

unless the chanter ceases singing for 1 full round (releas-

ing all those it previously held in thrall) and begins a new

song. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Daylight Powerlessness (Ex): A crypt chanter is utterly

powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and

 ees from it.

Skeletally thin, this  gure wears a dramatic cloak fringed with

magical sigils. Its cadaverous eyes sizzle with cursed power, and

deadly spells dance on its  ngertips.

Deathlocks are undead born of the corpses of powerful spellcast-

ers whose remains are so charged with magic that they are unable

to lie quiet in the grave. Animate, but shorn of the spirit that once

ruled their forms, deathlocks seek to bring all those they meet

into an intimate embrace with death. Only their knowledge of

spellcasting remains, though twisted and changed.

Sometimes  deathlocks  retain  a  single  shred  of  memory

from  their  former  spirits.  If  the  recollection  was  dear  to  the

spirit that once inhabited the now shriveled and blasted body

of the deathlock, the creature usually seeks out the source of

that memory, hoping to destroy it, compromise it, or undo the

deeds associated with it.

Deathlocks stand between 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh

between 100 and 120 pounds.

Deathlocks speak Common, Abyssal, and Infernal.

A deathlock prefers to use its spell-like abilities from a distance,

disdaining melee. Thus, it can also use in ict minor wounds to

heal itself.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willdetect  magic,  in ict  minor

wounds  (DC  13),  read  magic;  3/daycause  fear  (DC  13),  magic

This  small,  salt-encrusted  humanoid

 gure looks parched and gasping. Around

it, a dry, hot breeze seems to blow from

nowhere.

Desiccators are the dried-out undead

remnants  of  creatures  of  elemental

water. They long to quench their tre-

mendous thirst with the precious  uids

of living creatures.

Thanks to their withered

forms,  desiccators  are

sometimes  mistaken  for

mummies,  although  they

wear  none  of  the  wrappings

common  to  those  creatures.

Cursed to remain forever bereft

of the watery form it had in life, the

desiccator envies and despises all living things.

Most desiccators stand about 4 feet tall but weigh only 30 to

40 pounds.

Desiccators speak Aquan.

COMBAT

A desiccator opens combat with its breath weapon, seeking to

weaken opponents resistance to its fatiguing touch.

Desiccating  Breath  (Su):  15-foot  cone  of  desiccating  air

every  1d4  rounds,  damage  1  Con,  Fortitude  DC  15  negates.

(Creatures  with  the  water  subtype  take  a  4  penalty  on  this

save.) The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus

from the Ability Focus feat.

Fatiguing Touch (Su): The slam of a desiccator, in addition to

dealing 1d8 points of damage, makes living creatures fatigued.

A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the fatigue but not the

damage.  (Creatures  with  the  water  subtype  take  a

4  penalty  on  this  save.)  If  the  victim  fails  the

save, the desiccator also gains 5 temporary hit

points, which last for up to 1 hour. A creature

already fatigued cannot become exhausted

as  a  result  of  this  touch.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Elemental Turning Vulnerability (Ex):

A character who can turn undead and also

turn water creatures gains a +2 bonus on

turning checks to turn a desiccator. A

character who can rebuke undead

and also rebuke water creatures

gains  a  +2  bonus  on  turning

checks to rebuke a desiccator.

A maggot is the worm-shaped larva of a  y, but a dire

maggot  is  the  larva  of  similarly  monstrous   ying

vermin.  While  regular  maggots  are  found  in

decaying matter, dire maggots are large, quick,

and aggressive enough to seek out living

prey for nourishment.

COMBAT

Dire  maggots  seek  to  paralyze

their prey, though still-squirm-

ing  prey  is  just  as  good  to  the

mindless maggot.

Paralytic Saliva (Ex): A creature

bitten by a dire maggot must make

a  DC  14  Fortitude  save  or  be

paralyzed for 1 round. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Dream vestige

The original dream vestige was born from the nightmares of an

entire city, as all of its citizens died in cursed sleep (a curse that

some attribute to Orcus). Since then, that creature has spawned

itself many times over.

A dream vestige is a hunter; it hunts for other creatures to

incorporate into itselfmind and body, living or undead. Thus,

even  the  undying  have  cause  to  fear  a  dream  vestige,  which

preys on its own. It stalks prey on rooftops, behind walls, or

under   oors,  unseen  by  its  victims.  A  sudden  visceral  dread

(its frightful presence ability) heralds the creatures arrival, at

which time the whispers, moans, and lamenting of its subsumed

victims becomes audibly apparent.

A dream vestige understands the languages of all those who

have been integrated into it, which essentially means it knows

all the most prevalent languages.

COMBAT

A  dream  vestige  uses  its  incorporeal  tendrils  to  disrupt  and

crumble the minds and bodies of the living, seeking to draw

ever more creatures into itself.

Desecrating Aura (Su): A dream vestige gives off a 20-foot-

radius emanation of utter desecration, imbuing its surroundings

with negative energy. This ability works much like a desecrate

spell, except the vestige itself is treated as the shrine of an evil

power. All undead within 20 feet of the dream vestige (includ-

ing the creature itself) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls,

damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The

dream  vestiges  Hit  Dice,  attack,  and  save  entries  given  here

already include these profane bonuses.) Charisma checks made

to turn undead within this area take a 6 penalty.

A dream vestiges desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except

by a dispel evil spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled,

the dream vestige can resume it as a free action on its next turn.

Its desecrating aura is suppressed if a dream vestige enters a

consecrated or hallowed area, but the dream vestiges presence

also suppresses the consecrated or hallowed effect for as long

as it remains in the area.

Form Consumption (Su): Each touch by a dream vestiges

tendril drains a portion of the victims mind (though non-

intelligent  or  mindless  creatures  are  immune  to  a  dream

vestiges  lascivious  caresses).  Each  touch  deals  1d4  points

of Intelligence drain to the victim. When a dream vestige

drains a victims Intelligence, it gains 5 temporary hit points,

no matter how many points it drains. Temporary hit points

gained in this way last for up to 1 hour. Should a dream vestige

ever acquire a number of temporary hit points equal to its

full normal hit points, it self spawns (see below).

At the beginning of a dream vestiges subsequent action after

a creature has been drained to 0 Intelligence, the victims body

is automatically engulfed and dissolved by the dream vestige,

leaving nothing behind, not even dust.

Frightful Presence (Su): A dream vestige can inspire terror

by charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on

a DC 23 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condi-

tion as long as they remain with 60 feet of the dream vestige.

A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by that

dream vestiges frightful presence for 24 hours. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

De  ective  Aura  (Su):  A  dream  vestige  is  protected  by  a

powerful aura of dream energy. This special aura increases its

AC de ection bonus by 13 (in addition to its incorporeal de ec-

tion bonus of +5), which is already factored into the statistics

above.

Dream  Travel  (Su):  A  dream  vestige  can  pull  itself  fully

into the world of dreams, leaving behind the waking world, as

a standard action. For every minute the vestige moves through

the dream region, it travels 5 miles in the waking world. A dream

vestige can also use this ability to travel across planar borders,

should it desire. A dream vestige always knows where it will

come out in the waking world.

Inescapable Craving: A dream vestige has an inescapable

craving  (see  the  Undead  Metabolism  section  in  Chapter  1)

for bodies, which it satis es by using its form consumption

ability.

Self Spawn (Ex): When a dream vestige gains a number of

temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit point total, it

self spawns, splitting into two identical dream vestiges, each

with  a  number  of  hit  points  equal  to  the  original  dream

vestiges full normal total.

This shrunken and dis gured humanoid carcass moves under the

power of its own animation, though the details of its shape are

blurred beneath a coating of  lth and grave dirt.

Entombers are undead animated by necromancers who prefer

to  leave  the  dirty  work  to  their  servants.  The  entombers  are

perfect  for  putting  bodies  in  the  ground,  or  bringing  them

out,  depending  on  the  needs  of  their  masters.  They  usually

inhabit  cemeteries,  catacombs,  or  other  places  where  many

corpses  might  be  found.  Unless  speci cally  commanded

otherwise, entombers treat all living creatures as subjects for

their entombing power.

Entombers are  lthy, streaked with dirt, and sometimes even

bits of desiccated  esh (not their own), jewelry, and other small

bits taken from the bodies they exhume or entomb. They stink of

both carrion and embalming alchemical  uids. Closer scrutiny

reveals their lips are sewn shut.

Most  entombers  are  about  6  feet  tall  and  weigh  about  160

pounds.

Entombers understand Common, but their lips are sewn shut,

so they cannot speak.

COMBAT

In  melee  combat,  an  entombers  st  is  a  powerful  weapon.

However,  the  fear  associated  with  entombers  is  more  due  to

their ability to entomb foes with their attack.

Entomb (Su): Whenever an entomber succeeds on a slam

attack, it can attempt to entomb its foe. The foe must make a

DC 16 Re ex save or be pounded bodily into a shallow grave.

The  save  DC  is  Charisma-based.  This  ability  doesnt  work  in

locations with a basement or open level immediately below, nor

can the creature entomb victims in magical, living, or animate

materials, or materials with a hardness higher than 8.

The  upthrust  bulge  of  cracked   ooring  material,  earth,  or

stone  reveals  the  location  of  the  victim  to  compatriots.  Two

standard actions spent clearing away the broken  ooring mate-

rial reveals the entombed victim, who can use his or her next

action to stand from a prone (and dusty) position. Attempting

to rescue a friend in this way can provoke

attacks of opportunity.

The victim is treated as if pinned by an

opponent (the earth) with a grappling check

of 20. Breaking free of  rst the pin and then

the grapple allows the victim to stand from

a prone position on his or her next round.

If compatriots of the victim have partially

cleared  away  the  covering  material,  then

the victim need only make a single check

before  standing  from  the  prone  position.

Each  round  the  victim  spends  fully  or

partially entombed is a round in which the

victim suffocates (see Suffocation, page 304

of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Exhume (Su): When an entomber spends

a standard action and touches the top of a

grave or space where a creature is buried no

deeper than 10 feet, the body immediately

rises to the surface, leaving no hole or tunnel.

A body is not harmed when brought to the

surface in this manner.

New feat described on page 27.

A  skeletal  being  cloaked  in  a  great  black

robe  and  head-concealing  hood  holds

a  large  scythe  in  both  hands.

The  head  of  the  scythe  is

an  absence  in  space,

a  blade-shaped  hole

in reality that draws in

Entropic

reaper

the light around it.

Entropic reapers are undead that arise in

Limbo. They enforce the twisted edicts

of chaotic beings that decree the death

of lawful creatures (though an entro-

pic reaper is not particular about the

alignments  of  the  creatures  it  brings

low).  Though  originating  in  Limbo,

entropic reapers spend much of their

time  in  the  Material  Plane,  seeking

to  apply  their  entropic  scythes  to

the necks of the living.

Entropic reapers stand about

6-1/2 feet tall and weigh about

180 pounds.

Entropic  reapers  speak

Common, Abyssal, and

Celestial.

COMBAT

An  entropic  reaper  uses  its  self-

enhanced scythe to wreak terrible

damage on those it decides

must  die  (which  includes

most  creatures  it  happens

to meet).

The  scythe  an  entropic

reaper  wields  is  treated  as

chaotic-aligned  for  the  purpose

of over coming damage reduction.

An entropic reaper normally attacks using its Power Attack

feat, taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus

on damage rolls.

Entropic Blade (Su): An entropic reaper confers the entropic

blade property upon any weapon it wieldsusually a normal

scythe. An entropic blade functions in all ways like the kind of

weapon it is, with the following addition. Any time the entropic

reaper  successfully  deals  damage  with  its  entropic  blade,  the

victim must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or be overcome with

searing  pain,  as  the  victims  form  melts,   ows,  writhes,  and

boils. During this entropic state, the victim cannot cast spells

or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish

friend from foe (4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance,

regardless of the attack roll). Each round spent in this entropic

state, the victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental

shock. If the victims Wisdom score falls to 0,

it discorporates into nothingness.

A  victim  can  gain  control  over  itself  by  taking  a

standard action to attempt a DC 21 Charisma check. Success

renders the victim immune from the entropic state for 1 minute.

On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round

until successful. The entropic state is not a disease or a curse,

so it is hard to remove. A shapechange or stoneskin spell does not

cure an af icted creature but  xes its state for the duration of the

spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the

af iction (though a separate restoration is necessary to restore any

drained points of Wisdom). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Master of the Scythe (Su): The entropic reaper is a master

of the scythe, and gains the ability to wield a weapon one size

larger than normal. It also treats the scythe as if it were a mighty

cleaving  weapon,  which  allows  it  to  make  one  additional

cleave attempt in a round.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayplane shift. Caster level equals

the entropic reapers HD. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

EVOLVED UNDEAD

An evolved undead is an undead whose body is  ushed with

more negative energy than normal due to an exceptionally long

lifetime. Any undead may gain this template, and in doing so, it

retains all its previous abilities, but becomes more powerful

than before.

When  an  intelligent  undead  creature  survives  for  100

years or more (or when the DM decides to create an undead

monster  with  a  twist),  there  is  a  1%  chance  that  its

connection to the Negative Energy Plane grows more

mature.  When  this  evolution  occurs,  the  undead  gains

this template. Each additional 100 years of existence affords

an additional 1% chance of a more mature connection, plus an

additional 1% chance for each previous evolution. For example,

if an undead creatures connection to the Negative Energy Plane

evolved three times previously, it has a 4% chance to gain one

more step of maturation the next time its age requires an evo-

lution check. Every step of evolution means that the evolved

undead template can be applied again to the undead creature

(setting this template apart from most other templates, which

can be applied only once).

Combat

An evolved wraith attacks just like a normal wraith, with a few

extra abilities.

Constitution Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by an evolved

wraiths incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 14 Forti-

tude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. The save DC

is Charisma-based. On each such successful attack, the wraith

gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

Create  Spawn  (Su):  Any  humanoid  slain  by  an  evolved

wraith  becomes  a  wraith  in  1d4  rounds.  Its  body  remains

intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse

and transformed. Spawn are under the command of the wraith

that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do

not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Daylight Powerlessness (Ex): Evolved wraiths are utterly

powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and

 ee from it.

Fast  Healing  (Ex):  An  evolved  wraith  heals  3  points  of

damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.

Spell-Like Ability: 1/dayhaste (self only). Caster level 5th.

Unnatural Aura (Su): Animals, whether wild or domesti-

cated, can sense the unnatural presence of an evolved wraith

at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer

than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as

long as they are within that range.

CREATING AN EVOLVED UNDEAD

Evolved undead is an acquired template that can be added to

any undead with an Intelligence score (referred to hereafter as

the base creature). An evolved undead uses all the base creatures

statistics and special abilities except as noted here. This template

does not alter the creatures type.

Note: Unlike most templates, an evolved undead can poten-

tially acquire this template more than once, evolving more with

each application.

Armor  Class:  The  base  creatures  natural  armor  bonus

improves  by  1.  If  the  creature  is  incorporeal,  its  de ection

bonus to AC improves by 1.

Special Attacks: An evolved undead retains all the special

attacks of the base creature and gains one spell-like ability from

the following list. You can choose this ability from the list below,

or roll randomly. The spell-like ability gained herein can be used

once per day. If the undead already has the indicated ability, it

gains another use; if it already has the ability as an at-will ability,

choose another ability. The spell-like ability has a caster level

equal to the evolved undeads HD (if the caster level is too low

to cast the spell in question, choose another). The save DCs are

Charisma-based:

and +2 Charisma. An evolved incorporeal creature gains only

among those of its base kind.

New feat described on page 27.

Roiling and coiling, this long, slender creature snakes forward.

At  rst, it does seem like a snake, if strangely wide and loose-

skinned, but an instant later the creature is revealed for what

it isan evacuated but horribly animate humanoid skin that

continues  to  slither  onward  in  an  unmistakably  aggressive

manner.

Forsaken shells are what they appear to bethe empty skins

of  past  victims,  purged  of  their  bloody  and  visceral  former

contents.  The  loose  skins  possess  an  amazing  strength  and

elasticity, driven by necromantic lan and a predatory nature

that cannot be denied.

This  creatures  ability  to  strip  a  skin  from  a  victim  and

animate  new  versions  of  itself  is  terrible  enough,  but  far

worse is the accidental discovery of the creatures depreda-

tions before uncovering the creature itself. When a forsaken

shell skulks into a new area, it seeks to hide the evidence of

its predation in out-of-the-way places such as little-opened

GHOST

BRUTE

Ghost  brutes  are  the

spectral  remnants  of

animals, magical beasts,

and sentient plants

creatures  without

the minimum Charis-

ma needed to become

normal  ghosts.  They

drift aimlessly, haunt-

ing  the  places  where

they died and moaning

in endless misery.

Forsaken shell

closets or beneath piles of discarded supplies. Still, sometimes

a telltale finger or toe peeking out from the obscuring barrier

leads to the discovery of tangled, skinless bodies of fellow

friends or family, their dead eyes reflecting their last silent

screams.

Forsaken shells weigh about 20 to 30 pounds.

Forsaken  shells  do  not  speak,  but  they  understand

Common.

COMBAT

Forsaken shells are aggressive, but prefer to strike from secret

against  lone  prey.  However,  even  forsaken  shells,  despite

their lack of form, can feel the need to exact vengeance upon

someone who has harmed or merely threatened other forsaken

shells, especially its spawn. When this happens, they become

implacable  enemies,  willing  to  attack  even  large  groups  of

opponents.

A forsaken shell normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus on

damage rolls.

Constrict (Ex): A forsaken shell deals 1d6+5 points of damage

with a successful grapple check. Constricting uses the entire

body of the creature, so it cannot take any move actions while

constricting.

Create  Spawn  (Su):  Creatures  killed  by  a  forsaken  shell

slough their skins after 1d4 rounds. These sloughed skins are

new forsaken shells under the spawners control. These forsaken

shells do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  forsaken  shell

must  successfully  hit  an  opponent  with  its  skin  slap  attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,

it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Skills: Forsaken shells have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks

(already  gured into the statistics above), due to their ability to

fold themselves into very small spaces.

A  ghost  brute  most

often  results  from  the

same circumstances that caused

its earthly companion or master

to remain after death. It might be

the  mount  of  a  betrayed  paladin,  the

beloved pet of a child tragically killed, the scorched oak of a

ghostly  dryad,  or  a  murdered  druids  animal  companion.  In

most cases, laying the associated being to rest also puts an end

to the ghost brute.

However, sometimes a bizarre circumstance might produce

a ghost brute without an intelligent companion. For example,

a forest suddenly obliterated by an evil magical attack might

remain  as  a  ghostly  grove  populated  by  lingering  spirits  not

even completely aware of their own destruction.

Combat

Against ethereal opponents, a ghost hound can bring to bear

its vicious bite, which also deals 1d6 points of negative energy

damage.

Slavering Doom (Su): A ghost hounds jaws drip with glow-

ing ectoplasmic drool. The ectoplasm dissipates on contact with

nonliving material, but if it touches a living being, that oppo-

nent must make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6

points of negative energy damage. The drool might be delivered

through a bite attack or simply sprayed onto a nearby creature.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Manifestation (Su): As an ethereal creature, a ghost hound

cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world.

When it manifests, the ghost hound becomes visible but remains

incorporeal. A manifested ghost hound remains on the Ethereal

Plane but can be attacked by opponents on both the Material

and Ethereal planes.

Rejuvenation (Su): A ghost hound that would otherwise be

destroyed returns to its old haunts in 2d4 days with a successful

level check (1d20 + 2) against DC 16. A ghost hound is tied more

closely to other beings than more intelligent spirits. Often it

is the companion of a ghostly being, but it may also become

fascinated with or enraged by a living creature that intrudes

on its domain. It always returns to the object of its attachment

rather than to a set location.

Skills: A ghost hound gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

Search, and Spot checks. It also has a +8 racial bonus on Survival

A ghost brute hound

checks  when  tracking

by scent. (These bonuses are already factored into the statistics

above.)

CREATING A GHOST BRUTE

Ghost brute is an acquired template that can be added to any

animal, magical beast, or plant with a Charisma score below 8

(hereafter referred to as the base creature). The creature follows

the rules for ghosts (as described in the Monster Manual) except

as noted here.

Size  and  Type:  The  creatures  type  changes  to  undead

(augmented animal, magical beast, or plant), and it gains the

incorporeal and augmented subtypes. Do not recalculate base

attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

Speed: A ghost brute has a  y speed of 30 feet (unless the base

creature has a higher  y speed), with perfect maneuverability.

AC: Natural armor bonus is the same as the base creatures

but  applies  only  to  ethereal  encounters.  When  a  ghost  brute

manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus is +0, but as an

incorporeal  creature,  it  gains  a  de ection  bonus  equal  to  its

Charisma modi er or +1, whichever is higher.

Attacks:  A  ghost  brute  retains  all  the  attacks  of  the  base

creature,  although  those  relying  on  physical  contact  do  not

affect nonethereal creatures.

Damage: Against ethereal creatures, a ghost brute uses the

base creatures damage ratings. Against nonethereal creatures,

a ghost brute usually cannot deal physical damage at all but can

use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests (see below).

Special Attacks: A ghost brute retains all the special attacks

of the base creature, although those relying on physical contact

do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost brute also gains

one special attack selected from the list below. Saves have a DC

of 10 + 1/2 ghost brutes HD + ghost brutes Cha modi er unless

otherwise noted.

Bloodcurdling  Howl  (Su):  The  mournful  howling  of  a  ghost

brute  chills  the  living  to  the  core.  The  creature  can  howl  as

a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot radius

must make a successful Will save or become frightened for 2d4

rounds; those more than 30 feet away but within 300 feet must

make a Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. This is a

sonic, necromantic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that

successfully saves against the bloodcurdling howl cannot be

affected by the same ghost brutes howl for 24 hours.

Corrupting Touch (Su): A ghost brute that hits a living target

with its corrupting touch attack deals 1d4 points of damage.

Against  ethereal  opponents,  it  adds  its  Strength  modi er  to

attack  rolls  and  damage  rolls.  Against  material  opponents,  it

adds its Dexterity modi er to attack rolls only.

Loom (Su): A ghost brute can make itself more intimidating by

exaggerating its natural size. It can appear up to two sizes larger

than normal for a total of 10 minutes each day (the time need not

be continuous). This enlargement is illusory; the creatures attack

bonus and Armor Class remain unchanged. However, a ghost

brute gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Intimidate

checks while enlarged.

Slavering Doom (Su): A ghost brutes jaws drip with a glowing

ectoplasmic drool that exists in both ethereal and corporeal form.

The ectoplasm dissipates on contact with nonliving material, but

if it touches a living being, that opponent must make a successful

Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of negative energy damage. The

drool can be delivered through a bite attack against an ethereal

opponent, or a melee touch attack against an opponent on the

Material Plane. Alternatively, the drool can simply be sprayed

onto a nearby creature as a ranged touch attack.

Special Qualities: A ghost brute gains the three special

qualities described below.

Manifestation (Su): As ethereal creatures,

ghost brutes cannot affect or be affected

by anything in the material world. When

they manifest, ghost brutes become vis-

ible  but  remain  incorporeal.  However,

a  manifested  ghost  brute

can  strike  with  a  touch

attack,  if  it  has  one,  or

a  ghost  touch  weapon

(if it can wield a weap-

on). A manifested ghost

brute remains on the Ethe-

real Plane but can be attacked

by opponents on both the Ma-

terial and Ethereal planes.

A gravetouched

ghoul

Rejuvenation  (Su):  In  most  cases,

it  is  dif cult  to  destroy  a  ghost

brute  through  simple  combat.  The

destroyed  spirit  often  restores  itself

in 2d4 days. A ghost brute that would

otherwise be destroyed returns to its

old  haunts  with  a  successful  level

check  (1d20  +  ghost  brutes  HD)

against  DC  16.  As  a  rule,  the  only

de nitive  way  to  get  rid  of  a  ghost

brute is to determine the reason for

its existence and set right whatever

prevents  it  from  resting  in  peace.

The  exact  means  varies  with  each

spirit  and  may  require  a  good  deal

of research.

Unlike  other  more  intelligent

spirits, a ghost brute is usually tied

more  closely  to  other  beings.  Often  it  is  the  companion  of  a

ghostly being, but it may also become fascinated with or enraged

by a living creature that intrudes on its domain. It always returns

to the object of its attachment rather than to a set location.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A ghost brute has +2 turn resistance.

Abilities: Same as the base creatures, except that the ghost

brute has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases

by 8. It has no Strength score for the purpose of  ghting crea-

tures on the Material Plane, but its Strength score is the same

as the base creatures against ethereal opponents.

Skills: A ghost brute has a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

Search, and Spot checks.

Organization: Solitary or with associated ghost, or same as

the base creature.

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +2.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Usually neutral.

Level Adjustment: +5.

GRAVETOUCHED GHOUL

Like traditional ghouls, gravetouched ghouls haunt graveyards,

battle elds, and other places rich with the carrion for which

they hunger. These terrible creatures lurk wherever the stench

of death hangs heavy, ready to devour the unwary.

Ghouls are said to be created upon the death of a living

sentient being who savored the taste of the

 esh of other sentient creatures. This asser-

tion may or may not be true, but it does

explain the disgusting behavior of these

anthropophagous  undead.  Some

believe  that  anyone  of  exceptional

debauchery  and  wickedness  runs

the risk of becoming a gravetouched

ghoul.  The  transformation  from

living  beings  into  fell  creatures

of the night has warped their

minds,  making  them  cun-

ning and feral.

While  most  humanoids

who  engage  in  such  activ-

ities  and  return  from  the

grave  are  mere  ghouls  (as

described  in  the  Monster

Manual),  in  rare  occasions

the creation of a ghoul brie y

draws the attention of Doresain,

King of the Ghouls. When this

happens,  the  newly  formed

ghoul  does  not  possess  the

standard Monster Manual sta-

tistics for a ghoul, but instead

the base creature gains this

gravetouched  ghoul

template. These tem-

plated  creatures  are

said  to  be  touched  by

the King. The DM decides

when this occurs.

CREATING A GRAVETOUCHED GHOUL

Gravetouched ghoul is an acquired template that can be added

to any corporeal aberration, fey, giant, humanoid, or monstrous

humanoid with Intelligence and Charisma scores of 3 or higher

(referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A gravetouched ghoul speaks all the languages it spoke in

life (usually Common). It has all the base creatures statistics

and special abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead, and

it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack

bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

Armor  Class:  The  base  creatures  natural  armor  bonus

improves by 2.

Attack: A gravetouched ghoul retains all the attacks of the

base  creature  and  also  gains  a  bite  and  two  claw  attacks  if  it

didnt already have them. If the base creature uses weapons, the

gravetouched ghoul retains this ability. A creature with natural

weapons retains those natural weapons. A gravetouched ghoul

 ghting without weapons uses its bite attack. A gravetouched

ghoul  armed  with  a  weapon  uses  its  bite  or  weapon  as  it

desires.

Full Attack: A gravetouched ghoul  ghting without weapons

uses its bite and two claws to attack. If armed with a weapon, it

chooses whether to use the weapon or use its natural attacks.

Damage: Gravetouched ghouls have bite and claw attacks.

If  the  base  creature  does  not  have  this  attack  form,  use  the

appropriate  damage  value  from  the  table  below  according  to

the gravetouched ghouls size. Creatures that have other kinds

of natural weapons retain their old damage values or use the

COMBAT

No one likes to be hit by a grave dirt golem because its  lth fouls

the wounds of its enemies.

Berserk  (Ex):  When  a  grave  dirt  golem  enters  combat,

there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental

spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk. An uncontrolled

golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature

or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is

within  reach,  then  moving  on  to  spread  more  destruction.

Once a grave dirt golem goes berserk, no known method can

reestablish control.

Construct  Traits:  A  grave  dirt  golem  has  immunity  to

poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities

Paralysis (Ex): Victims hit by a gravetouched ghouls bite or claw

attack must make a successful Fortitude save or be paralyzed for

1d4+1 rounds. Elves have immunity to this paralysis.

TOMBSTONE GOLEM

A stone golem becomes a tombstone golem with the following

substitutions. Rather than simple stone, the creature is made

up of fused grave headstones, inscribed with names in various

languages, often more than one name per headstone, along with

birth and death dates. Second, its supernatural ability to slow

opponents is replaced by the slay living ability. Finally, increase

the Challenge Rating by 2. Substitute slay living (see below) for

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Slay Living (Su): A tombstone golem can deliver a slay living

effect, as the spell, in conjunction with a normal melee attack

every 2 rounds. The effect slays those who fail a DC 17 Fortitude

save, or deals 3d6+14 points of damage even on a successful

save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Immunity  to  Magic  (Ex):  A

grave dirt golem is immune to spells,

spell-like  abilities,  and  supernatural

effects, just as if the attacker had

failed  to  overcome  spell  resis-

tance. The only exceptions are

as follows: A move earth spell

drives  the  grave  dirt  golem

back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points

of damage. A disintegrate spell slows the

golem  (as  the  slow  spell)  for  1d6  rounds

and deals 1d12 points of damage.

An earthquake spell cast directly

at  a  grave  dirt  golem  stops  it

from  moving  on  its  next  turn

and deals 5d10 points of damage.

The golem receives no saving throw

against any of these effects.

Any magical attack against

a grave dirt golem that deals

electricity  damage  heals  1

point  of  damage  for  every  3

points of damage it would other-

wise deal. If the amount

of  healing  would

cause  the  golem  to

exceed  its  full  normal

hit  points,  it  gains  any

excess  as  temporary  hit

points  that  last  for  up  to  1

hour. A grave earth golem receives no

saving throw against magical attacks that deal

electricity damage.

HALF-VAMPIRE

In rare circumstances, a vampire that has recently consumed a

signi cant quantity of blood gains the ability to breed success-

fully with living humanoids or monstrous humanoids, creating

half-vampire offspring. Also, in the unusual case of a pregnant

humanoid or monstrous humanoid who survives

a  vampires  blood  drain  attack,  the  child

may be born tainted by the attackers

vampirism. Regardless of the origin,

the children produced by such

events are typically branded

as  outcasts,  welcome  nei-

ther  among  the  living  or

the  undead.

A half-vampire is drawn

to other living creatures, and

feels  far  more  comfortable

when  living  in  towns  or  cit-

ies.  Still,  half-vampires  know

that they must keep their iden-

tities secret or else risk the hatred

and violence of others.

Half-vampires  are  often

physically attractive and per-

suasive.  Their  skin  is  pale,

even ashen in color.

Unlike their undead fore-

bears, half-vampires enjoy

the freedom (or curse) of pur-

suing any alignment,

though  most  tend

toward  neutrality  or

evil.  Those  rare  few

good-aligned  half-vam-

pires often feel haunted

by their heritage, some-

times  working  to  undo

the evil of their ancestry.

This  example  uses  a  1st-level

Soiled  Wound  (Ex):  The  wound  in icted  by  a  grave  dirt

golem is caked with grave dirt. Suffused with negative energy,

the soiled wound deals an extra 2d4 points of negative energy

The hyena-headed  gure standing before you has a particularly

feral appearance, its muscular hands clenched tightly around a

greataxe.

Combat

This half-vampire uses stealth to approach its prey, then attack-

ing savagely with its greataxe. It typically drains blood only from

unconscious or otherwise helpless foes.

A half-vampires natural weapons are treated as magic weapons

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Blood Drain (Ex): This half-vampire can suck blood from

a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple

check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of

Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. It cant

drain  more  points  of  Constitution  in  a  single  hour  than  its

Constitution  score.  When  a  half-vampire  drains  a  victims

Constitution, it gains 5 temporary hit points, no matter how

many points it drains. Temporary hit points gained in this way

last for up to 1 hour.

Blood Dependency (Ex): If a half-vampire does not use its

blood drain special attack against at least one living creature each

day, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become fatigued.

Each day after the  rst that the half-vampire does not drink

blood directly from a living creature, the DC increases by 1 until

it fails the save and becomes fatigued. After that, it must make

a DC 20 Fortitude save each week (with the DC increasing by

1 each week thereafter) that it does not use its blood drain or

become exhausted.

The fatigue or exhaustion caused by blood dependency cannot

be eliminated by rest (though magic can offset the condition

until the vampire fails another save). Using its blood drain abil-

ity eliminates a half-vampires fatigue immediately, or reduces

exhaustion to fatigue.

Fast Healing (Ex): A half-vampire heals 1 point of damage

each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point but less than half

its full normal hit points. As long as the vampire has more than

half its full normal hit points, its fast healing does not function

(but other forms of healing still function normally).

Rage (Ex): Once per day, a half-vampire gnoll barbarian can

enter a state of  erce rage that lasts for 6 rounds. The following

changes last as long as it rages: hp 24; AC 16, touch 9,  at-footed

13; Grp ++5/+7; Atk or Full Atk +7 melee (1d12+7 greataxe) or

+7 (1d6+5 slam); SV Fort +8; Str 21, Con 17.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  This  half-vampire  gnoll  barbarian

retains  its  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC  even  when   at-footed  or

targeted by an unseen foe (it still loses its Dexterity bonus if

paralyzed or otherwise immobile).

Skills: This half-vampire gnoll barbarian has a +2 racial bonus

on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks (already

calculated into the statistics above).

Possessions: +2 leather armor, greataxe.

CREATING A HALF-VAMPIRE

Half-vampire is an inherited template that can be added to any

humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the

base creature). The creatures size and type do not change.

A half-vampire uses all the base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Armor Class: A half-vampires natural armor bonus improves

by 2.

Attack: A half-vampire retains all the attacks of the base

creature and also gains a slam attack if it didnt already have

one. If the base creature can use weapons, the half-vampire

retains this ability. A creature with natural weapons retains

those natural weapons. A half-vampire  ghting without weap-

ons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if

it has one). A half-vampire armed with a weapon uses its slam

or a weapon, as it desires. A half-vampires natural weapons

are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Full Attack: A half-vampire  ghting without weapons uses

either its slam attack (see above) or its natural weapons (if it has

one). If armed with a weapon, it usually uses the weapon as its

primary attack along with a slam or other natural weapon as a

natural secondary attack.

Damage: A half-vampire has a slam attack. If the base crea-

ture does not have this attack form, use the appropriate damage

value from the table below according to the half-vampires size.

Creatures that have other kinds of natural weapons retain their

old damage values or use the appropriate value from the table

below, whichever is better.

Special Attacks: A half-vampire retains all the special attacks

of the base creature and gains one of those described below.

Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 half-vampires HD + half-vampires

Cha modi er unless otherwise noted.

Blood Drain (Ex): Some half-vampires can suck blood from a

living victim with their fangs by making a successful grapple

check. If the half-vampire pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing

1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is main-

tained. A half-vampire cant drain more points of Constitution in

a single hour than its Constitution score. When a half-vampire

drains a victims Constitution, it gains 5 temporary hit points,

no  matter  how  many  points  it  drains.  Temporary  hit  points

gained in this way last for up to 1 hour. If a half-vampire has

this ability, it also gains the blood dependency special quality

described below.

Charm Gaze (Su): Some half-vampires can charm humanoid

or monstrous humanoid opponents just by looking into their

eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the half-vampire

must use a standard action, and those merely looking at the

half-vampire are not affected. Anyone the half-vampire targets

must make a successful Will save or fall under the half-vampires

in uence as though affected by a charm monster spell (caster

level equal to HD). Any creature that successfully saves against

a half-vampires charm gaze cannot be affected by that half-

vampires charm gaze for 24 hours. The ability has a range of

30 feet.

Children of the Night (Su): Some half-vampires can command

the lesser creatures of the world. Once per day, a half-vampire

that has this special attack can call forth 1d4 rat swarms, 1d3

bat swarms, or a pack of 1d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the

base creature is not terrestrial, this ability might summon other

creatures of equivalent power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6

rounds and serve the half-vampire for up to 1 hour.

Special  Qualities:  A  half-vampire  retains  all  the  special

qualities  of  the  base  creature  and  also  gains  those  described

below.

Blood Dependency (Ex): If a half-vampire does not use its blood

drain special attack against at least one living creature each day,

it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Each

day after the  rst that the half-vampire does not drink blood

directly from a living creature, the DC increases by 1 until it

fails the save and becomes fatigued. After that, it must make a

DC 20 Fortitude save each week (with the DC increasing by

1 each week thereafter) that it does not use its blood drain or

become exhausted.

The fatigue or exhaustion caused by blood dependency cannot

be eliminated by rest (though magic can offset the condition

until the vampire fails another save). Using its blood drain abil-

ity eliminates a half-vampires fatigue immediately, or reduces

exhaustion to fatigue.

Only half-vampires with the blood drain special attack (see

above) gain this special quality.

Hooded pupils usually are found serving an apprenticeship

with a more powerful intelligent undead. The undead master

sometimes has need for living servants to advance its ends in

societies of the living. On the other hand, the living pupil sees

 rsthand what it means to fully embrace the darkness.

Hooded  pupils  are  usually  only  created  when  a  powerful

undead bequeaths a secret of necromancy to one who accepts

its truth. As testament to their apprenticeship, hooded pupils are

most often dressed in some sort of ominous hooded mantle.

A smell like an open grave heralds this hulking  gure. It is draped

in  ominous  black  folds,  its  features  lost  beneath  a  night-dark

hood wide enough to conceal more than a single head.

COMBAT

A hooded pupil ettin relishes its heightened abilities in combat,

usually beginning any con ict with its clutch of Orcus ability.

Once threats are dealt with, it attempts to drink the blood of

any smaller enemy it can grapple.

Clutch of Orcus (Sp): Once per day, a hooded pupil can use

the spell clutch of Orcus (see page 63). Caster level 10th. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

Spider Climb (Su): A hooded pupil ettin can climb sheer

surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.

Superior  Two-Weapon  Fighting  (Ex):  A  hooded  pupil

ettin  ghts with a morningstar or javelin in each hand. Because

each of its two heads controls an arm, the ettin does not take a

penalty on attack rolls or damage rolls for attacking with two

weapons.

Skills: An ettins two heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Listen,

Spot, and Search checks. As a hooded pupil, the creature also

gains  an  additional  +2  racial  bonus  on  Hide,  Listen,  Move

Silently, and Spot checks.

CREATING A HOODED PUPIL

Hooded pupil is an acquired template that can be added to any

corporeal giant or humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base

creature). The creatures size and type do not change.

A hooded pupil uses all the base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

skin thickens into an all-encompassing yellow callus, granting

the  base  creature  an  improvement  of  +2  to  its  natural  armor

bonus.

Special Attacks: A hooded pupil retains all the base creatures

special attacks and gains those described below.

Clutch of Orcus (Sp): Once per day, a hooded pupil can use the

spell clutch of Orcus (see page 63). Caster level 10th. The save DC

is Charisma-based.

Drink Blood (Su): Once per day, a hooded pupil can suck blood

from a living victim who has damage that is yet unhealed (the

hooded pupil doesnt have exceptionally sharp teeth, unless the

base creature has a bite attack, so it must sip from wounds). It

does so by making a successful grapple check (it usually prefers

to use this ability on foes that are already helpless). Against

a pinned or helpless foe, it drinks blood, dealing 2 points of

Constitution damage.

Special  Qualities:  A  hooded  pupil  retains  all  the  special

qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.

Resistance to Cold (Ex): Hooded pupils gain resistance to

cold 5.

Spider Climb (Su): Hooded pupils can climb sheer

Tramping  out  of  the  night  is  a

dreadful giant corpse. For all that its eyes are lifeless and devoid

of mind, the creatures gaze still promises swift death to any that

it can catch and crush in its mighty grip.

Any undead army would be happy to recruit a hulking corpse.

Its raw power combined with its mindless devotion to whatever

master is powerful enough to command it ensures a swift vic-

tory over lesser foes. Of course, few can command a hulking

corpse.  Thus,  these  creatures  are  often  found  wandering  the

night, seeking only to crush, destroy, and rend.

COMBAT

A hulking corpse never employs subtlety or strategy. It bulls in,

attempting to grab and rend its foes until they cease moving.

A hulking corpse normally attacks using its Power Attack feat,

taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5 bonus on

damage rolls.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a hulking corpse

must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Mindless  (Ex):  Hulking  corpses  are  mindless,  having  no

Intelligence score, so they do not have any skills. A hulking

corpse is immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Rend (Ex): A hulking corpse that wins a grapple check after

a successful claw attack establishes a hold, latching onto the

opponents body and tearing the  esh. This attack deals an extra

3d6+12 points of damage.

MUMMIFIED

CREATURE

Mummies are undead creatures, em-

balmed using ancient necromantic

lore. Often set as guardians for sa-

cred sites, mummies defend their

charges  until  destroyed.  Should

a  mummy  be  unable  to  defend  its

charge  for  any  reason,  it  becomes

an unreasoning spirit of vengeance,

hunting those who desecrated the site

it was tasked to defend.

A  mummy  appears  withered  and

desiccated, its features hidden beneath

centuries-old funereal wrappings. It

moves with a slow, shambling gait

and groans with the weight of

the ages. Symbols of the deity

it  once  served  often  mark

these  horrid  creatures.

While  other  undead  stink

of  carrion,  the  herbs  and

powders  used  to  create  a

mummy  give  off  a  sharp,

pungent  odor,  like  that  of

a spice cabinet.

In melee combat, a mummi ed ogre delivers a powerful blow.

Even  if  it  had  no  other  abilities,  its  great  strength  and  grim

determination would make it a formidable opponent.

Despair (Su): At the mere sight of a mummi ed ogre, the

viewer must make a DC 12 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for

1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature

cannot be affected again by that mummi ed ogres despair abil-

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot persists until the victim

reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described in the

template description below. An af icted creature that dies shrivels

away into dust that blows away into nothing at the  rst wind.

CREATING A

MUMMIFIED CREATURE

Mummi ed creature is an acquired template that can be added

to  any  corporeal  giant,  humanoid,  or  monstrous  humanoid

(referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A mummi ed creature speaks all the languages it spoke in

life, and it has all the base creatures characteristics except as

noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead, and

it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack

bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.

Hit Dice: Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12.

Speed: A mummi ed creatures land speed decreases by 10

Mummy  Rot  (Su):  Supernatural  disease

Con and 1d6 Cha.

Unlike  normal  diseases,  mummy

rot  persists  until  the  victim  reaches

Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as

described below.

Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural

disease. A character attempting to cast any conju-

ration (healing) spell on a creature af icted with

mummy rot must make a DC 20 caster level check, or else the

spell has no effect on the af icted character.

To  eliminate  mummy  rot,  the  curse  must   rst  be  broken

with  break  enchantment  or  remove  curse  (requiring

a  DC  20  caster  level  check  for  either  spell),  after

which a caster level check is no longer necessary to

cast healing spells on the victim, and the mummy rot

can be magically cured as any normal disease.

An af icted creature that dies of mummy rot

shrivels away into sand that blows away into nothing

at the  rst wind.

Special Qualities: A mum-

MUMMIFIED

CHARACTERS

The process of becoming a mummy is usu-

ally involuntary, but expressing the wish to

become a mummy to the proper priests (and

paying the proper fees) can convince them

to bring you back to life as a mummyespe-

cially if some of your friends make sure the

priests do what you paid them to do. The

mummy retains all class abilities it had in

life, provided that its new ability scores

still allow it to use them (a wizard loses

access to some spell levels, for instance).

A loss of Intelligence does not retroac-

tively remove skill points from a mummi ed

creature.

A mummi ed character has the favored

class it had in life, unless it is unable to con-

tinue in that class because of a change in

ability score or alignment. In such a case,

 ghter becomes  its favored class.

The wavering silhouette of a humanoid

materializes.  Its  reaching,  half-seen

hand threatens to snag your soul.

A murk is an incorporeal, free-roam-

ing  blot  of  undead  essence  with  a

nugget of sentience. It exists to spread

gloom and, when possible, drain life

energy.

Most murks are no more than 6 feet

tall. They cannot speak intelligibly.

COMBAT

Murks  haunt  tombs,  crypts,  cem-

eteries,  and  other  places  where

undead roam.

Confer  Negative  Level  (Su):

Any humanoid reduced to Wisdom

0 by a murk (see Wisdom damage,

below)  gains  one  negative  level.

The  DC  is  12  for  the  Fortitude

save  to  remove  a  negative  level.

The  save  DC  is  Charisma-based.

When  a  murk  bestows  a  nega-

tive level on a victim, it gains 5

temporary  hit  points  (10

on  a  critical  hit).  These

temporary  hit  points  last

for up to 1 hour.

A  murk  that  bestows

a negative level on a 1 HD creature kills the creature, which

becomes  a  murk  under  the  control  of  its  killer  within  1d4

rounds.

Inescapable Craving: A murk has an inescapable craving

(see the Undead Metabolism section in Chapter 1) for Wisdom

and life force, which it satis es by using its Wisdom damage

and confer negative level abilities.

Wisdom Damage (Su): The touch of a murk deals 1d6 points

of Wisdom damage to a living foe.

NECROMENTAL

A necromental is the undead remnant of an elemental creature.

It retains only a fraction of the self-awareness that the elemental

had in life, but it becomes twisted and evil.

SAMPLE NECROMENTAL

This  example  uses  a  Large  earth  elemental  as  the  base

creature.

This walking pile of crumbling earth and stone radiates a pal-

pable aura of death.

Earth Mastery (Ex): An earth necromental gains a +1 bonus

on attack rolls and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touch-

ing the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the

necromental takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls.

(These modi ers are not already calculated into the statistics

above.)

Elemental Traits: An earth necromental has immunity to

poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject

to critical hits or  anking. It cannot be raised, reincarnated, or

resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrec-

tion spell can restore life).

Energy  Drain  (Su):  Living  creatures  hit  by  an  earth

necromentals natural weapon attack gain one negative level.

An earth necromental can use its energy drain ability once per

round. The save to remove the negative level 24 hours later has

a DC of 14. When an earth necromental bestows a negative level

on a victim, it gains 5 temporary hit points (10 on a critical hit).

These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.

Fast Healing (Ex): An earth necromental heals 3 points of

damage each round as long as it has at least 1 hit point and is

within 5 feet of earth, stone, or metal.

Push  (Ex):  An  earth  necromental  can  start  a  bull  rush

maneuver  without  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity.  The

combat modi ers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to

the necromentals opposed Strength checks.

CREATING A NECROMENTAL

Necromental  is  an  acquired  template  that  can  be  added  to

any  elemental  (referred  to  hereafter  as  the  base  creature).  A

necromental uses all the base creatures statistics, attacks, and

special abilities except as noted here.

Combat

An earth necromental smashes into combat like a typical earth

elemental, though with even more devastating results, thanks

to its energy drain ability.

Create  Spawn  (Su):  An  elemental  slain  by  a

necromentals energy drain attack (see below) rises

as a necromental 1d4 days after death.

Earth Glide (Ex): An earth necromental

Size  and  Type:  The  base  creatures

NECROPOLITAN

Necropolitans are humanoids who renounce life and

embrace undeath in a special ritual called the

Ritual of Crucimigration (see below).

A necropolitans skin is dry, withered, and

powdery. Its eyes are as pale as driven snow, and

as lifeless. It continues to dress in the fashion

it  preferred  while  living.  Necropolitans  are

considered  citizens  of  the  little-known  city

of Nocturnus, but if their nature is revealed

elsewhere,  they  are  feared  and  hunted  like

common monsters.

CREATING A NECROPOLITAN

Necropolitan  is  an  acquired  template  that  can  be  added  to

any humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter

as the base creature).

A necropolitan speaks any languages it knew in life, and it

has all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except

as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead, and

it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate base attack

bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

Special  Qualities:  A  necropolitan  retains  all  the  special

qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.

Resist Control (Ex): Necropolitans have a +2 profane bonus on their

Will saving throws to resist the effect of a control undead spell.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A necropolitan has +2 turn resistance.

Unnatural  Resilience  (Ex):  Necropolitans  automatically  heal

hit point damage and ability damage at the same rate as a living

creature. The Heal skill has no effect on necropolitans; however,

negative energy (such as an in ict spell) heals them.

Abilities: Same as the base creature, except that as undead

creatures, necropolitans have no Constitution score.

Advancement: By character class.

Level Adjustment: Same as the base creature. (Becoming a

necropolitan involves losing a levelsee Ritual of Crucimigra-

tion, belowso the advantages of the undead type cancel out

what would other wise be a larger adjustment.)

Ritual of Crucimigration

Any living humanoid or monstrous humanoid can petition for

consideration to undergo the Ritual of Crucimigration, which

(if successful) enables the creature to become a necropolitan.

The petition for consideration requires a fee of 3,000 gp and a

written plea.

The Ritual: The  rst part of the ritual requires the placement

of the petitioner on a standing pole. Cursed nails are used to af x

the petitioner, and then the pole is lifted into place. The resultant

excruciating pain that shoots like molten metal through the

petitioners  ngers  and  up  the  arms  is  not  what   nally  ends

the petitioners mortal life, however, since death usually comes

from asphyxiation and heart failure. As petitioners feel deaths

chill enter their bodies, many have second thoughts, but it is far

too late to go backthe cursed nails and chanting of the ritual

ensures that the Crucimigration is completed.

The ceremony that lasts for 24 hoursthe usual time it takes

for the petitioner to perish. During this period, two or three

zombie servitors keep up a chant initiated by the ritual leader

when the petitioner is  rst placed into position. Upon hearing

the petitioners last breath, the ritual leader calls forth the names

of evil powers and gods to forge a link with the Negative Energy

Plane, and then impales the petitioner. Dying, the petitioner is

reborn as a necropolitan, dead but animate.

Game Effect: Immediately upon opening its undead eyes, a

new necropolitan loses a level as if the spell raise dead had been

used on it and it was alive instead of animate. (If the subject

has no levels to lose, it is simply destroyed.) It then also loses

an additional 1,000 XP. If the loss of this much XP forces the

necropolitan to lose another level, then it loses another level. No

spell, not even restoration, can restore this lost XP. Petitioners

may not spend experience points they dont haveif the level

New feat described on page 27.

Soft and putrescent, this creatures form is wrapped in tight circles

of cloth, though bloated, swollen tissue still seeps through. The

odor of this creature goes beyond the stink of carrion; the putrefac-

tion of its body is like a physical force that moves before it.

Plague blights are animated corpses of humanoids who died

from plague or rot. In undeath, they seek to putrefy all that is

pure. They are wily and may attempt to trick their victims into

allowing themselves get close enough to touch.

Plague blights speak whatever languages they spoke before

being claimed by plague, plus Common.

COMBAT

In melee combat, the stench of a plague blight sickens its oppo-

nents. Far worse is its touch, which brings on a terrible wasting

disease in its victims, rotting the  esh in seconds and sending

tendrils of dead  esh ever inward toward the heart.

A plague blights natural weapons, as well as any

weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned

for  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Gangrenous Stench (Ex): When-

ever a plague blight desires, it causes

its horrible odor of rot to emanate from

the  folds  of  its  wrappings.  All  living

creatures  within  10  feet  of  the  plague

blight must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or

take 1d6 points of Strength damage and become

nauseated. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Gangrenous Touch (Su): Supernatural disease

(accelerated)slam, Fortitude DC 15, incuba-

tion period instant; damage 1d4 Con. Unlike

normal diseases (see Disease, page 292 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide), gangrenous touch

requires  a  saving  throw  every  round.  It

visibly progresses over a period of seconds,

turning  the  af icted  area  putrescent  and

gangrenous.  The  rot  continues  until  the

victim makes two successful saving throws

in a row, the victim reaches Constitution 0

(and dies), or the victim receives a remove

disease  spell  or  similar  treatment.  Once  it

is infected or it successfully saves, a creature

cant be infected by gangrenous touch again

for 24 hours.

The  body  of  a  victim  claimed  by  gangrenous

touch sloughs into a brittle, stinking mass of putres-

cent ruin that molders to nothing over the course of

24 hours, unless remove disease is cast on the remains

within that time.

Resistant to Blows (Ex): Physical attacks deal only half damage

to a plague blight. Apply this effect before damage reduction.

Two   ery  green  eyes  glare

from  a  shrouded,  half-

real  visage  of  this  vaguely

humanoid  shade.  Either  it  is

dressed  in  robes,  or  its  ectoplasmic   esh  is

naturally loose and  owing. Dark symbols hang in

the air just above and about its form, free-standing

glyphs that viscerally demonstrate the creatures

anathema to all things divine.

Quells are incorporeal creatures of malevo-

lence and the night. They despise all living

things,  as  well  as  the  light  that  nurtures

them,  but  the  urge  that  truly  drives

them  is  their  hatred  of  those  who

serve deities.

If they could, quells would commit

deicide, though of course such actions

are far beyond a quells power. However,

while a quell cannot directly affect a deity,

it does have a power over the connection between

a deity and its followers.

Because of their powers, quells are sought out by

bands of more powerful undead or necromancers.

A quell is about as tall as a human, and is weight-

less.

Quells speak Common and Infernal.

COMBAT

Quells are poor combatants. Their power lies in their ability to

break connections between clerics and their deities.

Coupled Intercession (Su): Whenever a quell takes a stan-

dard action to aid another quell in an intercession attempt, the

effective cleric level of the quell increases by 1. Several quells

could all take standard actions to aid a single quells interces-

sion attempt, each increasing the effective cleric level of the

intercession attempt.

Daylight Powerlessness (Ex): Quells are utterly powerless

in  natural  sunlight  (not  merely  a  daylight  spell)  and   ee

from it.

Intercession (Su): A quell can cut divine spellcasters

off from their source of power. To do so, the quell makes

a turning check as if it were a cleric of a level equal to

the quells Hit Dice (5th level). The result indicates the

highest-level divine spellcasters the quell can cut off from their

deity. The turning damage result indicates the maximum total

Hit Dice of divine spellcasters within 60 feet the ability can affect.

The quells intercession affects the closest divine spellcasters it

can  affect   rst.  Normally,  affected  divine  spellcasters  cannot

turn undead or cast divine spells for 1 minute; however, if the

quell has twice as many HD as the spellcaster has divine levels,

the divine spellcaster loses the ability to cast divine spells for

24 hours. If the quell attacks an affected divine spellcaster in

any way, or the affected spellcaster receives an atonement spell,

the intercession ends. The quells allies and other creatures can

attack the divine spellcaster without breaking the intercession.

A quell can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3

+ its Charisma modi er ( ve times for a typical creature).

An empty set of clothing, dingy and stained,  ings itself forward,

Raiment

A raiment is the clothing of a victim of some atrocious crime,

animated by the spirit of the vengeful victim, mindlessly intent

on  using  its  only  remaining  tool  to  cause  as  much  pain  and

suffering as its long-missing  esh felt in death.

The clothing sometimes retains other personal belongings

of  its  former  owners  as  well.  Different  raiments  may  appear

in different styles of dress, but most require a suf cient mass

of clothing to give them a shape and the ability to wrap their

sleeves around the necks of prospective victims.

A raiment weighs 10 to 20 pounds and does not speak.

COMBAT

A raiment sometimes lies quiescent, like a pile of cast-off rags,

attacking only when its victims are close enough to surprise.

Constrict (Ex): A raiment deals 1d2+3 points of damage with

a successful grapple check against a Large or smaller creature,

in addition to the normal 1d2+3 points of damage for its regular

attack. Because it wraps itself around its victims neck, a creature

in the raiments grasp cannot speak or cast spells that have verbal

components.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a raiment must hit a

Large or smaller opponent with a coat sleeve attack. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

attacks of opportunity. A raiment is hard to grapple because

of its body con guration, so it gains a +4 bonus on its grapple

checks (already  gured into the statistics above). If it wins the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Mindless  (Ex):  A  raiment  is  mindless,  so  it  has  no  Intel-

ligence  score  and  no  feats  or  skills.  A  raiment  is  immune  to

mind-affecting spells and abilities.

REVIVED FOSSIL

Revived fossils are the remains of animals or monsters that were

preserved in a petri ed state. Fossils are found encased in stone

or other geological deposits, but revived fossils are the freed and

animated remains of the dead. They are mindless automatons

that obey the orders of their evil masters.

A revived fossil does only what it is ordered to do. It can draw

no conclusions of its own and takes no initiative. Because of this

limitation, its instructions must always be simple, such as Kill

anyone who walks down this road. A revived fossil attacks until

destroyed, for that is what it was created to do.

Revived fossils cannot be created with the animate dead spell,

but instead are created through special necromantic rituals that

vary depending on the fossil to be revived.

CREATING A REVIVED FOSSIL

Revived fossil is an acquired template that can be added to any

corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal

system (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A revived fossil has all the base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Size  and  Type:  The  creatures  type  changes  to  undead.  It

retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes (such as good)

and subtypes that indicate kind (such as goblinoid or reptilian).

It also gains the augmented subtype.

Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from experience and

raise remaining Hit Dice to d12s.

Speed: Winged revived fossils cant use their wings to  y. If

the base creature  ew magically, so can the revived fossil.

Armor  Class:  Natural  armor  bonus  changes  to  a  number

based on the revived fossils size:

Attacks:  A  revived

fossil  retains  all  the

natural  weapons,  manu-

factured  weapon  attacks,

and weapon pro ciencies of

the  base  creature,  except

for  attacks  that  cant

work  without   esh  (such

as  a  mind   ayers  tentacle

attacks). A creature with hands

gains  one  claw  attack  per  hand;  a

revived fossil can strike with each of

its claw attacks at its full attack bonus.

A  revived  fossils  base  attack  bonus  is

equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice.

Damage: Natural and manufactured

weapons  deal  damage  normally.  A

claw attack deals damage depend-

ing on the revived fossils size.

(If the base creature already had

claw or talon attacks, use which-

ever damage value is higher.)

its melee or

ranged at-

tacks. A

A knot of  accidly  apping membranes kites through the air, now

drifting with the currents, now stooping swiftly through the air

toward you.

Skin kites are undead creatures made up of the stolen skin of

past victims. They feed on the skin of living beings, replenishing

their own constantly rotting skin, as well as using new skin as

spawning material for new skin kites.

No two skin kites appear the same. They display a range of

different colors, depending on the creatures from which they

were harvested. Many skin kites have rotting clumps of hair or

fur, unintended additional trophies from past victims.

A skin kite has no body, only a wingspan, which is about 5

feet. It weighs about 5 pounds.

COMBAT

A skin kite attacks by landing on a victim and melding a portion

of its undead membrane with its victims skin.

Diet  Dependent:  A  skin  kite  is  diet  dependent  (see  the

Undead Metabolism section in Chapter 1) upon skin, which it

acquires by using its steal skin ability.

Skirr

Launch Kite (Ex): When a skin kite has absorbed 4

points of Charisma (through its steal skin abil-

ity; see below), it attempts to retreat to a safe

place where it can take a full-round action to

spawn a new skin kite with the stolen skin.

A freshly launched skin kite has a number

of hit points equal to the originals current

total (its full normal hit points are equal

to the originals full normal total, even if its

current hit points are lower than that).

Meld (Ex): If a skin kite hits a Small or

larger creature with a melee touch attack,

it  melds  with  the  opponents  body.  An

attached skin kite is effectively grappling

its prey. The skin kite loses its Dexterity

bonus to AC, but while melded, it is hard

to remove. Skin kites have a +12 racial bonus on

grapple checks ( gured into the statistics above).

A melded skin kite can be struck with a weapon

or grappled itself. To remove a melded skin kite by grap-

pling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the skin

kite, which forcefully peels the creature off and also deals

1d6 points of damage.

Steal  Skin  (Ex):  A  skin  kite  steals  portions  of

its foes skin, absorbing them directly into itself,

dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage in each

round when it remains melded. Once it has dealt

4  points  of  Charisma  damage,  it  detaches  and

 ies  off  to  launch  a  kite.  If  its  victim  reaches

Charisma 0 before a skin kite has dealt 4 points

of Charisma damage, the skin kite unmelds and

seeks a new target.

Skirrs  are  predators

that scavenge the bodies

of those killed by sudden stops. Their favored tactic is to swoop

down, grab a victim, ascend to a height of at least 200 feet, and

then drop the victim in a deadly fall.

Diet Dependent: A skirr is diet dependent (see the Undead

Metabolism section in Chapter 1) upon  esh, which it devours

from the dead bodies of its victims.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a skirr must hit a

Large or smaller opponent with a bite attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold

and usually  ies upward as quickly as possible, intent on drop-

ping its victim from a great height.

The horrible creature walking into view is a mass of free-roaming

intestines,  accid organs, and a few odd rib bones. Dragging behind

it like a dead weight is a lolling, maggot-ridden humanoid head.

A  skulking  cyst  is  disgorged  from  the  rotting  corpse

of a living creature, born of a necrotic cyst that

eventually kills its host (see the necrotic cyst spell,

page 68).

A  skulking  cyst  prefers  shadows  and  dark  corners,  only

revealing the horror of its form when it strikes lone victims

from hiding. Though often cloaked in the detritus of a previ-

ous victim, the skulking cysts true heart is a 1-foot-diameter

spherical sac that contains  uid and semisolid necrotic  esh,

which slowly undulates as if in a mockery of breath.

A skulking cyst does not speak, but it understands Common

and the languages its  eshy carapace originally spoke in life.

COMBAT

A creature of shadows, a skulking cyst prefers to

launch attacks on lone victims from dark

ceilings and sewer grates.

Skulking cyst

Attach  (Ex):  If  a  skulking  cyst  hits  with  an

intestine, it latches onto the opponents body. An

attached skulking cyst has an AC of 15.

Blood Drain (Ex): A skulking cyst drains

blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage

in each round it remains attached. Once it has drained

7 points of Constitution, it uses its necrotic cyst

spell-like  ability.  After  that,  it  drops  off

and  attempts  to  skitter  away  into  a

shadowed  corner  or  other  hidden

location.

Inescapable  Craving:

A  skulking  cyst  has  an

inescapable craving (see the

Undead Metabolism section

in Chapter 1) for blood, which

it  satis es  by  using  its  blood

drain ability.

Spell-Like  Abilities:

3/daydarkness;  1/day

A  slender,  wiry  corpse  moves  toward  you,  supernatural  agility

obvious in its motions. Its leathery, desiccated  esh ripples across

its body, tolerant of the creatures quick movements despite being

lifeless parchment.

Inescapable Craving: A slaughter wight has an inescapable

craving (see the Undead Metabolism section in Chapter 1) for

life force, which it satis es by using its energy drain attack.

Slaughter wights are undead that have been specially touched

by dark gods, endowing them with a vicious hatred of life that

goes beyond that of simple walking dead. A slaughter wights

appearance is an exaggerated and horrifying ef gy of the form

it had in life.

Though  sometimes  found  lurking  in  barrows,  more  often

slaughter wights skulk through the nighttime streets of large

cities seeking to ful ll an order or contract on a living human

target. After all, slaughter wights make exceptional assassins.

A slaughter wight is about the height and weight of a human.

Slaughter wights speak Common.

COMBAT

Slaughter wights are deadly combatants, not only because of

their supernaturally strong blows and ability to drain life from

their foes, but also because of their special knowledge that allows

them to deal and master death (see feats).

A slaughter wight normally attacks using its Power Attack

feat, taking a 5 penalty on its attack rolls and gaining a +5

bonus on damage rolls.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A slaughter wight is

so practiced at dealing death that it has learned

the trick of better aiming its blows

to  deal  maximum  damage.

Coupled  with  its  Improved

Critical  feat,  a  slaughter

wights threat range for

its slam attack is 1720.

Create Spawn (Su):

Any humanoid slain by a

slaughter  wight  becomes

a  normal  wight  in  1d4  rounds.  Spawn

created by a slaughter wight are

under  its  command  and

remain  enslaved  until

their  masters  destruction.

They have the statistics of normal

wights (see Monster Manual, page

255 ) and do not retain any of the

abilities they had in life.

Sometimes  a  newly  created

spawn  becomes  a  slaughter  wight  in-

stead of a mere wight, though the wiles of

the dark gods determine such instances (that

is, the DM decides when this occurs).

Energy Drain (Su): A living creature hit by a

slaughter  wights  slam  attack  gains  one  negative

level. Removing the negative level requires a DC 21

Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

When a slaughter wight bestows a negative

level on a victim, it gains 5 temporary hit

points (10 on a critical hit). These tempo-

rary hit points last for up to 1 hour.

This  pale  creature  re-

sembles  a  human  child

with  slug-white  skin.  Its

black  eyes  are  too  knowing

for  their  size,  and  its  too-wide

mouth is home to rot and ruin.

Slaymates  are  undead  creatures  given

a  semblance  of  life  when  a  guardians

betrayal,  either  outright  or  through

negligence, leads to death. A slaymates

appearance is a weird and twisted re ec-

tion of the form it had in life.

Slaymates  are  highly  prized  by  nec-

romancers,  and  thus  are  rarely  encountered

alone, but instead are found in the presence of

evil spellcasters and others who dabble in nec-

romancy. Many a slaymate can be found riding,

papoose style, on the back of a necromancer who

values the slaymates special abilities.

A slaymate is about the height and weight of an

eight-year-old human child.

Slaymates speak Common.

COMBAT

Slaymates, when forced to  ght, have a disease-laden bite.

Pale Aura (Su): A slaymate produces an invisible aura in a

10-foot radius around itself. Any creature within the aura that

uses a metamagic feat on a spell from the school of necromancy

can prepare or use the spell as if it took up a spell slot one level

lower than what the metamagic necromancy spell would

normally require.

For  instance,  if  a  caster  wants  to  produce  an

enlarged fear spell, the enlargement would normally

require the spellcaster to prepare the spell (or cast

it on the  y) as if it were one level higher than it

actually is. But, in the radius of a slaymates pale aura,

the caster prepares an enlarged fear spell

as if the spell were being cast normally.

Pale Wasting (Su): Supernatural dis-

easebite, Fortitude DC 14, incubation

period 1 day; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6

Level Adjustment: 

A smiling, brightly clothed  gure stands before you.

In life, a spectral lyrist used its powers of performance and per-

suasion to further the cause of evil and strife, whether by urging

listeners to commit violence or simply luring the innocent to

their deaths. Cursed to forever walk the earth, it blames those

still alive for its undead state and seeks to commit even greater

evils against them.

A spectral lyrist can appear as any Medium humanoid, and

it  doesnt  share  the  insubstantial  or  diaphanous  appearance

of  other  incorporeal  creatures  when  so  disguised.  A  lyrist  is

weightless, regardless of appearance.

Spectral lyrists speak Common, plus one other language

common  to  humanoids  in  its  environment,  such  as

Dwarven, Elven, Goblin, or Orc.

COMBAT

A spectral lyrist uses its ability to

bluff and change its appearance to

present itself as a friendly creature,

putting  victims  at  ease  until  it

can use its fascinate and suggestion

abilities. Once victims are close

enough, it uses its touch attack

to drain their Charisma.

Alter  Appearance  (Su):  As  a

free  action  once  per  round,  a  spectral

lyrist can alter its appearance. It can appear

as any humanoid creature of Medium size, and

it gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks when

it uses this ability. Unless the disguise

is pierced by a successful Spot check,

onlookers dont even notice the lyrists

incorporeal nature until an attack passes harm-

lessly through the creature.

Bardic Music (Su): A spectral lyrist has

the  bardic  music  abilities  of  fascinate  and

suggestion. These function identically to the bard class

features of the same name. A spectral lyrist can use

these abilities a total of six times per day.

Charisma  Drain  (Su):  Living  creatures  hit  by  a

spectral lyrists touch attack must make a DC 18 Forti-

tude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma drain. The save

DC  is  Charisma-based.  When  a  spectral  lyrist  drains  a

victims Charisma, it gains 5 temporary hit points and 1

temporary Charisma point, no matter how many points

it drains. Temporary hit points and ability points gained

in this way last for 1 up to hour.

Inescapable Craving: A spectral lyrist has an ines-

capable craving (see the Undead Metabolism

section in Chapter 1) for Charisma, which it

satis es by using its Charisma drain attack.

SWARM-SHIFTER

The  vampire  that  explodes  into  a   ock  of  bats,  the  mummy

that crumbles into a pile of scorpionsthese are swarm-shift-

ers, undead that have been granted the dark power to become

swarms.

A  swarm-shifter  appears  like  a  normal  undead  creature

until its body explodes into a swarm. There are many varieties

of swarm-shifters, and although some are more common than

others, swarm-shifters do not seem limited to certain kinds of

swarms by their form of undeath.

wrappings.

Combat

A Thousand Faces (Su): This mummy king can change its

appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while

in its normal form.

Animal Companion (Ex): As a 13th-level druid, this mummy

king has an animal companion. The mummy king typically sets

this animal to guard a location or object.

Despair (Su): At the mere sight of this mummy king, the

viewer must make a DC 18 Will save or be paralyzed with fear

for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that viewer

cannot be affected again by this mummys despair ability for 24

hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Mummy Rot (Su): Supernatural diseaseslam, Fortitude

DC 18, incubation period 1 minute, damage 1d6 Con and 1d6

Cha. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot persists until the victim

reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below.

Mummy  rot  is  a  powerful  curse,  not  a  natural  disease.  A

character attempting to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on

a creature af icted with mummy rot must make a successful DC

20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the af icted

character.

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must  rst be broken with

break enchantment or remove curse (requiring a DC 20 caster level

check for either spell), after which a caster level check is no

longer necessary to cast healing spells on the victim, and the

mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease.

An af icted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into

sand and dust that blows away into nothing at the  rst wind.

Nature Sense (Ex): +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and

Survival checks.

Resist Natures Lure (Ex): This mummy king gains a +4

bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Swarm Form (Su): This mummy king is able to turn into

a swarm of beetles, sand, or scorpions. See the swarm-shifter

template for more details.

CREATING A

SWARM-SHIFTER

Swarm-shifter is an acquired

template that can be added

to any corporeal undead

with  an  Intelligence

score  (referred  to  here-

after as the base creature).

A swarm-shifter uses all the base creatures

statistics  and  special  abilities  except  as

noted here.

Note: Unlike most tem-

plates, an undead can

potentially  acquire

this  template  more

than once, gaining

a new swarm form

with each applica-

tion.

Size and Type:

The base creatures

type  and  size  do  not

change,  but  it  gains  the

shapechanger  subtype.  When

in swarm form, it also has the swarm subtype and a new size

(as determined by the particular swarm form, each described

below). The swarms size in uences how wind affects it and how

weapons damage it.

Hit Dice: The base creature retains its Hit Dice and hit points

when it takes swarm form, but changing forms heals damage

(as described in the swarm form ability description, below).

Speed: When in swarm form, the base creature has the move-

ment modes and speeds listed for the particular kind of swarm

(each described below).

Armor  Class:  When  in  swarm  form,  change  the  base

creatures  natural  armor  according  to  its  size  change  using

Table 42, page 291 of the Monster Manual. In swarm form, the

base  creature  also  gains  a  new  size  modi er  to  Armor  Class

depending on the swarms size, as shown in Table 71, page 314

of the Monster Manual.

Base Attack/Grapple: When in swarm form, the base crea-

ture cannot grapple or be grappled. See the swarm subtype for

details.

Attack  and  Full  Attack:  When  in  swarm  form,  the  base

creature lacks its normal attacks. Instead, a swarm-shifter has

a swarm attack. This attack automatically damages any creature

in the swarm-shifters space when it ends its move.

If the base creatures natural attacks are treated in a manner

that allowed it to overcome damage reduction, it retains that

ability with its swarm attack in swarm form. For example, if

the base creatures natural attacks are treated as chaotic-aligned

for  the  purposes  of  overcoming  damage  reduction,  its

swarm  attack  is  also  treated  as  chaotic-aligned  for

this purpose.

See the swarm subtype description at

the beginning of this chapter for more

details about the swarm attack.

Damage: The amount of damage a

swarm-shifter deals with its swarm

attack is based on its Hit Dice, as

shown in the table below.

Space/Reach:  When  the  base

creature  is  in  swarm  form,  it  has  a

space of 10 feet. In swarm form, it has a

reach of 0 feet, it cannot make attacks of

opportunity,  and  it  provokes  attacks  of

opportunity when it enters a crea-

tures space. The swarm can

occupy  another  creatures

space  and  moves  through

other  creatures  squares

without  impediment  and

vice versa. The swarm can

move  through  holes  and

cracks  large  enough  for  its

component creatures.

Special  Attacks:  When  in  swarm  form,  a  swarm-shifter

loses  all  the  special  attacks  of  the  base  creature.  It  gains  the

distraction and swarm special attacks, and gains new special

attacks dependent on the swarm form it takes (as described in

the individual swarm form entries below).

Distraction (Ex): As described in the Swarm Traits section at

the beginning of this chapter.

Swarm (Ex): As described under the Attack and Damage entries

above, the base creature in swarm form has a swarm attack.

Special Qualities: The base creature retains all special quali-

ties and gains the swarm form special quality. When the base

creature is in swarm form, it also gains the hive mind special

quality. It loses special qualities of the base creature that rely on

the base creatures shape or abilities it lacks in swarm form. In

addition, it gains other special qualities dependent on the swarm

form it takes (as described in the individual entries below).

Hive Mind (Ex): A swarm-shifter with this ability is immune

to any spell or effect that targets a speci c number of creatures

(including single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the excep-

tion of effects that command, control, turn, rebuke, bolster, or

destroy undead speci cally. A swarm-shifter in swarm form is

affected by turn and rebuke attempts just like the base creature.

Swarm Form (Su): The base creature can take the form of an

undead swarm at will. The swarm (or swarms, if this template is

applied multiple times) the base creature can turn into is chosen

when this template is  rst applied. Each form alters the base

creature in swarm form in different ways (as described in the

individual entries below).

Changing shape to or from swarm form is a standard action

that infuses the undead with negative energy and heals 1 hit

point of damage per HD of the base creature. The undead cannot

change from swarm form to its normal form in an area where

its body could not normally  t. As with the alter self spell, the

base  creatures  items  are  absorbed  into  the  swarm  form  and

provide no bene t. When it would normally be dispersed due

to damage taken, the swarm reverts to the base creatures form

and  is  destroyed  (except  in  the  case  of  vampires,  liches,  and

other undead with special destruction rules).

If the swarm-shifter has multiple swarm forms, it can change

from one swarm form directly into another, losing the  rst swarms

traits and gaining those of the other. When switching from one

swarm form to another, the undead does not heal damage.

Although  the  use  of  this  ability  is  a  supernatural  effect,

remaining in one form or another is not supernatural, and the

base creature in swarm form does not change into its normal

shape in an antimagic  eld. True seeing and similar magic reveals

both forms.

Abilities: The base creatures Strength and Dexterity scores

are different in swarm form due to the swarm creatures size.

When  the  base  creature  takes  swarm  form,  change  the  base

creatures Strength and Dexterity scores according to Table 42,

page 291 of the Monster Manual. This template cannot reduce

the base creatures Strength in swarm form to less than 1.

Skills:  An  undead  in  swarm  form  gains  a  +10  bonus  on

Disguise checks to act like a normal grouping of its constitu-

ent creatures. An undead in sand swarm form gains this bonus

when acting like inanimate sand. An undead in parts swarm

form gains this bonus when acting like inanimate body parts.

In swarm form, the swarm creatures new size, speed, and ability

scores can affect skill bonuses. An undead in swarm form loses

the ability to speak.

Feats: Same as the base creature, but when the base creature

is in swarm form it cannot bene t from feats that rely on attacks

(such as Power Attack and Combat Expertise), special attacks

of the base creature, or other abilities the base creature cannot

use in swarm form.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1. If this tem-

plate is applied multiple times, the base creatures Challenge

Rating increases by 2, regardless of how many swarm forms the

creature can take in excess of one.

Level Adjustment: .

Tomb mote

An  umbral  crea-

ture looks like a shadowy

version  of  a  material

creature, and it may eas-

ily be mistaken for a living

creature  from  the  Plane  of

Shadow. Umbral creatures are dif-

 cult to see in dark or gloomy areas, but they stand out starkly

in brightly illuminated places.

Natural enemies of all that live, umbral creatures are aggres-

sive and predatory. They are quick to strike and make short work

of those unprepared to deal with them.

These tiny, vaguely humanoid creatures are animated accumula-

tions of tomb littershards of bone, lone teeth, matted hair, bits

of shattered tombstone, and grave dirt.

SAMPLE UMBRAL CREATURE

This example uses a displacer beast as the base creature.

Tomb motes sometimes spontaneously arise in graveyards with

a high concentration of buried magic, undead activity, and/or

mass burials. As accumulations of grave detritus, tomb motes

are surprisingly smart and  vicious.

Tomb motes weigh 5 to 8 pounds and measure no more than

1 foot in height.

Tomb motes understand Common and Abyssal but do not

speak.

COMBAT

Tomb motes typically attack from ambush due to their size. If

possible, they attempt to attack a foe en masse.

Disease (Ex): A creature struck by a tomb motes bite attack

must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be infected with a disease

known as corpse bloat (incubation period 1d3 days, damage 1d6

Str). The skin of a diseased victim turns a hue of green, bloats,

and is warm to the touch. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Combat

Umbral displacer beasts rely on their incorporeal nature and

their natural displacement to avoid most attacks. Due to their

limited Intelligence, they dont typically take full advantage of

their incorporeal nature (such as attacking from above).

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid reduced to Strength 0 by

an umbral displacer beast rises as a shadow under the control

of its killer in 1d4 rounds.

Displacement (Su): A light-bending glamer continually sur-

rounds an umbral displacer beast, making it dif cult to surmise

the creatures true location. Any melee or ranged attack directed

at it has a 50% miss chance unless the attacker can locate the beast

by some means other than sight. A true seeing effect allows the

user to see the beasts position, but see invisibility has no effect.

Inescapable  Craving:  An  umbral  displacer  beast  has  an

inescapable  craving  (see  the  Undead  Metabolism  section  in

Chapter 1) for Strength, which it satis es by using its Strength

damage ability.

Resistance to Ranged Attacks (Su): An umbral displacer beast

has a +2 resistance bonus on saves against any ranged magical attack

that speci cally targets it (except for ranged touch attacks).

Strength Damage (Su): The touch of an umbral displacer

beast  deals  1d8  points  of  Strength  damage  to  a  living  foe.  A

creature reduced to Strength 0 by an umbral displacer

beast dies.

Skills: An umbral displacer beast has a +8 racial

bonus on Hide checks, thanks to its displacement

ability.

CREATING AN

UMBRAL CREATURE

Umbral creature is an acquired template that can be added to

any aberration, dragon, giant, magical beast, or monstrous hu-

manoid with a Charisma score of at least 8 (hereafter referred to

as the base creature). Humanoids instead become shad-

ows, as described on page 221

of the the Monster Manual.

Umbral creatures speak whatever languages they spoke

in life. An umbral creature has all the base creatures char-

acteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead,

and  it  gains  the  incorporeal  and  augmented  subtypes.  It

retains any subtypes except alignment subtypes (such as

good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as goblinoid).

Size is unchanged.

Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice from class levels (to a minimum

of 1), and raise the remaining Hit Dice to d12s.

Speed: The creatures speed becomes  y 40 feet (perfect).

AC: The creature loses its natural armor bonus but gains a

de ection bonus equal to its Charisma modi er or +1, whichever

is greater.

New feat described on page 27.

This creature appears only somewhat solid, with a mostly shape-

less body. Its only de nite features include a pale, white, masklike

face bearing a perpetual grin and a pair of particularly long and

nasty claws.

The  visage  is  a  devious  undead  creature  that  steals  the  iden-

tity of its victims to further its chaotic and evil aims. The  rst

visages were formed from the spirits of demons by Orcus, De-

mon Prince of Undead, while he had assumed the identity of

Tenebrous. When he reassumed his true identity and mantle,

Visage

however, Orcus discarded the visages from his service, and since

that time, they have reproduced by spawning new visages from

any evil outsiders.

Though a visage appears incorporeal, it does not actually pos-

sess  that  quality.  A  visage  isnt  very  dense,  though,  and  only

weighs about 75 pounds despite its size. In its normal form, it

is sometimes mistaken for a wraith.

Visages speak Common and Abyssal.

COMBAT

Visages prefer subterfuge to overt combat, since their physical

attacks arent very threatening. They use their dominate person

and lucidity control abilities to in uence weak-willed individu-

als, hoping to draw them to places where they can  nish them off

secretly and assume their identities. Then, the visage uses this

new identity to sow chaos and discord as long as possible.

A visages natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,

are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose

of overcoming damage reduction.

Assume Identity (Su): A visage can, as a free action, take on

the form of someone it has killed within the last round. A visage

in an assumed identity gains a +20 bonus on Bluff and Disguise

checks made to pass as the victim. It also gains pro ciency in

the skills of the victim; treat this as an enhancement bonus to

the skill check equal to the number of ranks the victim had in

life. The visage does not gain the victims extraordinary, super-

natural, or spell-like abilities, nor does it gain any spellcasting

powers of the victim. The visage retains its own ability scores,

special attacks, and special qualities.

This effect lasts for 24 hours, though the visage can dismiss

it at will. While a visage is in the form of its victim, that victim

cant be returned to life except by a true resurrection spell (which

also immediately ends the effect on the visage). After 24 hours, or

if the identity is dismissed, the soul is damaged, and the victim

can be returned to life only by a miracle or wish spell followed

by a true resurrection.

Create  Spawn  (Su):  Any  evil  outsider  slain  by  a  visage

becomes  a  visage  24  hours  after  death.  Spawn  are  under  the

command of the visage that created them and remain enslaved

until death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had

in life.

Dominate Person (Sp): Once per day, a visage can use domi-

nate person, as the spell cast at 12th level (Will DC 19 negates).

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Lucidity Control (Su): A visage can create a major image,

similar  to  the  major  image  spell  except  that  only  one  target,

selected by the visage, can perceive the illusion (Will DC 21

disbelief). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Positive  Immunity  (Ex):  A  visage  is  immune  to  damage

from positive energy effects, including holy water, cure wounds

spells, and the like. It gains no immunity to turning.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  A  visage  deals  an  extra  4d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage applies to point-blank ranged

attacks as well. Creatures with concealment, creatures without

discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are also immune to the visages sneak attack.

Skills:  A  visage  gets  a  +10  racial  bonus  on  Escape  Artist

and  Move  Silently  checks  (already   gured  into  the  statistics

above).

This creature appears to be a formless cloud of darkness, broken

only by two pinpoints of glowing red. A breeze blows toward it,

as if it were drawing air into its body.

A  voidwraith  is  an  undead  manifestation  of  elemental  air.  It

hungers for the breath of the living.

Voidwraiths vaguely resemble wraiths in their appearance,

but  are  more  amorphous  and  cloudlike.  Still,  they  share  the

wraiths hatred for all living things.

A voidwraith  lls an area roughly 5 feet on a side, with cloud-

like tendrils reaching beyond that. As an incorporeal creature,

a voidwraith has no weight.

Voidwraiths speak Auran.

COMBAT

A voidwraith lurks in dark places until it can sweep

out and attack a living victim. Thanks to its

stealth and speed, it often surprises

targets.

Airless Aura (Su): A voidwraiths body is surrounded by an

aura of near vacuum at all times. This means that any creatures

adjacent to the voidwraith have no air to breathe and must hold

their breath (see Suffocation, page 304 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide).

Elemental Turning Vulnerability (Ex): A character who

can turn undead and also turn air creatures gains a +2 bonus

on turning checks to turn a voidwraith. A character who can

rebuke undead and also rebuke air creatures gains a +2 bonus

on turning checks to rebuke a voidwraith.

Inescapable  Craving:  A  voidwraith  has  an  inescapable

craving  (see  the  Undead  Metabolism  section  in  Chapter  1)

for  Constitution,  which  it  satis es  by  using  its    steal  breath

ability,.

Steal Breath (Su): Living creatures hit by a voidwraiths touch

attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points

of Constitution drain. (Creatures with the air subtype take

a 4 penalty on this save.) When a voidwraith drains a

victims Constitution, it gains 5 temporary hit points,

no matter how many points it drains. Temporary hit

points gained in this way last for 1 up to hour. The save

DC is Charisma-based.

If  the  target  creature  is  holding  its  breath

and  fails  the  save,  the  number  of  rounds  of

remaining breath is reduced by 2 per point

of  Constitution  drained.  If  this  reduction

exhausts all of the targets remaining breath,

it creature must begin making

Constitution checks or start to

suffocate (see Suffocation, page

304  of  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide).

Skills: A voidwraith has a +4

racial bonus on Hide checks.

Special Attacks: Weeping dirge,

poison tears

Environment: Cold mountains

Organization: Solitary, pair, group (34), or weep (610)

Level Adjustment: 

The empty orbs of this wizened corpse leak a vile, black ichor that

streaks the creatures face and body, coating its clawed limbs. As

the ichor runs into the creatures mouth, it bubbles and pops, so

that its constant wailing emerges as a gurgling keen.

Wheeps are undead servants of more powerful unliving lords,

usually serving as bodyguards but sometimes sent on missions

to procure from guarded cemeteries the remains of particularly

powerful  and  trusted   gures.  Their  average  size  belies  a

powerful  undead  strength,  fueled  by  their  undying

sorrow.

Eyeless, a wheep is in constant pain, snif ing

and  crying  aloud  unless  it  is  trying  to  hide  or

move  silently.  From  its  hollow  eye  sockets,  a

wheep continuously produces a poison with

the appearance of black bile. It is easy to track

wheeps that have passed through an area in the

last hour, because they leave behind a trail of their

poisonous tears. After an hour, the bile decomposes

and evaporates.

A wheep stands nearly 6 feet tall and weighs about

200 pounds.

Wheeps speak Common.

COMBAT

Those close enough to hear a wheeps cries

may be taken aback, but they are likely to

be far more threatened by the creatures poi-

son-coated claws and maw.

Poison Tears (Ex): The poison tears that continually pour

from a wheeps empty eyes are actually an injury poison that

coats the creatures claws and  lls its mouth. Whenever a

wheep succeeds on a claw or bite attack, its foe is subject to

the poisoninjury, Fortitude DC 19, initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Con. The save DC is Charisma-based. After

an hour, the poisonous bile decomposes and evaporates,

losing all ef cacy.

Unholy Grace (Su): A wheep adds its Charisma

modi er as a bonus on all its saving throws and

as a de ection bonus to its Armor Class

(already  gured into the statis-

Wheep

tics above).

Weeping Dirge (Su): When

it chooses (which is almost always, un-

less moving silently), a wheep can spend a free action each

round crying and blubbering. All who hear the wheeps

awful, grave-born sorrow must make DC 19 Will saves or be

shaken  for  the  duration  of  the  encounter.  Once  a  particular

creature saves against a wheeps dirge, that creature cannot be

affected again by the same wheep for 24 hours. This is a sonic

effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Special Qualities: Blindsight 60 ft., damage

reduction 5/magic and piercing, darkvision 60 ft., fast

healing 10, undead traits, unholy grace, +4 turn resistance

Saves: Fort +8, Ref +10, Will +13

Abilities: Str 33, Dex 15, Con , Int 6, Wis 14, Cha 20

reatures of unlife are among the most evocative and

exciting  monsters  in  the  D&D  game.  Undead  are

simultaneously the ultimate in inhumanity and all too

recognizable as what they once were. They can also be

extremely challenging for a DM to run properly.

Undead creatures possess a wide range of special powers,

and can  ll almost any role in your campaign, from dumb

brute to conniving archenemy. This chapter provides you (the

DM) with guidance on how to use undead in your game, both

at the macro level (incorporating them into your campaign)

and at the micro level (by examining their tactics, powers,

and weaknesses).

Undead make great antagonists for characters of every level.

Their very existence is anathema to many characters, and they

give any encounter a distinct feel because of their unique and

powerful abilities. This chapter also provides sample undead

for many of the templates in the Monster Manual, a selection

of cults dedicated to the undead, and a variety of interesting

adventure  locations  that  feature  undead  guardians.  Each  of

these elements should help you add undead to your campaign

quickly and easily.

The six full-page maps placed throughout the chapter do

not refer speci cally to any creature or scenario, but rather

are meant to provide interesting locations for unique undead

encounters of your own design.

INCORPORATING

UNDEAD INTO YOUR

CAMPAIGN

Because of the wide range of Challenge Ratings for undead

creatures (especially paired with the  exibility of undead

templates), encounters with such creatures are common

at  all  levels  of  play.  Depending  on  how  you  use  such

encounters,  the  role  of  undead  in  the  campaign  can

vary dramatically. This section explores some options

on how to utilize undead in your campaign, whether as

foes for your player characters or even as the focus for

your entire world.

UNDEAD AS MONSTERS

In  most  cases,  undead  function  best  merely  as

challenges  to  overcome,  particularly  in  the  case  of

nonintelligent undead (skeletons and zombies). But

regardless  of  whether  they  face  skeletons,  ghouls,

wraiths, or even nightshades, the characters in your

game might treat undead no differently from any

other monsters, which is perfectly  ne. The many

options available in this book can still help such

encounters be memorable and exciting, even if they

arent the centerpieces of your campaign.

If  this  is  your  preferred  role  for  undead,  then  you

should avoid overuse of undead that traditionally serve

as major motivating forces behind evil plots (such as

133

vampires and liches). Instead, rely on straightforward undead

creatures such as ghouls, wights, wraiths, spectres, and mohrgs.

Use any of them as nasty minions, as horrifying inhabitants of

foul locales, or even as wandering monsters.

Undead Monster Adventure Hooks

Several zombies left over from an evil clerics army

of undead have wandered too close to a village of

innocents.

The city guard has been finding catatonic dock workers

lying in alleyways for several days, the victims of an allip

who committed suicide by drowning itself in the river.

A pack of ghouls has moved into a local graveyard and

is feasting on the recently deceased.

City engineers excavating the foundation for a new

temple of Pelor accidentally uncover a barrow-mound

occupied by a gang of wights.

Three days after an infamous mass murderer was

hanged, the body disappeared and the murders started

up again. The murderer, now a mohrg, seeks to recreate

its reign of terror.

UNDEAD AS MASTERMINDS

Some undead, particularly ghosts, vampires, and liches, func-

tion best when they arent used simply as speed bumps between

characters and their next level. Such creatures have a deadly

combination  of  high  intelligence  and  longevity,  so  they  are

willing to wait a long time for a plan to come to fruition. A lich

might be comfortable working behind the scenes for months

or even years, slowly moving all the pieces into place before

making  a  decisive  strike.  These  undead  schemers  typically

work through their living agents or minions, remaining in the

shadows as long as possible.

Undead Mastermind Adventure Hooks

The ghost of the former guildmaster of assassins has

returned to reclaim its mantle. Now the ghost rules a

fearless band of killers who believe that if they die in

service, they will be rewarded with eternal unlife. They

might even be right!

A formerly respected cleric of St. Cuthbert is now

a vampire. This foul creature has transformed the

acolytes of the temple into vampire spawn, which it

sends out each night to slaughter as many innocents as

possible.

A powerful lich sorcerer engineers the kidnapping of

a royal heir, then plants clues to the heirs location.

Before the rescue, the lich possesses the heirs body

with magic jar. Once safely ensconced in the heirs royal

quarters, it sends minions to retrieve its body, hiding it

within range of the spell. Each day the lich repeats the

spell, maintaining possession of the heirs body until

it manages to arrange the death of the king, at which

point the lich takes over the kingdom.

UNDEAD-THEMED CAMPAIGNS

For a twist on the traditional D&D experience, you can run a

campaign centered on one or more aspects of the undead. A

world where undead are far more common, for instance, breeds

a very different kind of hero from what the traditional D&D

setting offers.

The Risen Dead

In a world of this type, corpses rise as undead creatures after

death, even without the application of animate dead or similar

magic. The simplest version of this setup brings such creatures

back as zombies, though at your option particularly vile individu-

als might return as ghouls, wights, or worse.

To run such a campaign, here are some questions about the

world that youll need to answer:

How long has the animating effect been active? Is it a new

addition  to  the  world  (possibly  the  result  of  some  horrible

cataclysm of necromancy) or has it always been that way? The

answer to this question can help set the tone for the world.

How long after death does the body riserounds, minutes,

hours, or days? The shorter the time lag, the scarier the effect.

If a character who falls in battle rises as a zombie mere rounds

later, death becomes a truly terrifying prospect for characters.

Do only humanoids rise as undead, or does it affect a wider

range of creatures? A world where every dead creature walks

the earth until destroyed might  ll up pretty fast!

Can the effect be suppressed, or even ended? This might make

a great campaign goal for your heroes.

World of Shadows

In a world of this type, undead creatures exist alongside other

races  (sometimes  secretly,  sometimes  not  so  secretly)  within

normal society. Vampires attend gala events (always after dark, of

course), mummies work as night watchmen, and zombie platoons

go into combats too brutal for living soldiers. Depending on the

tone of the campaign, society might treat undead as oddities,

celebrities, or even just like normal people.

For this campaign formula, youd need to answer the following

sorts of questions.

Are all undead inherently evil, or are the normal alignment

restrictions relaxed or even absent? If the characters know that

the lich attending tonights opera is automatically evil, that can

eliminate many interesting roleplaying opportunities. If undead

arent necessarily evil, what about spells that create undead?

Is there any stigma to returning from the dead as an undead

creature? Is a newly risen wight shunned by its old friends?

What about legal standing? Are vampires considered the same

people in undeath as they were in lifeespecially in regard to

ownership of property and the like? Are they even considered

citizens at all (particularly important for lawful societies)? Are

the  answers  to  these  questions  different  for  nonintelligent

undead?

Undying Rulers

The ultimate challenge for a band of heroes is to triumph when

the  entire  world  is  set  against  them.  In  a  land  ruled  by  the

undead, you can guarantee that the characters have few allies

to assist them in their adventures. Liches and vampires make

the best undead rulers, while other undead work best in roles

as soldiers, lieutenants, spies, and scouts.

This  setting  faces  many  of  the  same  issues  as  the  world

of  shadows  campaign  detailed  above,  though  youll  need  to

consider a few additional questions:

How did the undead take over? Did they transform the worlds

existing rulers into undead beings, or did they merely conquer

through  more  conventional  means,  such  as  with  armies  of

zombies and skeletons or a clever palace coup?

How widespread is the rule of the undead? Do they rule a

single city, a kingdom, an entire continent, or the whole world?

If the undead only rule a limited swath of territory, the rest of

the world might either be fearful of the control spreading or

hopeful of containing or even destroying it.

How complete is the undeads control over their territory? Do

townsfolk live in fear of nightly ghoul attacks on those out after

sunset, or can they go about their business in relative normalcy?

Do packs of wights drag people from their homes to join the

ranks of the undying armies of the land? Are promising villagers

plucked from their families to become vampiric princes of the

realm? And perhaps most important, can the heroes count on

any help from the locals, or is everyone too afraid (or too well

trained by their masters) to even consider aiding and abetting

those who would resist undying rule?

RUNNING

UNDEAD ENCOUNTERS

When the thirst comes upon me so  ercely I cant recall my own name,

when the searing Eye of the Day scalds my  esh, or as loneliness shrouds

the vacuum where my soul used to reside, I wonder if I am as invincible

as I pretend.

Blaesing, Dim Triad member

skeletons tactics arent likely to vary, since it doesnt have the

intelligence to adapt to the situation).

General

From the lowly ghoul to the mighty nightshade, most intelligent

undead favor ambushes. They rely on their ability to hide and

move quietly to take adventurers by surprise. Since most undead

also have the ability to weaken or neutralize foes with even a

single hit, the advantage of a  rst strike can prove substantial.

Some  undead  creatures  bene t  from  preparation  before

a  ght. The lich is the most obvious example of this tactic,

since it typically has many spells it can use in combat. Other

undead that pro t from a few rounds of prep time include the

devourer (with spell-like abilities such as ghoul touch, spectral

hand, true seeing, and even lesser planar ally), nightshades (deeper

darkness, haste, see invisibility), and of course, spellcasting ghosts

and vampires.

Allip

An allip opens encounters with its hypnotizing babble, which

is likely to neutralize at least one member of a typical low-level

adventuring  party.  Though  an  allip  doesnt  use  the  victims

improved  attitude  to  make  requests,  it  takes  advantage  of

any  characters  fascination  to  go  after  unaffected  targets.  Its

unrelenting nature means it rarely retreats

Undead run the gamut from simple to complex,

but each one has its own tricks in combat.

As  with  any  encounter,  read  the  undead

creatures  description  carefully  before

running  it  in  combat.  Think  not  only

about  what  tactics  it  is  likely  to  use,  but

also what tactics the players are likely to

use against it, reading up on any rules that

you might need. Consult the special attack

and special quality discussions later in this

chapter for pointers.

For instance, if you use an undead crea-

ture with damage reduction, familiarize

yourself  with  the  rules  for  damage

reduction,  as  well  as  the  rules  for

switching  weapons  in  a   ght.  If  a

 ghter has to switch from sword to

warhammer to battle skeletons, make

sure that the character faces the tough

choice of dropping the sword to attack

with the hammer in the same round (and

possibly losing the sword if forced into

a  hasty  retreat)  or  carefully  sheathing

it before drawing the hammer, thereby

giving up a round of attacks.

TACTICS

This  section  details  some  typical

tactics used by the undead fea-

tured in the Monster Manual.

gestions only; feel free to

Rounds 3 and Later:

Bodak

Other  than  its  death

gaze,  a  bodak  doesnt

pose much threat to the

average party. Its melee

attacks deal relatively lit-

tle  damage,  so  a  bodak

often   ghts  defensively

(or  even  uses  total  de-

fense) to give its death

gaze  more  time  to

work.  A  bodak  isnt

Round 1: Target a character with death gaze.

Rounds 2 and Later: Alternate between targeting foes with

death gaze and withdrawing from combat. If a bodak withdraws

from combat, it cant target a foe with its death gaze, but foes

who dont block their vision must still make a save each round

on their turns.

Devourer

The sadistic devourer prefers unfair  ghts, often preying on lone

visitors to the Ethereal Plane or Astral Plane. However, its just as

capable of holding its own against a group. The tactics given here

assume the devourer has a trapped essence; if not, it attempts to

trap one of its enemies at the earliest opportunity. A devourer

is smart enough to target its attacks on foes most likely to be

adversely affected (confusion or suggestion against melee  ghters,

energy drain attacks on spellcasters, and so forth).

Prior to Combat: Spectral hand, true seeing.

Round 1: Use confusion to scatter a group of foes, or target

a single foe with energy drain attack (preferably via its spectral

hand).

Rounds 2 and Later: Focus efforts on single enemy, either

with ray of enfeeblement, ghoul touch, or additional energy drain

attacks.

Ghost

The ghosts tactics vary dramatically based on its special attacks.

Ghosts with frightful moan, corrupting gaze, or horri c appear-

ance often manifest in the middle of their enemies, subjecting

several creatures to the effects of these powers. Ghosts relying

on touch attacks prefer to take on individual foes. A ghost with

telekinesis may haunt its opponents from a distance, remain-

ing out of sight, while one with malevolence seeks to possess

a living body as soon as possible. Regardless of their powers,

ghosts typically dont remain in one place very long, instead

using incorporealness and their ability to turn ethereal to come

and go from combat, picking opportunities with as much care

as their intelligence allows.

Round 1: Manifest, either near opponents or in hiding, as

Lich

As with other templated undead, the lichs tactics depend largely

on its abilities. Most liches prefer to face opponents only after

their  foes  have  gotten  through  the  various  guardians,  traps,

and  other  barriers  that  protect  it  from  intruders.  As  power-

ful spellcasters, liches rely on their magical prowess for both

offense and defense, and characters should rarely encounter a

lich unprepared for them. Once combat begins, a lich quickly

unleashes  its  most  powerful  spells,  hoping  to  catch  as  many

enemies as possible in their effects. As a highly intelligent foe,

a lich can (and should) quickly adjust its tactics to the situation.

See Spellcasting (under Special Qualities, later in this section)

for more information on running a lich in combat.

Prior to Combat: Cast defensive spells as appropriate, includ-

ing calling or summoning allies.

Round 1: Cast area spell (such as  ame strike, chain lightning,

mass hold person, or wave of exhaustion) against group of foes. Cast

quickened spell if possible.

Round  2:  Target  most  dangerous  opponents  with  spells

designed to neutralize them or their abilities (such as greater

dispel magic, slay living, harm, disintegrate, or power word blind).

Rounds 3 and Later: Stay out of melee as long as possible,

relying on spells to hamper, injure, or neutralize opponents. Flee

with teleport, word of recall, or similar magic if facing overwhelm-

ing odds.

Mohrg

Mohrgs rely on stealth and a high initiative modi er to surprise

their opponents. If outnumbered, they attempt to paralyze as

many  foes  as  possible  before  grappling.  Otherwise,  a  mohrg

grapples  a  paralyzed  opponent,  dealing  its  unarmed  damage

with  each  successful  grapple  check  after  the   rst.  It  uses  its

mobility to dart past armored opponents and reach less pro-

tected targets.

Round 1: Attack potentially  at-footed enemy with paralyz-

ing tongue.

Rounds 2 and Later: Full attack, grappling if possible.

appropriate (see above).

Mummy

Rounds 2 and Later: Use special attacks to injure or neutral-

ize foes. Take cover within objects or by returning to the Ethereal

Plane as appropriate.

Ghoul or Ghast

The ghoul (and its deadlier cousin, the ghast) is likely to be the

 rst intelligent undead creature that low-level PCs encounter.

For  those  used  to   ghting  mindless  skeletons  and  zombies,

ghouls  cunning  may  come  as  a  surprise,  which  makes  the

encounter all the more dangerous. Ghouls attempt to paralyze

as  many  targets  as  they  can,  reducing  the  number  of  mobile

foes they face. A ghoul typically ignores a foe once paralyzed,

though if it cant get to another enemy, it may deliver a coup de

grace instead. Ghasts (and ghouls accompanying ghasts) prefer to

 ght sickened opponents. Ghouls and ghasts are smart enough

to  ee a losing  ght, knowing that foes injured by their bites

may join them soon enough anyway.

Round 1: Spring from hiding to deliver paralyzing bite.

Round 2: Full attack if possible. Flank if the opportunity

presents itself.

Rounds 3 and Later: Focus on sickened or otherwise weak-

ened targets. Flee if outmatched.

What a mummy lacks in intelligence and foresight it makes up

for with tenacity and physical strength. While it may succeed in

ambushing enemies, its slow speed and poor initiative allow it

limited opportunity to take advantage of the element of surprise.

Still, a group of adventurers subjected to its paralyzing despair

ability could easily  nd themselves trapped merely watching

the mummy as it delivers slam after brutal slam. The mummys

damage reduction often makes for long combats (particularly

if its foes dont have  re available), possibly even long enough

for mummy rot to kick in. A mummy never retreats from a  ght

unless turned or similarly commanded.

Round  1:  Subject  foes  to  potential  paralysis  with  despair.

Move into melee with paralyzed foe if possible.

Rounds  2  and  Later:  Pummel  targets  into  unconscious-

ness.

Nightshades

Nightshadesa category of undead that includes nightcrawlers,

nightwalkers, and nightwingsshare certain characteristics,

including the ability to summon other undead, a desecrating

aura that gives them and other nearby undead increased power,

spell-like abilities, and substantial capabilities of stealth. Each

one also has an array of other special abilities, ranging from

improved  grab,  swallow  whole,  and  energy  drain  (the  night-

crawler),  evil  gaze  (the  nightwalker),  and  magic  drain  (the

nightwing). Nightshades dont hesitate to use powerful spell-like

abilities against their foes, including greater dispel magic, mass hold

monster,  nger of death, unholy blight, and cone of cold.

Also see the more detailed tactics given for the nightwalker

in the Monster Manual.

Prior to Combat: Summon undead, cast invisibility, see invis-

ibility, and haste.

Round 1: Unleash summoned undead to hamper opponents,

while using more powerful special attacks and spell-like abilities

against foes.

Rounds 2 and Later: Pick off lone enemies while remaining

out of reach of melee  ghters.

Shadow

Shadows lurk in dark places, aiming to surprise their victims.

They typically gang up on a single foe, subjecting the target to

multiple Strength-draining incorporeal touch attacks. A group

of shadows can easily reduce a victim to helplessness or death in

a short time. Because of their limited intelligence, shadows are

as likely to pick a strong target as a weak one for these attacks,

though they are smart enough to focus on foes who prove capable

of harming them (such as with a ghost touch weapon or magic

missiles). They arent as single-minded as many other undead,

and often  ee from bright light or tough opponents. Greater

shadows  use  similar  tactics,  though  their  Spring  Attack  feat

allows them to move from within a wall or  oor, attack a foe,

and move back to cover in a single round.

Round 1: Attack enemy with Strength-draining incorporeal

touch attack, ganging up if possible.

Rounds 2 and Later: Continue attacks, falling back to safety

within solid objects if necessary.

Skeleton

As an unintelligent creature, a skeleton doesnt have any faculty

to plan or use strategy. It doesnt try to  ank opponents, or move

past armored  ghters to attack unarmored wizards. It merely

follows the simple command given it by its master (typically

something along the lines of Kill anyone who enters this room)

until destroyed or its targets disappear from view. A skeleton

ignores foes it cant see, and has no ability to discern between

vulnerable foes and ones resistant to its attacks.

Round 1: Charge toward the nearest foe, attacking if within

reach.

Rounds 2 and Later: Attack the nearest foe.

Round  1:  Attack  with  incorporeal  touch,  likely  with  sur-

prise.

Rounds 2 and Later: Concentrate attacks on energy-drained

or Constitution-drained foes.

Vampire or Vampire Spawn

While the vampires strategy seems simplecreate vampires

or  vampire  spawn  by  draining  the  victims  Constitution  or

levelits tactics can vary wildly based on the abilities it had

in life. While all vampires enjoy a certain level of stealth, some

rely on it far more than others. Regardless, a vampire picks its

targets (and opportunities) with care, rarely entering combat

without planning ahead. Spellcasting vampires typically fortify

themselves with protective or enhancing magics before entering

a  ght. Vampire spawn are more straightforward, because they

retain none of the special abilities they possessed while living.

They often gang up on foes to maximize the impact of their

energy drain attacks.

Prior to Combat: Call forth children of the night to assist

in  combat.  Cast  spells  or  use  other  magical  preparations  as

appropriate.

Round 1: Dominate nonspellcaster to gain ally. Use minions

to harry spellcasters.

Round 2: Attack spellcaster with energy-draining slam.

Rounds 3 and Later: Stay mobile, picking off targets while

minions keep other foes busy. Flee if outmatched.

Wight

The wight uses its stealth to sneak up on unwitting victims,

using surprise to deliver slam attacks against  at-footed enemies.

Not quite as cunning as the ghoul, the wight nevertheless has the

ability to seek advantageous positions in a  ght, such as  anking

or upper ground. Wights rarely retreat from a  ght with living

creatures, since their hatred for all life consumes them.

Round 1: Attack with energy-draining slam.

Rounds  2  and  Later: Concentrate  attacks  on  weakened

foes.

Zombie

Like the skeleton, the zombie doesnt employ much in the way

of tactics. Assuming their master hasnt given them some other

command, most zombies simply attack any visible foe. Zombies

ignore invisible creatures and lack the intelligence to recognize

when their attacks are useless. A zombie  ghting an enemy with

displacement or damage reduction, for instance, just keeps  ail-

ing away even if its attacks fail to injure the target. If its target

drops or disappears, it moves to the next available foe.

Round 1: Charge toward the nearest foe, attacking if within

Spectre and Wraith

reach.

The spectre and the wraith employ very similar tactics, thanks

to  their  similar  capabilities.  Like  other  incorporeal  undead,

spectres  and  wraiths  have  tremendous  ability  to  attack  with

surprise. Typically, the only warning that one might have to a

spectres or wraiths nearby presence comes from animals reac-

tion to the creatures unnatural aura. Its high initiative modi er

presents the very distinct possibility that one of these creatures

might deliver two devastating incorporeal touch attacks before a

potential victim has a chance to react. The more powerful dread

wraith also uses Spring Attack to maintain a position of cover

whenever it isnt delivering an attack.

Rounds 2 and Later: Attack the nearest foe.

SPECIAL ATTACKS

Most  undead  are  de ned  by  their  special  attacks,  from  the

vampires penchant for drinking blood to the spectres energy

drain. This section covers the most common of those abilities,

discussing  their  impact  on  the  game  and  providing  further

explanation and guidance related to their use.

Ability Damage and Drain

foes ability scores. For some creatures (particularly incorporeal

the mummys slam attack). Table 71: Undead Ability Damage

and  Drain  summarizes  the  capabilities  of  some  of  the  most

common undead creatures.

Regardless of the cause, ability damage and ability drain are

potent weapons in the arsenal of the undead. In combat, these

abilities  function  as  enormous  equalizers.  Even  high-level

characters fear damage or drain to ability scores; in fact, these

effects may even be more frightening to higher-level characters,

because those characters may depend on high ability scores to

use some of their feats, spells, or items. A cleric who suddenly

loses several points of Wisdom may  nd some higher-level spells

uncastable. Furthermore, since ability scores dont increase at

a rate comparable to hit points, a high-level character may be

nearly as vulnerable to ability damage or drain as a low-level

character. The Wisdom score of a 12th-level  ghter probably

isnt signi cantly higher than that of a 1st-level  ghter, mean-

ing that they are equally likely to fall comatose from an allips

Wisdom drain.

Ability-damaging or draining undead work best in groups,

though this tactic is most appropriate for intelligent and/or

lawful undead. While a single allip or wraith might not last

long  enough  to  endanger  a  PC,  two  or  three  teaming  up  on

that  PC  can  dramatically  shorten  the  characters  expected

lifespan. Dont overdo itif three dread wraiths surprise the

party, they could easily kill a character in a single round with

their Constitution-draining incorporeal touch attacks. Thats

not fun; its just mean.

For  another  nasty  trick,  couple  ability-damaging  or  drain-

ing undead with other monsters whose attacks are resisted by

the same ability score. The allips Wisdom drain may not seem

threatening to many characters, but if theyre simultaneously

subjected to spells or effects requiring Will saves, theyll quickly

notice the results. Wraiths that coexist with poisonous creatures

(such  as  venomous  snakes  or  monstrous  vermin)  make  their

prey all the more vulnerable to those creatures toxic attacks.

Be  careful  that  you  dont  overuse  ability  damage  or  drain,

particularly when characters lack the ability to heal such effects

after the  ght. After battling a pack of shadows, the characters

may well  nd themselves far less capable of taking on the next

foe, even if that foes Challenge Rating is relatively low. If the

characters must face consecutive ability-damaging or draining

encounters, even those who have prepared for such  ghts may

run out of resources.

Death

The bodaks death gaze is rightfully terrifying, even with its

relatively low save DC. By the time PCs are likely to face the

CR 8 bodak, only those characters with poor Fortitude saves

have a signi cant chance of failing the save. Still, the fact that a

single bungled roll can spell doom for a character is a frightening

prospect for most players. However, you can ramp up the save

DC by giving the bodak the Ability Focus feat for its death gaze,

and perhaps adding in a Charisma-boosting ability. An increase

of more than a point or two to the save DC could well merit a

+1 increase to the bodaks Challenge Rating.

The banshee (from Monster Manual II) also has a death attack.

Some uninformed souls mistakently believe lich possesses a

death touch, but these are undoubtedly the same ones who have

buried or left behind their paralyzed but all-too-alive comrades

(see Paralysis, on the next page).

Disease

The powerful slam attacks of a mummy deal plenty of damage,

but the real threat comes from the supernatural effect known

as mummy rot. As much a curse as a disease, mummy rot sets

in quickly (incubation period 1 minute), its save DC is pretty

challenging considering the mummys CR, and the effect of a

failed save (1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha damage) dramatically impacts

a characters survivability. Worse yet, a character suffering from

mummy rot resists the effects of healing magic. Characters with-

out access to break enchantment or remove curse can look forward

to a lingering, horrible death.

Other  undead  creatures  that  have  disease  attacks  include

the abyssal ghoul, huecuva, and quth-maren (from Fiend Folio);

the vilewight (from Book of Vile Darkness); and the corpse rat

swarm, gravetouched ghoul, mummi ed creature, plague blight,

slaymate, swarm-shifter undead rat form, and tomb mote (from

Chapter 6: New Monsters).

Energy Drain

As  the  quintessential  special  attack  of  the  undead,  nothing

scares  a  team  of  player  characters  more  than  energy  drain.

The  acquisition  of  negative  levels  rapidly  and  dramatically

reduces a characters ability to win a  ght, while simultaneously

energizing the undead creature. Each negative level applies a

1 penalty on the victims skill checks, ability checks, attack

rolls, and saving throws, as well as causing the victim to lose

5  hit  points.  Worse  yet,  spellcasters  lose  a  spell  slot  of  their

highest-level spells.

Energy drain can quickly snowball. As the character becomes

less capable in combat, the undead foe gets tougher and lasts

longer,  allowing  it  to  make  more  energy-draining  attacks.

An unlucky PC (or one with poor tactics) can easily run out

of  time.  Characters  whose  negative  levels  equal  their  total

Hit Dice are instantly slain (and rise later as wights or other

undead monsters).

As  with  undead  that  can  damage  or  drain  ability  scores,

maximize the impact of energy-draining monsters by having

them team up against a single foe. While a single wight may not

pose much of a challenge to a mid-level  ghter, a trio of wights

ganging up on him can have that same  ghter calling for help

in a hurry. This tactic is most appropriate for intelligent and

lawful undead, which often work better in groups.

At low levels (before characters have ready access to restoration),

energy drain is particularly terrifying to characters. Twenty-four

hours after a battle with a wight, one or more characters are

looking at the distinct possibility of losing levelsperhaps the

single worst penalty (short of death) a character can suffer. Even

at higher levels, the PCs may well not have enough restoration or

greater restoration spells to go around, forcing some victims of

energy drain to make one or more saves or lose levels. Level loss

can create a signi cant drag on the campaign as the characters

suddenly become less capable of meeting the challenges before

them. Characters who  ee an energy-draining foe, lose levels,

and then have to go up against that foe again may  nd themselves

caught in a horribly repetitive loop.

Fear

It  makes  sense  that  one  of  the  chief  weapons  used  by  many

undead  creatures  is  fearpure,  unreasoning  terror.  A  lichs

fear  aura  is  relatively  weak,  affecting  only  creatures  of  fewer

than 5 HD and limited to a 60-foot radius around the lich, but

it still sends enough foes  eeing in terror. The mere sight of

a  mummy  can  paralyze  viewers  with  fear  regardless  of  their

Hit Dice, though thankfully the effect is short-term (though it

may prove to be long enough for the mummy to dispatch one

or more foes). The nightwalkers evil gaze has a similar effect

to viewing a mummy.

Other  undead  creatures  that  have  fear  attacks  include  the

death knight and the spawn of Kyuss (from Monster Manual II);

the crawling head and the ghostly visage (from Fiend Folio); the

eye of fear and  ame (from Book of Vile Darkness); and the dream

vestige, the mummi ed creature, and the wheep (in Chapter 6

of this book).

Paralysis

Ghouls (and their more powerful cousins, ghasts) are the poster

spawn for paralysis attacks. Despite the short duration of the

paralysis, the risk of being rendered helpless while within arms

reach  of  such  feral  creatures  proves  terrifying  even  to  many

high-level adventurers.

The mohrgs paralyzing tongue works well with its improved

grab  ability,  since  a  paralyzed  target  cant  resist  its  grapple

attempt. For best effect, a mohrg should begin its attack rou-

tine with a tongue attack, allowing it to use its slam against a

potentially paralyzed foe.

The lichs paralysis attack is the most insidious of all these

creatures. Not only is the effect permanent, but the target also

appears to be stone dead. Without a DC 20 Spot check or a DC

15 Heal check, paralyzed allies might well be left behind (or

worse yet, buried alive) without their friends ever realizing their

misdeed.

The mummy and nightwalker also utilize paralyzing attacks,

though in their cases, paralysis is a byproduct of a fear effect (see

Fear, above).

sessed special qualities.

Spellcasting

Some undead, most infamously liches, retain the spellcasting

capability they had in life. An undead spellcaster, particularly in

the case of an arcane caster, is tougher than a living spellcaster

of the same level (hence the increased Challenge Rating). The

creature typically gains immunities to many common effects,

including several that are anathema to low-Fortitude-save arcane

spellcasters, as well as a bushel of hit points thanks to the d12

Hit Die of the undead. When augmented by wise spell selec-

tion, an undead spellcaster can often seem nearly invulnerable

to adventurers. A vampire sorcerer with cats grace, mage armor,

and shield all active has a stupendously high AC, while a lich

cleric  anked by commanded undead servants is a formidable

foe indeed.

Still,  remember  that  an  undead  spellcaster  has  access  to

fewer  (and  less  potent)  spells  than  a  living  spellcaster  of  the

same  Challenge  Rating.  A  CR  16  lich  has,  at  best,  7th-level

spells at its disposal, while a CR 16 living spellcaster NPC has

8th-level spells. Effectively, an undead spellcaster trades some

of its offensive punch (in the form of higher-level spells) for

defensive capabilities. An undead spellcaster also likely bene ts

from increased ability scores, granting additional bonus spells

and higher save DCs.

Undead spellcasters also suffer from the normal vulnerabili-

ties of their type, though they can (and should) use their spells

to counteract some of these. Undead clerics should use desecrate

or unhallow to decrease the risk of being turned. False life gives

an undead arcane caster some well-needed extra hit points.

The  bane  of  all  undead,  disintegrate,  deserves  singular

attention. Four (nonexclusionary) options exist for an undead

spellcaster worried about disintegration. First, it can increase

its touch AC, such as with cats grace, haste, or similar effects, but

this is rarely enough to protect against a ranged touch attack

from a reasonably powerful foe. Second, it can take advantage

of  concealment  or  miss  chances,  such  as  those  provided  by

blur,  displacement,  entropic  shield,  or  invisibility.  This  is  a  good

all-purpose choice, since it works equally well against foes of

all levels, though many effects (see invisibility, true seeing) can

bypass some or all of them. Third, it can improve its Fortitude

save, though without a Constitution score doing this can prove

dif cult. Protection from good, protection from spells, and even the

lowly resistance spell can help in this regard, as does a cloak of

resistance or even the Great Fortitude feat. The fourth and perhaps

most effective method of protection is simply to negate the spell

entirely, whether through spell resistance, greater spell immunity,

or judicious use of counterspelling.

Sunlight Vulnerability

A number of powerful undead possess vulnerability to sunlight,

though the effect of that vulnerability varies. Table 73: Undead

and  Sunlight  summarizes  the  interaction  between  various

undead creatures and sunlight.

Regardless of the effect, the cause remains the same: direct

exposure to the light of the sun. Re ected sunlight, whether

via  a  mirror  or  the  moon  itself,  has  no  effect  on  an  undead

creature vulnerable to sunlight. Cloud cover or similar inter-

ference does not protect the undead creature unless it is thick

enough to provide concealment to the creature. For example, a

vampire within a fog cloud spell would not adversely be affected

by sunlight. Even thick clothing, as long as it covers the body

completely, can protect an undead creature from the dangers

of sunlight. (Of course, that doesnt help incorporeal creatures,

which cant wear clothing.)

A powerless undead creature cannot attack, nor can it

use any extraordinary or supernatural special attacks. It is

treated as being slowed.

One round after exposure to sunlight begins, a vampire

that remains exposed is destroyed utterly.

Turn Resistance

Many  undead  possess  turn  resistancea  value  added  to  the

undead  creatures  Hit  Dice  when  resolving  the  effect  of  a

turning check. Normally, only the creatures HD dictates how

easy or dif cult it is for a cleric to turn or rebuke it. In some

cases, however, undead are speci cally designed to be harder

to  turn  than  normal  for  their  HD.  Such  creatures  have  turn

resistance. (See the turn resistance ability description in the

Monster Manual, or the Improved Turn Resistance feat on page

27 for more details.)

If a ghoul, for example, did not have turn resistance, it would

be no more dif cult to affect with a turning check than a typi-

cal 2 HD zombie, even though the ghouls Challenge Rating

indicates that it should be twice as tough as such a zombie.

Turn resistance is particularly important for undead that pos-

sess special abilities that drive their Challenge Rating higher

than their HD. If an undead creatures CR (which de nes the

typical level at which it is encountered, and thus the typical level

of the cleric attempting to turn it) is higher than its HD, it can be

too easy for clerics to turn unless it also has turn resistance.

INCORPOREALNESS

Incorporealness  is  so  often  misunderstood  and  has  so  many

unique  factors  that  it  merits  its  own  discussion.  Incorporeal

creatures are among the most complicated in the game to run.

With the addition of a single word to the  rst line of a creatures

statistic block, the creatures capabilities change dramatically.

This primer on dealing with incorporeal creatures in your game

aims to help handle this complex issue.

Monster Manual Text Explanation

Italic text is taken directly from the description of the incorporeal

subtype in Monster Manual III, and it is followed by text that

explains the in-game impact of that information.

An incorporeal creature has no physical body.

Incorporeal creatures dont need to eat, drink, or breathe, and

indeed cannot do these things (since they cant affect physical

objects, even air).

It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons

or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or

supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms.

An  incorporeal  creature  simply  has  nothing  to  fear  from

most  mundane  corporeal  opponents.  You  cant  hit  it  with  a

sword, claw, or arrow, nor can you burn it with a torch, acid,

or alchemists  re. You cant bury it, drown it, or trap it. If you

dont have magic at your disposal, your only realistic option when

facing an incorporeal creature is to  ee the scene.

Incorporeal creatures also cant bene t from magical effects

that require physical contact or manipulation of objects, from

a bulls strength spell to a potion of invisibility.

Incorporeal  creatures  can,  however,  be  affected  normally

by  the  natural  attacks  of  other  incorporeal  creatures.  An

incorporeal creature cannot occupy the same space as another

incorporeal creature.

Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to

ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy,

negative energy, force effects such as magic missile, or attacks made

with ghost touch weapons).

Sorcerers have an edge over other spellcasters against incor-

poreal creatures, since theyre almost certain to know (and have

available for casting) magic missile, and thus can bombard the

creature with 100% reliable attacks. Other good spells to use

include  the  various  Bigbys  hand  spells,  Mordenkainens  sword,

and spiritual weapon. However, unless the situation is desperate,

dont  waste   reballs  or  Melfs acid  arrows  on  an  incorporeal

creature.

Nondamaging spell effects affect incorporeal

creatures  normally  unless  they  require

corporeal  targets  to  function  (such  as

implosion) or they create a corporeal

effect  that  incorporeal  creatures

would normally be unaffected by

(such as a web or wall of stone

spell).  (This information does

not  appear  in  the  Monster  Manual,  but  is

part  of  the  updated  description  of  the

incorporeal subtype in Monster

Manual III.)

A spectre is just as vul-

nerable to control undead

as  a  mohrg  or  other

corporeal  undead,

since  the  spell

has  no  damag-

ing effects.

Although it is not

a  magical  attack,

holy  water  can  affect

incorporeal undead, but a hit with

holy water has a 50% chance of not

affecting an incorporeal creature.

Even  this  traditional  meth-

od of dealing with undead

creatures  isnt  reliable

against  unliving  incor-

poreal beings.

An incorporeal crea-

tures  attacks  pass

through  (ignore)  natu-

ral armor, armor, and

shields,  although  de-

 ection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work nor-

mally against it.

Other handy force-related defenses include the shield spell,

the ring of force shield, and bracers of armor. All these add to your

touch Armor Class against incorporeal attacks, as do any other

bonuses to Armor Class other than armor, shield, and natural

armor  bonuses.  This  makes  incorporeal  touch  attacks  less

effective overall than normal touch attacks, particularly against

arcane spellcasters who often rely on such defenses.

Nonmagical attacks made by an incorporeal creature with a melee

weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any melee attack an

incorporeal creature makes with a magic weapon against a corporeal

target has a 50% miss chance, except for attacks it makes with a ghost

touch weapon, while are made normally (no miss chance).

Incorporeal  creatures  must  deal  with  the  same  sorts  of

limitations on their ability to deal damage to corporeal targets

as corporeal attacks do when  ghting incorporeal foes.

Any equipment worn or carried by an incorporeal creature is also

incorporeal as long as it remains in the creatures possession. An object

that the creature relinquishes loses its incorporeal quality (and the crea-

ture loses the ability to manipulate the object). If an incorporeal creature

uses a thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes cor-

poreal as soon as it is  red and can affect a corporeal target

normally (no miss chance). (This information does

not appear in the Monster Manual, but is part of

the  updated  description  of  the  incorporeal

subtype in Monster Manual III.)

An incorporeal creature only shares

its incorporeal nature with objects that it

actually holds, carries, or wears. Once the

object  leaves  its  possession,  the  object

becomes corporeal.

Magic items possessed by an incorporeal

creature work normally with respect to their

effects on the creature or on another target.

Similarly,  spells  cast  by  an  incorporeal

creature  affect  corporeal  creatures  nor-

mally.  (This  information  does  not

appear in the Monster Manual, but

is part of the updated description

of the incorporeal subtype in

equal to its Charisma modi er (always at least +1, even if the creatures

Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus).

Incorporeal creatures often have better touch ACs than other

creatures of the same CR. This makes them more resistant to

touch attacks, including the ranged touch attack required by

spells  such  as  searing  light.  An  incorporeal  creature  with  a

high Dexterity, or a very small incorporeal creature, can prove

extraordinarily dif cult to hit.

An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but

must remain adjacent to the objects exterior, and so cannot pass entirely

through an object whose space is larger than its own.

This keeps wraiths and spectres from simply taking the short-

est route between any two points (including straight through

the planet!).

An incorporeal creature can occupy the same space as a solid

object, and typically gains cover from doing so. Compare the

size of the incorporeal creature to the size of the object, then

consult Table 74: Sharing Spaces to determine the extent of

cover (if any) enjoyed by the incorporeal creature.

An  incorporeal  creature  can  occupy  the  same  space  as  a

corporeal creature, unless that creature is entirely surrounded

by  a  force  effect  (such  as  mage  armor  or  bracers  of  armor).  An

incorporeal  creature  entering  a  corporeal  creatures  space

(or vice versa) provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for

moving  into  another  creatures  space.  It  must  then  succeed

with  an  incorporeal  touch  attack  (or  a  normal  touch  attack,

if the corporeal creature is the entering creature) against the

target to share the same physical space. If the target is helpless or

does not resist, no attack is necessary. If the attack succeeds, the

entering creature moves into the targets space. (This attack deals

no damage, even if the entering creatures touch attack would

normally deal damage.) If the attack fails, the creature returns

to the space it occupied before entering the targets space.

benefit is reduced to cover.

3 The incorporeal creature can ignore any armor bonus the

corporeal creature may have from force effects.

Total cover2



An incorporeal creature occupying the space of a corporeal

creature may gain cover, while the corporeal creature may gain

concealment (as shown in Table 74). For example, a shadow

sharing the space of an ogre gains cover, but the ogre gains no

bene t.  A  shadow  sharing  the  space  of  a  hal ing  grants  the

hal ing  concealment,  but  gains  no  bene t  itself.  A  shadow

sharing the space of a human gains cover, and the human gains

concealment. This cover or concealment even affects attacks

142

made by the other creature sharing the space (the shadow attack-

ing the hal ing takes a 20% miss chance for concealment, for

instance).

Either creature can end the sharing of a space simply by

moving away from that space. This leaves the incorporeal crea-

ture behind. If the corporeal creature moves more than 5 feet,

this movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for

leaving a threatened square.

It  can  sense  the  presence  of  creatures  or  objects  within  a  square

adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total concealment

(50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object.

In order to see farther from the object it is in and attack normally, the

incorporeal creature must emerge.

Even taking concealment into account, incorporeal creatures

often attack from inside objects, particularly when in darkened

areas (which evens the odds).

As the Dungeon Masters Guide indicates, an incorporeal crea-

ture hiding inside a solid object gains a +2 circumstance bonus

on Listen checks because solid objects carry sound well.

The  ability  to  detect  adjacent  foes  applies  even  when  the

incorporeal creature isnt inside an object.

An incorporeal creature inside an object has total cover, but when

it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature

outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks.

Incorporeal creatures work best when they remain mobile,

keeping characters from predicting when (and from where) the

next strike will come. (The Spring Attack feat is great for this

purpose.) If the characters begin to panic (or worse yet, to spread

out), the incorporeal creature can have a  eld day picking them

off one by one.

To  determine  if  an  object  is  large  enough  to  provide  total

cover, consult Table 74: Sharing Spaces.

An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.

Otilukes resilient sphere, Otilukes telekinetic sphere, and forcecage

are your best bets for entrapping (or walling off) incorporeal

creatures. Blade barrier and wall of force may seem like good ideas,

but remember that unless such effects completely surround the

opponent, the incorporeal creature can just  oat over (or under)

the barrier.

An incorporeal creature cannot enter the space of a creature

entirely protected by a force effect (such as mage armor or bracers

of armor).

An  incorporeal  creatures  attacks  pass  through  (ignore)  natural

armor,  armor,  and  shields,  although  de ection  bonuses  and  force

effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it.

Other handy force-related defenses include the shield spell,

the ring of force shield, and bracers of armor. All these add to your

touch Armor Class against incorporeal attacks, as do any other

bonuses to Armor Class other than armor, shield, and natural

armor  bonuses.  This  makes  incorporeal  touch  attacks  less

effective overall than normal touch attacks, particularly against

arcane spellcasters who often rely on such defenses.

Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily

as  they  do  in  air.  Incorporeal  creatures  cannot  fall  or  take  falling

damage.

An incorporeal creature that lives at the bottom of a water-

 lled pit can be an adventurers worst nightmare, since most

adventurers do not share this ability to move so freely under-

water or function without air.

Incorporeal creatures cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can

they be tripped or grappled. In fact, they cannot take any physical action

that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are

they subject to such actions.

This only applies against corporeal opponentsincorporeal

creatures  can  use  and  be  affected  by  these  tactics  in  combat

against other incorporeal creatures.

An incorporeal creature that attempts to physically manipu-

late another incorporeal creature uses its Charisma score instead

of its Strength score to determine the success of the attempt.

Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that

are triggered by weight. An incorporeal creature moves silently and

cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

An incorporeal scout is virtually indetectable.

It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modi er applies to both its

melee attacks and its ranged attacks.

Weapon Finesse has no effect on an incorporeal creatures

attacks, since it already uses Dexterity for attacks.

Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective

or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures.

In almost all cases, nonvisual senses are ineffective in detect-

ing or pinpointing incorporeal creatures; blindsense, blindsight,

scent, and tremorsense are all useless. If the incorporeal creature

chooses to make noise, it can be detected via normal hearing or

by blindsense or blindsight based on acute hearing. If a creature

possesses some other nonvisual sense, the DM should use best

judgment  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  that  sense  in

detecting an incorporeal creature, using the preceding infor-

mation as a guide.

Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move

at full speed even when they cannot see.

This  includes  the  concealment  provided  by  darkness,  fog,

water, and even when moving through solid objects.

Incorporeal vs. Ethereal

Many people confuse these two terms. Some of this confusion

revolves  around  the  ghost,  which  can  be  both  ethereal  and

incorporeal, depending on whether it has manifested.

An  incorporeal  creature  is  visible  but  cant  affect  (or  be

affected  by)  corporeal  objects,  except  as  described  above.  It

still exists fully on the Material Plane, despite its inability to

interact with most objects.

An ethereal creature exists not on the Material Plane, but on

the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps with the Material Plane at

all points. An ethereal creature is invisible and insubstantial. It

can see and hear creatures on the Material Plane, but everything

looks gray and ephemeral, and sight and hearing are limited to

60 feet. It cant interact with objects on the Material Plane in any

way. Even most of the limited options available to an incorpo-

real creaturesuch as ghost touch weapons and armordont

work for an ethereal creature, though force effects still affect it

normally (since those effects extend from the Material to the

Ethereal  Plane).  An  ethereal  creature  need  not  abide  by  the

incorporeal creatures limitation of remaining adjacent to an

objects  exterior.  Finally,  an  ethereal  creature  interacts  with

other ethereal creatures or ethereal objects as if both were on

the Material Plane.

Ghosts  are  ethereal  unless  they  manifest  on  the  Material

Plane.  A  ghost  on  the  Ethereal  Plane  is  not  incorporeal  and

can  affect  other  creatures  or  objects  on  the  Ethereal  Plane

normally.

A manifested ghost is incorporeal on the Material Plane, but

also remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where it can interact

with other ethereal targets normally. Its spells can affect targets

on the Material Plane as well, except for spells with a range of

Touch (ranged touch spells work normally).

Losing Incorporealness

An incorporeal creature that is forced to become corporeal (such

as by the new ghost trap spell; see page 65) loses all the bene ts

of incorporealness. Its body becomes physical, allowing it to

be harmed by weapons and other attack forms normally, even

if the attacks are nonmagical. Obviously, it can no longer enter

or pass through solid objects. It also loses its ability to detect

adjacent foes. Its weight is appropriate for a creature of its size

(when in doubt, assign a weight roughly in the middle of the

normal range for the creatures size category).

A creature that is forced to become corporeal loses any de ec-

tion bonus to Armor Class it had (unless the bonus is from a

spell, magic item, or similar effect not related to the creatures

incorporeal nature), and gains a natural armor bonus equal to

that de ection bonus. For example, a spectre that becomes cor-

poreal loses its +2 de ection bonus to Armor Class and gains

a +2 natural armor bonus to Armor Class. If that spectre were

under the effect of a shield of law spell when it became corporeal,

it would retain the +4 de ection bonus to Armor Class granted

by that spell, but its normal de ection bonus would still become

a natural armor bonus.

The now-corporeal creature gains a Strength score equal to its

Charisma score (not including any nonpermanent modi ers to

Charisma, such as an eagles splendor spell). Its incorporeal touch

attacks become normal touch attacks (and it uses its Strength

modi er on attack rolls unless it has Weapon Finesse).

A newly manifested corporeal creature is no longer silent, and

must make Move Silently checks as normal to move without

making noise. It can be detected or pinpointed normally with

nonvisual senses.

USING SAMPLE UNDEAD

The  Monster  Manual  presents  several  interesting  undead

templates for use in your campaign. However, these can prove

dif cult to use on short notice, since they require application

to an existing monster or character. If you need a special batch

of zombies or a nasty vampire and dont have suf cient time to

prepare in advance, just grab an appropriate monster from this

chapter and youre ready to go.

The sample undead presented in this chapter are ready to use

in your campaign. Each writeup includes full game statistics and

spell lists (as well as equipment and roleplaying notes for sentient

undead). Though the sample sentient undead are presented as

individuals, you can easily adjust the information to make the

creature more appropriate for your game.

Many of the creatures outlined in this chapter have similar

subtypes,  which  each  has  its  own  set  of  traits  (indicated  in

the Special Qualities section for all applicable creatures). For

complete descriptions of undead traits and incorporeal traits,

see the beginning of Chapter 6.

USING VARIANT UNDEAD

Literature and lore provide an endless variety of undead mon-

sters. Most are very similar to existing D&D monsters, but with

variations in abilities and characteristics that add an exciting

 avor. Rather than creating a brand-new monster from scratch,

you can simply apply one or more of the variants in this chapter

to existing creatures to design foes that feel very different to

the players. The variants use generic descriptive names to allow

easy identi cation, but you should consider giving them more

interesting names in your campaign.

Each variant includes a Challenge Rating adjustment. Add

together all the CR adjustments from the variants you apply, then

add the resulting sum to the creatures normal Challenge Rating

to  nd the new CR. Round fractions above 1 up to the next whole

number. For example, a fast human commoner zombie would

have CR 1 (1/2 + 1/2), while a fast hunter commoner zombie

would have CR 2 (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 is 1-1/2, rounded up to 2).

GHOSTS

This section offers ten sample ghosts, along with some variant

versions of the ghost.

Rest in Peace: Getting Rid of a Ghost

The Monster Manual points out that most ghosts have a tendency

to return to their old haunts unless a speci c wrong is set right.

In most cases, this means that including of a ghost in your cam-

paign requires you also to include the reason why it exists, and a

method by which characters can put it to rest permanently.

In general, the wrongs that lead to a ghosts existence fall

into two categories: wrongful actions performed upon the ghost

by others, or wrongful actions performed by the ghost upon

others. A ghost slain in cold blood falls into the  rst category,

while a murderer who becomes a ghost after death is an example

of the second.

10 Sample Wrongs to Put Right

1  The ghost (or someone it protected) was murdered in

cold blood. Bring the killer to justice.

2  The ghost (or someone it protected) was murdered in

cold blood. Bring the killer to the ghost.

3  The ghost (or someone it protected) was murdered in

cold blood. Destroy the killer.

4  The ghost (or someone it protected) was slain.

Return the slain individual to life.

5  Something guarded by the ghost was stolen.

Return the object to its rightful place.

6  The ghost left an important task un nished, such

as delivering a message, rescuing a lost individual, or

recovering a stolen item. Complete the task.

7  The ghost was a thief in life. Repay the victim(s) of the

ghosts crimes.

8  The ghost was a murderer. Apologize to the family/

descendants of the victim(s).

9  The ghost was a murderer. Bring the ghosts victim(s)

back to life.

10  The ghost committed a crime. Bring the ghost before

its victim(s) to apologize.

Depending on the style of your campaign, the reason a ghost

exists and the method for putting it to rest might vary from the

simple to the complex. If your campaign focuses on combat and

fast-paced action, the reason should be straightforward and the

method reasonably uncomplicated to complete (though it might

still be very dif cult). In a story-based campaign, determining

the reason for the ghosts existence, and the method by which

characters can put it to rest, might require signi cant research,

roleplaying, and legwork by the PCs. It could even become the

source of an entire adventure, campaign arc, or the campaign

itself.

SAMPLE GHOSTS

Most of the sample ghosts are described as speci c individuals,

though they can easily be made to  t your campaign by changing

just a few details. Each ghost includes a method by which it can

be put to rest permanently.

All  ghosts  in  this  section  share  the  following  two  special

abilities.

Manifestation (Su): Every ghost has this ability. A ghost

dwells  on  the  Ethereal  Plane  and,  as  an  ethereal  creature,  it

cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world.

When  a  ghost  manifests,  it  partly  enters  the  Material  Plane

and  becomes  visible  but  incorporeal  on  the  Material  Plane.

A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal

creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore

any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass

through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through

armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently.

A  manifested  ghost  can  strike  with  its  touch  attack  or

with  a  ghost  touch  weapon  (see  Ghostly  Equipment,  below).

A  manifested  ghost  remains  partially  on  the  Ethereal  Plane,

where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked

by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane.

The ghosts incorporealness helps protect it from foes on the

Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.

When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the

Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material

Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a

spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal

targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally

unless the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghosts touch spells

dont work on nonethereal targets.

A  ghost  has  two  home  planes,  the  Material  Plane  and  the

Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either

of these planes.

Rejuvenation  (Su):  In  most  cases,  its  dif cult  to  destroy

a  ghost  through  simple  combat:  The  destroyed  spirit  often

restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are

usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise

be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a successful level

check (1d20 + ghosts HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only

way to eliminate a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for

its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in

peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require

a good deal of research.

In  addition,  each  ghost  has  one  or  more  of  the  following

special abilities, as described in the statistics blocks below.

Corrupting Gaze (Su): A ghost can blast living beings with a

glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet the ghosts

gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of

damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage; save DC noted by

creature.

Corrupting Touch (Su): A ghost that hits a living target with

its incorporeal touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against

ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modi er to attack rolls

and damage rolls. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its

Dexterity modi er to attack rolls only.

Draining Touch (Su): A ghost that hits a living target with its

incorporeal touch attack drains 1d4 points from any one ability

score it selects. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals

5 points of damage to itself. Against ethereal opponents, it adds

its Strength modi er to attack rolls only. Against nonethereal

opponents, it adds its Dexterity modi er to attack rolls only.

Frightful Moan (Su): A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a

standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must

succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This

is a sonic, necromantic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that

successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the

same ghosts moan for 24 hours; save DC noted by creature.

Horri  c  Appearance  (Su):  Any  living  creature  within

60 feet that views a ghost must succeed on a Fortitude save or

immediately take 1d4 points of Strength damage, 1d4 points

of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be

affected by the same ghosts horri c appearance for 24 hours;

save DC noted by creature.

Malevolence (Su): Once per round, an ethereal ghost can

merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This abil-

ity is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghosts

Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require

a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be manifested

and it must try move into the targets space; moving into the

targets space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke

attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a

successful Will save (DC 15 + ghosts Cha modi er). A creature

that successfully saves cannot be affected by that same ghosts

malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the targets

space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the targets body;

save DC noted by creature.

Telekinesis (Su): A ghost can use telekinesis as a standard

action (caster level 12th or equal to the ghosts HD, whichever is

higher). When a ghost uses this ability, it must wait 1d4 rounds

before using it again; save DC noted by creature.

Ghost Ape

Ghost  apes  haunt  lost  cities  deep  in  tropical  jungles.  Some

served  the  citys  masters  during  life  and  now  guard  the  city

against intruders, while others may have been the victims of

necromantic experiments.

The method by which a ghost ape can permanently be put to

rest varies based on how you choose to use them in your game.

Those that serve as guardians of a location might continue to lurk

nearby as long as the location exists (that is, until the location

becomes completely destroyed, buried, or otherwise lost). Ghost

apes that are the result of horrible experiments might exist as long

as the means to recreate such experiments remain; characters

who destroy the laboratory, tome of knowledge, or other source

of the vile knowledge could free the ghost apes forever.

Many  other  animals  have  suf cient  Charisma  scores  to

become  full- edged  ghosts,  including  badgers,  bears,  cats,

cheetahs, dogs, elephants, eagles, hawks, horses, hyenas, leop-

ards, lions, mules, porpoises, ravens, tigers, whales, wolves, and

wolverines. Any of these creatures could make  ne low-level

ghosts for characters to encounter in haunted forests or ruined

villages.

Golgona, Ghost Medusa

Slain by a self-styled hero who wanted nothing more than her

head as a trophy, Golgona now haunts her former lair, dealing

death to those who would follow in her murderers footsteps. She

prefers to manifest in the midst of intruders, using her horri c

appearance and petrifying gaze to spread terror among her foes.

She picks off stragglers with her ghost touch shortbow and uses

telekinesis to drag  eeing enemies back within range of her

petrifying gaze or poison snakes.

She can only truly be put to rest by retrieving her head from

the manor of the hero who slew her, located in a city a few dozen

miles away. This may be dif cult, since the hero has since gained

status and is a respected member of the community.

Korath of the Haunted Pass

Korath  was  once  a  respected  elder  among  his  fellow  stone

giants. But then he became consumed by the need for power

and turned to evil. He was slain when he attempted to murder

the other elders of his tribe. The tribe has long since moved

on, but Korath remains behind, damned to live out eternity as

a ghost, haunting a lonely mountain pass.

Korath uses his telekinesis to hurl rocks at passersby, since

he has no physical ability to pick up and throw such objects on

the Material Plane. He employs his corrupting gaze on nearby

targets, and also uses his sorcerer spells to aid in combat.

He can be put to rest only by being allowed to apologize to

a member of his original tribe (or a descendant, depending on

how  long  you  decide  its  been  since  he  died).  The  tribe  lives

many miles away.

Laddy Bristerbuck, Forgotten Comrade

Laddy Bristerbuck was a happy-go-lucky sort of hal ing, indulg-

ing his natural curiosity through the pursuit of adventure. But

then  he  was  betrayed  by  his  comrades  and  left  behind  to  be

devoured by a blue dragon that inhabited the ruins of an ancient

moathouse. Though the dragon is now dead, the moathouse has

a new guardian: the ghost of Laddy Bristerbuck.

Laddy prefers trickery over confrontation, and uses telekinesis

to make trouble for those who disturb his peace. Thrown rocks,

characters pushed off balance at untimely moments, and other

such minor annoyances might cause intruders to believe that

they face a spellcaster or a group of invisible foes.

Laddys spirit can be put to rest by bringing some or all of

his three former comrades back to the moathouse to apologize

for their actions. Exactly who or where these comrades are is

up to the DM; they should probably be mid-level adventurers,

though  they  might  have  retired  from  action,  depending  on

how long ago you decide Laddys death occurred. For a truly

challenging task, one of the comrades might even have already

passed away!

An  incorporeal  creature  can  always  move  silently  if  it

chooses.

Evasion (Ex): If Laddy is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage, he

takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Laddy deals an extra 3d6 points of damage

on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked targets,

or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for

any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against

targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Laddy

may choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack,

but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such

as a sap (blackjack).

Telekinesis (Su): Will DC 17 negates; caster level 12th.

Trap  nding (Ex): Laddy can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magical traps (DC 25

+ the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Laddy retains his Dexterity bonus

to  AC  even  when   at-footed  or  targeted  by  an  unseen  foe

(he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise

immobile).

Possessions: Masterwork studded leather armor.

Narthal, Bane of the Deeps

For decades, the kraken Narthal ruled over her undersea terri-

tory. She brooked no competitors to her control, hunting down

and destroying all aquatic creatures that might have posed a

threat to her. She even claimed the oceans surface as her own,

dragging many a ship to a watery grave.

A few years ago, her reign was ended by a sahuagin baron, who

led an army of savage warriors against her. The waters frothed

red that day, and many sahuagin lost their lives in the con ict.

But Narthal died as well, and the baron claimed her territory

as his own. The remaining sahuagin settled there, and soon a

thriving community existed in the caverns once occupied by

Narthal and her slaves.

But  Narthal  returned  to  existence,  her  evil  not  so  easily

extinguished. However, to her surprise she found that she could

not approach to within a few miles of her former lairsome

unknown force kept her from wreaking vengeance upon her

slayers. She had to content herself with picking off occasional

patrols or lone wandering sahuagin. For their part, the sahuagin

know that they face some strange enemy, but dont yet realize

the full danger.

Though Narthal hates sahuagin more than any other creature,

she still sees herself as ruler of the entire region, and thus takes

on any intruders. At least two ships have been lost in the region,

and a survivor claims to have spotted a tentacled beast during

the attack.

Narthal can end her unlife only if the sahuagin presence in

her lair is ended. Should this occur, she lasts only long enough

to return to her caverns, then disappears forever.

New feats described in Chapter 2.

Constrict (Ex): A kraken deals automatic arm or tentacle

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a kraken must hit

with an arm or tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportu-

nity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can

constrict.

Ink Cloud (Ex): A kraken can emit a cloud of jet-black ink

in an 80-foot spread once per minute as a free action. The cloud

provides total concealment, which the kraken normally uses to

escape a  ght that is going badly. Creatures within the cloud are

considered to be in darkness.

Jet  (Ex):  A  kraken  can  jet  backward  once  per  round  as  a

full-round  action,  at  a  speed  of  280  feet.  It  must  move  in  a

straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while

jetting.

Skessak, Ghost Druid of the Swamp

Skessak was once a revered member of a powerful tribe of liz-

ardfolk. The product of a union between a green dragon and the

tribes shaman, Skessak was thought by many to be the natural

choice for the next tribal leader.

But then terror struck as the entire tribe was wiped out by

a mercenary force hired by a local lord to clear out the swamp.

Though he fought bravely, Skessak fell nonetheless. Somehow,

this scene of mass slaughter caused Skessak to become a ghost,

and now he roams incessantly through the swamp, attacking

any who dont belong. Despite being neutral in life, in undeath

Skessaks alignment has shifted to neutral evil.

Skessaks ghostly existence can be ended by bringing proof

of the unprovoked slaughter to the king, a powerful druid of

the region, or another appropriate authority.

Ssvissth, Lurker in Darkness

The  ghostly  illithid  Ssvissth  lives  in  its  own  personal  hell,

because it has been dead for so long it can no longer remember

what brains taste like. Sometimes it dreams of the grand cerebral

feasts of its life, but these visions only madden it further.

Cast out by its fellows for some long-forgotten slight, Ssvissth

now roams through the deep, dark places of the world, searching

for hapless creatures that it can destroy with its ghostly abilities.

It opens combat with a mind blast, approaching stunned foes

to use its horri c appearance and draining touch to  nish the

task.

Ssvissth can  nd eternal rest by devouring a single brain.

Unfortunately, the only creatures that it can target for such a

meal are other ethereal beings. Should Ssvissth be fortunate

enough to encounter a character who chooses to  ght it on the

Ethereal Plane, it focuses all its attention on that individual. If it

defeats an ethereal opponent, it quickly devours the foes brain,

then fades away satis ed.

An  incorporeal  creature  can  always  move  silently  if  it

chooses.

Extract (Ex): A mind  ayer that begins its turn with all four

tentacles attached and that makes a successful grapple check

automatically extracts the opponents brain, instantly killing that

creature. This power is useless against constructs, elementals,

oozes, plants, and undead. It is not instantly fatal to foes with

multiple heads, such as ettins and hydras.

Horri  c Appearance (Su): Fortitude DC 19 negates.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mind  ayer must

hit a Small, Medium, or Large creature with its tentacle attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,

it establishes a hold and attaches the tentacle to the opponents

head. A mind  ayer can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only

if it can somehow reach the foes head.

If  a  mind   ayer  begins  its  turn  with  at  least  one  tentacle

attached,  it  can  try  to  attach  its  remaining  tentacles  with  a

single grapple check. The opponent can escape with a single

successful grapple check or an Escape Artist check, but the mind

 ayer gets a +2 circumstance bonus for every tentacle that was

attached at the beginning of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): This psionic attack is a cone 60 feet long.

Anyone caught in this cone must succeed on a DC 19 Will save

or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. Mind  ayers often hunt using this

power and then drag off one or two of their stunned victims to

feed upon. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At willcharm monster (DC 19), detect thoughts

(DC 17), levitate, plane shift, suggestion (DC 18). Effective caster

level 8th.

Stronglimb, Spirit of the Woodlands

The  treant  known  as  Stronglimb  died  when  orc  marauders

burned him alive. This horrible death resulted in Stronglimb

returning as a ghost. Today, he serves as a guardian spirit for

his  former  forest  home,  possessing  despoilers  of  nature  by

way of his malevolence ability and using the captured hosts to

wreak vengeance upon others who would injure his beloved

woodlands.

Stronglimbs ghost can only be put to rest if it is proven that

the forest no longer needs his guardianship. For instance, if a

powerful druid or other character respectful of nature took the

forest under her careperhaps by setting up a stronghold within

it or otherwise proving her dedication to this causeStronglimb

would be able to depart forever.

Treants  have  a  +16  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks  made  in

forested areas.

Animate Trees (Sp): A treant can animate trees within 180

feet at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes 1 full

round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a

speed of 10 feet and  ghts as a treant in all respects. Animated

trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated them

is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is otherwise

similar to liveoak (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the

same vulnerability to  re that a treant has.

Double Damage Against Objects (Ex): A treant or animated

tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals

double damage.

Frightful Moan (Su): Will DC 16 negates.

Malevolence (Su): Will DC 18 negates.

Trample (Ex): Re ex DC 22 half.

Vulnerability to Fire (Ex): Stronglimb takes half again as

much (+50%) damage as normal from  re attacks.

Taryn Darena, Ghost on a Mission

In life, Taryn Darena served as a devoted cleric of St. Cuthbert,

god of retribution. Thanks to her wisdom and strong leadership,

she rose quickly through the ranks of the church. At the age

of 24, she was given the charge of overseeing the spiritual life

of the small town of Brightwater Reach. For three months, she

provided guidance and protection to the villagers, but then trag-

edy struck. A pack of savage murderers known as the Ravagers

pillaged the town, subjecting its inhabitants to unimaginable

torture and brutality.

Soon afterward, Taryn awoke as a ghost, with one thought

burning in her mind: retribution. The deaths of her  ock must

be avenged, and since that day she has committed herself to that

goal alone. Only the death of the leader of the Ravagersnow

a powerful warlordwill allow her spirit to rest.

But she cant complete the task without help. She requires

a living vessel to leave the ruins of Brightwater Reach. Many

times she has possessed promising individuals (sometimes with

their willing assistance, and sometimes not), but she has yet to

 nd the person who can help her gain vengeance against the

towns slayers. Should the PCs  nd themselves exploring the

burned-out rubble, Taryn attempts to possess a strong-looking

character (preferably a  ghter or barbarian, since they are less

likely to be able to resist her malevolence ability). If she succeeds,

she explains her plight to the other characters, but under no

circumstances does she agree to leave her host body unless the

PCs agree to help her in her quest. She isnt evil, only single-

minded, but her years of undeath have reduced her ability to

empathize with the needs of the living.

Xelkir, Deposed Tyrant

The beholder Xelkir once controlled all illegal activity in the

large city of Anatrope. From its lair deep beneath the streets, the

beholder oversaw a web of minions who ruled the underworld

with strict authority. No one, not even the citys leaders, dared

to cross Xelkir. But Xelkirs overcon dence proved its undo-

ing.  It  was  betrayed  and  slain  by  a  trusted  lieutenant,  an  elf

rogue/monk named Ash.

Now  Ash  rules  in  Xelkirs  place,  but  the  murder  of  the

beholder didnt prove as effective as the elf would have liked.

Instead,  Xelkirs  ghost  haunts  the  sewers  and  back  alleys  of

Anatrope, hunting down its former henchmen and minions.

Ash lives in secret terror of the creature, and keeps a number

of clerics well paid to protect him and his lair.

Obviously,  Xelkir  seeks  Ashs  death,  but  has  so  far  been

unable to accomplish this. Though the beholder attacks anyone

it encounters, savvy characters might be able to strike a deal

with it. If the elf crimelord is slain or otherwise deposed from

his position, the foul ghost can depart this existence.

tracks);  AlertnessB,  Flyby  Attack,  Great  Fortitude,  Improved

Initiative, Iron Will.

All-Around Vision (Ex): Beholders are exceptionally alert

and circumspect. Their many eyes give them a +4 racial bonus

on Spot and Search checks, and they cant be  anked.

Antimagic  Cone  (Su):  Xelkirs  central  eye  continually

produces a 150-foot cone of antimagic. This effect functions

just  like  antimagic   eld  (caster  level  13th).  All  magical  and

supernatural  powers  and  effects  within  the  cone  are  sup-

pressedeven the beholders own eye rays. Once each round,

during its turn, Xelkir decides whether the antimagic cone is

active or not (the beholder deactivates the cone by shutting

its central eye).

Corrupting Gaze (Su): Fortitude DC 19 negates.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of Xelkirs ten eye rays resembles a spell

cast by a 13th-level caster. Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet

and a save DC of 19. The ten eye rays include:

Charm Monster: The target must succeed on a Will save or

be affected as though by the spell. Beholders use this ray to

confuse the opposition, usually employing it early in a  ght.

The  beholder  instructs  a  charmed  target  to  either  restrain  a

comrade or stand aside.

Charm Person: The target must succeed on a Will save or be

affected as though by the spell. Beholders use this ray in the

same manner as the charm monster ray.

Disintegrate: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or

be affected as though by the spell. Xelkir likes to use this ray

on any foe it considers a real threat.

Fear:  This  works  like  the  spell,  except  that  it  targets  one

creature. The target must succeed on a Will save or be affected

as though by the spell. Xelkir likes to use this ray against war-

riors and other powerful creatures early in a  ght, to break up

the opposition.

Finger of Death: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or

be slain as though by the spell. The target takes 3d6+13 points

of damage if its saving throw succeeds. Xelkir uses this ray to

eliminate dangerous foes quickly.

Flesh to Stone: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or

be affected as though by the spell. Beholders like to aim this ray

at enemy spellcasters. They also use it on any creature whose

appearance they  nd interesting. (After the  ght, the beholder

takes the statue to its lair as a decoration.)

In ict  Moderate  Wounds:  This  works  like  the  spell,  causing

2d8+10 points of damage (Will half).

Sleep: This works like the spell, except that it affects one crea-

ture with any number of Hit Dice (Will negates). Beholders like

to use this ray against warriors and other physically powerful

creatures. They know their foes can quickly awaken the sleepers,

but they also know that doing so takes time and can delay an

effective counterattack.

Slow:  This  works  like  the  spell,  except  that  it  affects  one

creature. The target can make a Will save to negate the effect.

Beholders often use this ray against the same creature targeted

by their disintegrate,  esh to stone, or  nger of death ray. If one of

the former rays fails to eliminate the foe, this ray might at least

hamper it.

Telekinesis: Xelkir can move objects or creatures that weigh

up to 325 pounds, as though with a telekinesis spell. Creatures

can resist the effect with a successful Will save.

Horri  c Appearance (Su): Fortitude DC 19 negates.

GHOST VARIANTS

The list of special attacks in the Monster Manual allows for a

wide  variety  of  ghosts.  Here  are  two  more  variants  for  your

campaign.

Haunting Ghost

A haunting ghost lurks in foreboding, often deserted areas. Typi-

cally, it seeks to drive away all living creatures from its domain.

Though it has no ability to physically interact with corporeal

creatures, it can use its special abilities to control, frighten, or

even injure intruders.

In addition to the one or both of the special attacks described

below, a haunting ghost often possesses the frightful moan or

telekinesis abilities described in the Monster Manual. The caster

level for the abilities listed below is equal to the ghosts HD. Save

DCs are 10 + 1/2 ghosts HD + ghosts Cha modi er.

Special Attacks: Illusion (Su): A haunting ghost can create a

major image effect at will. It often uses this to craft horrifying

images of walking dead, pits of hell re, blood dripping from

the walls, and the like.

Suggestion (Su): A haunting ghost can make use a suggestion

effect once per hour. A target that successfully saves against this

power cannot be targeted again by the same haunting ghost for

24 hours.

CR Adjustment: +0.

Sagacious Ghost

Some ghosts possess vast stores of knowledge, making them

akin to an undead library. Depending on alignment, these ghosts

might offer information freely or at a dire cost.

Special Qualities: Lore (Ex): A sagacious ghosts lore ability

is the equivalent of the bards bardic knowledge class feature.

The ghost adds its HD and its Charisma modi er to the check

to see what knowledge it possesses.

Skills:  A  sagacious  ghost  has  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  1d4+1

Knowledge skills.

CR Adjustment: +0.

LICHES

This  section  details  six  liches  of  varying  backgrounds  and

challenges, from a goblin adept to a powerful archmage. It also

includes two variant liches.

The Lichs Phylactery

Every lich has a phylactery that stores its life force. Creation of

this phylactery is a prerequisite for becoming a lich. A phylactery

is extraordinarily expensive in terms of gp cost, XP cost, and

time to create. Do not count a phylactery as part of an NPC lichs

treasurepossession of the phylactery is considered as part of

the lichs normal Challenge Rating (though a PC lich, if you

allow such, must pay for its phylactery as normal).

A lich can construct only a single phylactery. A lich whose

phylactery is destroyed suffers no harm, but cannot construct a

new one. If a lich without a phylactery is slain, the lich is forever

destroyed. A phylactery in an antimagic  eld cannot recreate a

destroyed lich, though the lich returns to life 1d10 days after

the phylactery is removed from the area.

The phylactery of a lich usually takes the form of a sealed metal

box containing strips of parchment bearing magical phrases.

The phylactery can exist in other forms as well, though it must

either contain or bear an arcane inscription. Regardless of the

phylacterys form, its game statistics remain the same: size Tiny,

hp 40, hardness 20, break DC 40. As a magic item, it receives

saving throws against magical effects that can affect objects.

Its saving throw bonuses are equal to 2 + 1/2 the creators caster

level at the time of creation (or, if the phylactery is held or worn,

equal to the wearing creatures save bonuses, if higher).

Liches rarely carry their phylacteries with them, since this

would  result  in  the  easy  discovery  of  the  item  by  would-be

slayers. Most liches keep their phylacteries well-hidden (either

somewhere in their lair or in some other distant location, pos-

sibly  even  on  another  plane).  Most  liches  also  disguise  their

phylacteries with obscure object, nondetection, Nystuls magic aura,

sequester, or similar effects to prevent easy location by enemies.

Some employ guardians as well, preferring guardians that can

keep a secret (such as golems) or those willing to work without

asking too many questions. Under no circumstances does a lich

tell the guardian the true nature of what it guards!

An identify or analyze dweomer spell, or a DC 25 Knowledge

(arcana)  check,  can  identify  an  item  as  a  phylactery,  though

illusions or other trickery can potentially prevent such iden-

ti cation. A phylactery cannot be part of another magic item,

nor may additional magical properties be built into it.

10 Sample Phylacteries

1  A hollow silver sphere hanging from a silver chain and

containing strips of inscribed parchment

2  A gold ring bearing arcane inscriptions on the inside of

the band

3  A hollow gold sphere containing strips of inscribed

parchment, set atop a darkwood staff

4  An ivory box bearing arcane sigils across all six sides

5  A sealed clay jar containing strips of inscribed

parchment

6  A crystal cube with magical phrases carved on all six sides

7  A hollow platinum circlet containing tiny strips of

inscribed parchment rolled tightly inside

8  A gold-plated skull with magical phrases engraved upon

the teeth

9  An iron flask containing strips of inscribed parchment

10  A flawless diamond bearing tiny magical inscriptions,

set into a golden crown

SAMPLE LICHES

Each description includes roleplaying tips and information on

the lichs phylactery.

All liches share the following special abilities:

Fear Aura (Su): Liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of

death and evil. Creatures of fewer than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius

that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected

as though by a fear spell from a sorcerer of the lichs level. A

creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by that same

lichs aura for 24 hours; Will save DC given by creature.

Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature a lich hits with its

touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently

paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse

can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, page

203 of the Players Handbook). The effect cannot be dispelled.

Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot

check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive;

Fortitude save DC listed by creature.

Immunities (Ex): Liches have immunity to cold, electricity,

polymorph (though they can use polymorph effects on them-

selves), and mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Dallia Thistledown, Concealed Evil

Dallia Thistledown is the nicest little hal ing youd ever want

to meet. Shes kind and friendly, always greeting friends and

strangers  alike  with  a  beaming  smile  and  freshly  baked  cin-

namon rolls or tea cakes. Shes nice to animals and great with

children.  In  fact,  in  the  two  years  shes  worked  in  the  castle

kitchens, shes never uttered a cross word to anyone. Her songs

brighten the mood of anyone hearing them.

The hal ing who was Dallia Thistledown actually died three

years  ago  when  she  completed  the  process  that  transformed

her into a lich. Now she steals royal secrets for the kingdoms

enemies while posing as a humble cook. Of course, shes only

doing  that  to  gain  enough  wealth  and  power  to  take  over  a

kingdom for her own.

Dallia  is  best  introduced  to  the  PCs  at  low  levels,  when

her magic is easily potent enough to guard against accidental

discovery. As the characters gain levels, they become privy to

rumors  that  someone  has  been  selling  secret  information  to

enemies of the kingdom. Of course, shes smart enough to plant

red herrings, placing the blame on any of a number of others

(including  perhaps  the  PCs  themselves).  Shell  try  to  escape

rather than face a stand-up  ght, and might eventually turn up

in the service of another powerful enemy of the PCs.

Dallias  phylactery  is  typical  for  liches:  a  small  metal  box

containing strips of parchment. She has hidden it deep in an

unused  part  of  the  castles  dungeon,  with  its  magical  power

concealed by Nystuls magic aura. Her hoard of coins and gems

is hidden in the same placeshe only carries a few silver and

copper pieces in her disguise, along with her magic items (also

protected by Nystuls magic aura).

5,500 gp.

Durak the Eternal

A  lifelong  worshiper  of  Vecna,  God  of  Secrets,  Durak  knew

from an early age that he wanted to achieve eternal existence

as an undead being. He would have preferred vampirism, but he

didnt trust in his ability to escape the control of any vampire

that spawned him. He amassed power and knowledge quickly,

enabling him to achieve lichdom at the age of only 28.

Durak is now a relatively young lich, having experienced the

transformation mere months ago. He appears mostly human, if

a bit pale and sunken-eyed. He still venerates Vecna, and is busy

amassing an army of undead minions (his Leadership score for

the purpose of attracting followers is 18).

Duraks  phylactery  is  an  ornate  unholy  symbol,  which  he

wears in his lair but leaves behind (guarded by undead minions)

when he goes out in the  eld. He uses a standard, plainer one

for spellcasting and rebuking undead.

Durak makes a great archvillain for an arc of the campaign.

The PCs could run into his minions at lower levels or otherwise

hear stories of the evil cleric building a skeleton army. After

working their way through his defenses, they might meet Durak

either in his lair or on the battle eld itself.

Erl the Gaunt

Erl, nicknamed The Gaunt because of his weak, sickly appear-

ance, began his career as a lowly cleric of Wee Jas. Thanks to

long patience, he mastered the twin powers of magic and death.

But still Erl remained unsatis ed. Though he knew his life had

centuries left, he railed against the very thought of mortality. At

 rst he avoided the thought of lichdom, but eventually came to

the logical conclusion that there was simply no better option.

Erl has a vast array of spells at his beck and call. He prefers to

harass enemies with spells that entrap them or slow them down,

including acid fog, deeper darkness, Evards black tentacles, sleet storm,

wall of ice, and web. When pushed into a  ght, he focuses attention

on a single target, weakening his foe with summon swarm, ray of

enfeeblement, or feeblemind before using disintegrate, poison, or slay

living to  nish the enemy off. If the opportunity presents itself,

he targets groups with lightning bolt, greater command, or waves of

fatigue. Above all else, Erl is patient and willing to retreat from a

losing  ght, returning with a better selection of spells at a later

time. He has a contingency effect active at all times (if attacked

in melee, a blink spell is activated).

Erls phylactery is a metal plate that serves as the front cover

to one of his spellbooks, which are hidden in his lair. He casts

Nystuls magic aura on it every week or so to mask its aura.

Krilla Darkhand

The remorseless Krilla Darkhand may well be the weakest lich

in existence. As an adept, she doesnt have anywhere near the

magical power possessed by a typical lich. However, she makes

up for that with her tenaciousness, as well as a proactive attitude

about destroying that which is good and pure in the world.

Uninterested in hiding in a dark cave somewhere, waiting for

adventurers to come knocking on her door, Krilla instead works

as an assassin and bounty hunter. She has no allegiancesshe

killed  her  entire  tribe  as  a  mass  sacri ce  to  the  powers  of

deathand looks out only for herself. She uses her small size

to make foes think she lacks power, then unleashes her most

potent spells to ensure they dont make the same mistake (or

any other mistake) again.

Krillas phylactery is a tiny metal bauble that dangles from

her familiars collar. If Krilla fears death and cant escape, she

sends her familiar running (possibly using obscuring mist to hide

its retreat), so that she can return another day.

Krilla works best as a tough challenge for mid-level characters,

using stealth and surprise to give her an advantage. She isnt

powerful enough for a stand-up, fair  ght, and she knows that

well.

Kurlatt, Githzerai Lich

Kurlatt was once an up-and-coming member of a very successful

rrakkma (mind  ayer hunting party). A brush with death on

an otherwise routine mission forced him to reevaluate his pri-

orities. His own mortalitysomething that had rarely entered

his  thinking  before  thensuddenly  seemed  extraordinarily

fragile.  Quietly,  he  began  to  research  methods  of  extending

ones lifespan beyond the normal limits. Eventually, he stumbled

upon the secrets of lichdoma process much hated by most

githzerai,  since  the  githyankis  ruler  for  many  centuries  has

been  a  dreaded  lich-queenand  realized  that  this  was  what

he wanted. After mastering the necessary arcane arts, Kurlatt

completed his phylactery and ended his life, only to rise soon

afterward as a lich.

Kurlatt favors stealth and defense to overt attacks. He relies

on sneak attacks (using spells such as ray of frost, scorching ray, and

disintegrate) to dispatch his enemies. He also enjoys counterspell-

ing opponents magical attacks. His phylactery is a plain iron

circlet that he keeps hidden on the Astral Plane (ironically, not

far from a githyanki outpost).

Evasion (Ex): If Kurlatt is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage, he

takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Familiar: Kurlatt chooses not to summon a familiar, seeing

a potential familiar as more of a vulnerability than an asset.

Fear Aura (Su): Will DC 24 negates.

Inertial Armor (Sp): Githzerai can use psychic force to block

an  enemys  blows.  This  ability  gives  them  a  +4  armor  bonus

to Armor Class as long as they remain conscious. This is the

equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

Paralyzing Touch (Su): Fortitude DC 24 negates.

Psionics (Sp): 3/daydaze (DC 24), feather fall, shatter (DC

25). Kurlatt can use plane shift (DC 31) once per day, caster level

15th.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Kurlatt  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune

to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits  are  all  immune  to  sneak

attacks. Kurlatt may choose to deliver nonlethal damage with

his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for

that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trap  nding (Ex): Kurlatt can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magical traps (DC 25

+ the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Tevangia Zail, Archmage of Lichdom

The lich known as Tevangia Zail is an ancient creature of dire

evil. In life a powerful wizard who often sold her services to

kings and emperors, in undeath she has mastered the path of

the archmage. Lately, she has begun to experience something

resembling boredom. She lacks a challenge in her unlife, and

isnt sure how to rectify that. So few creatures can provide a

challenge to her magical prowess, after all.

Tevangias  phylactery  is  a  traditional  metal  container,

protected by nondetection (DC 21 caster level check to  nd by

divination).

Tevangia Zail typically has the following spells active upon

herself at all times, and their effects are included in the statis-

tics below as appropriate: detect scrying, false life (+15 hp), mage

armor (+4 AC), and moment of prescience (+20 insight bonus on

any single attack, opposed ability or skill check, or save). She has

a contingency spell that activates a stoneskin (damage reduction

10/adamantine) if attacked with a melee or ranged weapon. She

has also spent three wishes to increase her Intelligence score.

Tevangia can serve as an excellent new enemy for high-level

PCs.  If  she  hears  stories  of  their  power  and  fame,  she  might

simply show up on their doorstep (or in their study) and open

up with a full array of deadly spells. Alternatively, characters

might encounter her as advisor to a powerful evil ruler.

LICH VARIANTS

Liches are as varied as player characters themselves. Here are

two more variants for your campaign.

Good Lich

Though conceptually an oxymoron, the idea of a good-aligned

creature who chooses undead immortality over a normal lifespan

is a compelling one. Such creatures typically dedicate themselves

to some noble causeprotection of a sacred location, the tending

of knowledge or learning, and so forth.

Special Attacks: Turn Undead (Su): A good lich can turn

or destroy undead as a cleric of a level equal to its HD. (If the

good lich already has the ability to turn undead, treat it as if its

effective cleric level for turning was two higher than normal.)

Special Qualities: Turning Immunity (Ex): Good liches cannot

be turned or destroyed by good clerics, nor by neutral clerics who

turn undead. When neutral or evil clerics attempt to rebuke or

command a good lich, the lich is turned or destroyed instead.

A good lich retains the normal lichs fear aura, though it can

drop or raise the aura as a free action.

CR Adjustment: +1.

Lichfiend

The lich end is an evil outsider (usually a demon or devil) that

achieves lichdom. A lich end must have at least  ve at-will spell-

like abilities, the Craft Wondrous Item feat, and a caster level of

11 or higher to construct its phylactery. Eligible creatures from

the Monster Manual include the barghest (minimum 11 HD),

balor,  glabrezu,  marilith,  nalfeshnee,  succubus,  bone  devil,

horned devil, ice devil, and pit  end. The lich end retains all

the special abilities it had in life, and gains the typical abilities

of a lich except as noted below.

Special Qualities: A lich ends damage reduction is 15/good

and bludgeoning.

SKELETON VARIANTS

The skeleton is a staple of the fantasy genre, common to horror-

and action-style games alike. To add some spice to the skeleton,

try adding these variants to your game.

Fiery Skeleton

A  ery skeleton burns with unquenchable  ame. Variants of the

 ery skeleton include the lightning skeleton (deals electricity

damage, immunity to electricity) and the frost skeleton (deals

cold damage, immunity to cold).

Attack: A  ery skeletons natural attacks deal an additional

1d6 points of  re damage.

Special Qualities: Fiery skeletons have immunity to  re,

but do not have immunity to cold.

CR Adjustment: +1/2

Nimble Skeleton

A nimble skeleton can pursue characters across unsteady terrain,

rock walls, narrow ledges, and the like.

Initiative: A nimble skeletons initiative modi er increases

by 2 thanks to its improved Dexterity.

Speed: A nimble skeleton has a climb speed equal to its base

land speed.

Armor Class: A nimble skeletons Armor Class and touch

AC increase by 2 thanks to its improved Dexterity.

Abilities: A nimble skeleton gains an additional +4 bonus to

Dexterity.

CR Adjustment: +1/2.

Soldier Skeleton

The soldier skeleton works best in groups, and often originates

from mass battle eld graves. Soldier skeletons are always skeletal

humanoids, giants, or similar creatures.

Special Attacks: Cooperation (Ex): A soldier skeleton gains a +1

circumstance bonus to its attack rolls and Armor Class for each

other soldier skeleton that is adjacent to it. If a soldier skeleton

 anks an opponent, it gains an additional +1 circumstance bonus

on attacks against that opponent.

Feats: If a soldier skeleton wields a weapon, it has Weapon

Focus in that weapon as a bonus feat. The soldier skeleton also

gains Combat Re exes as a bonus feat.

CR Adjustment: +1.

Vicious Skeleton

Vicious skeletons seem to take mindless pleasure in disembowel-

ing their victims with their devastating claw attacks. Skeletons

without claws cant be vicious skeletons.

Attack: A vicious skeletons claw attacks deal damage as if

the skeleton were one size category larger than normal (if the

creature is already Colossal, the claw attack deals 3d8 points of

damage).

Special Attacks: Rend (Ex): If a vicious skeleton hits with at

least two claw attacks, it latches onto the opponents body and

tears  the   esh.  This  attack  automatically  deals  extra  damage

equal to twice the normal damage of a claw attack plus 1-1/2

times the vicious skeletons Strength bonus.

Feats: Vicious skeletons gain Improved Critical (claw) as a

bonus feat.

CR Adjustment: +1.

VAMPIRES

This section includes full statistics and roleplaying information

for ten different vampires, along with a few variant vampires.

SAMPLE VAMPIRES

Each  vampire  is  described  as  an  individual,  though  many

have generic statistics that can be used for any vampire of that

creature kind.

The vampires in this section all share the following special

abilities:

Alternate Form (Su): A vampire can assume the shape of a

bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability

is  similar  to  a  polymorph  spell  cast  by  a  12th-level  character,

except that the vampire does not regain hit points for changing

form and must choose from among the forms mentioned here.

While in its alternate form, the vampire loses its natural slam

attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons

and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain

in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise.

(If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow

other forms.)

Blood Drain (Ex): A vampire can suck blood from a living

victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it

pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution

drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful

attack, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up

to 1 hour.

Children of the Night (Su): Vampires command the lesser

creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat

swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard

action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might

summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive

in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.

Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous humanoid

slain by a vampires energy drain rises as a vampire spawn (see

Vampire Spawn on page 253 of the Monster Manual) 1d4 days

after burial.

If the vampire instead drains the victims Constitution to 0

or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD

and as a vampire if it had 5 or higher HD. In either case, the new

vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that

created it and remains enslaved until its masters destruction. At

any given time a vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no

more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would

exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire

spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn

of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser

vampires  in  this  fashion.  A  vampire  may  voluntarily  free  an

enslaved spawn to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire

or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.

Damage Reduction (Su): A vampire has damage reduction

10/silver and magic. A vampires natural weapons are treated

as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Dominate (Su): A vampire can crush an opponents will just

by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack,

except that the vampire must use a standard action, and those

merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets

must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the vampires

in uence  as  though  by  a  dominate  person  spell  (caster  level

12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet; Will save DC listed by

creature.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a vampires slam

attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess)

gain two negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, the

vampire gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

A vampire can use its energy drain ability once per round; For-

titude save DC to remove negative levels listed by creature.

Fast Healing (Ex): A vampire heals 5 points of damage each

round as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points

in combat, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts

to escape. It must reach its cof n home within 2 hours or be

utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) Any

additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form

has no effect. Once at rest in its cof n, a vampire is helpless. It

regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and

resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.

Gaseous  Form  (Su):  As  a  standard  action,  a  vampire  can

assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but

it can remain gaseous inde nitely and has a  y speed of 20 feet

with perfect maneuverability.

Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as

though with a spider climb spell.

Vampire Weaknesses: For all their power, vampires have a

number of weaknesses.

Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor

of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they

recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These

things dont harm the vampirethey merely keep it at bay. A

recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a creature

holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch

or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item

for the rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a

standard action.

Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although

they can be carried over it while resting in their cof ns or aboard

a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building

unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They

may freely enter public places, since these are by de nition open

to all.

Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampires hit points to 0 or lower

incapacitates it but doesnt always destroy it (see the note on fast

healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires.

Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can

take only a single move action or attack action and is destroyed

utterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly, immers-

ing a vampire in running water robs it of one-third of its hit

points each round until it is destroyed at the end of the third

round of immersion.

Driving a wooden stake through a vampires heart instantly

slays  the  monster.  However,  it  returns  to  life  if  the  stake  is

removed, unless the body is destroyed. A popular tactic is to

cut off the creatures head and  ll its mouth with holy wafers

(or their equivalent).

Baanmukh, Fiendish Minotaur Vampire

Deep in the Abyss, the demon lord Baphomet has spawned an

entire race of demon-blooded minotaurs. These  endish bull-

men  combine  the  ferocity  of  the  minotaur  with  the  magical

resistance granted by their demonic bloodline.

One  of  those   endish  minotaurs,  named  Baanmukh,  was

part of a strike force sent by the demon lord to  ght against the

minions of Orcus, a rival prince of the Abyss. The minotaurs

were overwhelmed by their undead opponents, and a few days

later Baanmukh rose as a vampire.

He has since gained freedom from enslavement and traveled

to the Material Plane, where he hunts his prey with unusual

cunning  (even  for  a  minotaur).  Characters  might  encounter

Baanmukh on his own, lurking in a dark forest or subterranean

network of tunnels, or as the leader of a gang of minotaurs that

treat him as a quasidivine being.

Dominate (Su): Will DC 14 negates.

Energy Drain (Su): Fortitude DC 14 to eliminate 24 hours

Natural Cunning (Ex): Although minotaurs are not espe-

cially intelligent, they possess innate cunning and logical ability.

This gives them immunity to maze spells, prevents them from

ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. Further,

they are never caught  at-footed.

Powerful Charge (Ex): A minotaur typically begins a battle

by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty

horns into play. In addition to the normal bene ts and hazards

of a charge, this allows the beast to make a single gore attack

with a +9 attack bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.

Izrok Radja, Drow Vampire

Most creatures that become vampires do so as the unwilling

victims of a horribly evil enemy. Not so with Izrok Radja. This

drow  necromancer  became  infatuated  with  immortality  as  a

bloodsucker during his early studies of undeath, and made it his

lifes mission to undergo transformation into a vampire.

Eventually, in a dark alleyway of the drow city of Erehei-Cinlu,

Radja got his wish. But the necromancer didnt plan on life as

a slave: the vampire that granted him eternal life met a quick

end at the hands of a group of mercenaries that the drow had

paid in advance of his death.

Now Izrok Radja roams the endless tunnels of the subter-

ranean world as a horrible undead creature. From time to time

he  visits  surface  cities  to  wreak  terror  on  the  locals,  only  to

disappear beneath the earth after a few days, weeks, or months

of destruction.

Karadag, Vampire of the Sea

The  sahuagin  priestess  Karadag  is  the  twelfth  in  a  line  of

vampiric lorekeepers of her tribe, dating back nearly a millen-

nium. When a young priestess passes a test of her knowledge

and ferocity, she is transformed, but only assumes the position

of responsibility by engineering the death of the vampire that

spawned her. Karadag spent a mere three years as an enslaved

vampire before arranging for her ascension. That was a decade

ago, and Karadag intends to remain in power for many more

years to come.

Karadag has the full respect of all sahuagin in her territory,

including even the prince whom she advises. In battle, she likes

to summon  endish sharks and send them to destroy her foes.

She usually has a contingent of 58 sahuagin around her at any

time to protect against strikes by rival tribes or aquatic elves.

Pyotar Umarov, Fallen Paladin

In life, Pyotar Umarov served as a respected paladin in the ranks

of the faithful of Heironeous. On an ill-fated mission to rid a

remote village of the predations of a powerful vampire, Pyotar

and his companions ran into more than they could handle. The

vampire, a mighty wizard, slew the entire band of warriors and

turned Pyotar into a vampire. Recognizing the dark potential

within Pyotar, the wizard summoned a foul demon to grant the

former paladin the powers of a blackguard.

Several months have passed since Pyotars death and rebirth,

but he remains an enslaved spawn of the vampire wizard. The

characters might encounter Pyotar as part of a mission to  nd

the missing paladin, or on an unrelated adventure. If possible,

Pyotar might try to trick the PCs into slaying his master to free

him from enslavement. Of course, Pyotar is now no less evil

than his master, so this might not be the best move.

Rafira, Vampiric Doppelganger Assassin

If you could go anywhere and be anyone, what would you do?

The accomplished doppelganger burglar and con artist Ra ra

discovered the answer to that question after accidentally sneak-

ing into the manor of a vampire. When she woke up two days

later, she found herself the vampires undead minion. Since then,

she has turned from petty theft to murder, killing those who

oppose her masters rise to power in the society, or anyone who

might learn the secret of his vampiric nature.

The characters might run afoul of Ra ra accidentally, by being

in the neighborhood of one of her hits. Alternatively, one of

them (or someone they know) could be a target of the deadly

killer.

or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for

any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against

targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, she discovers how

to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Riikos, Derro Vampire Savant

Theyll pay. Theyll all pay. Every one of them. The derro who betrayed

him, leaving him to the vampires mercy. Not just those derro, but all

derro everywhere. The human clerics of Pelor, who destroyed his master

leaving  him  all  alone.  But  not  just  those  humans,  but  all  humans

everywhere. Yes, all the derro and all the humans. Theyll all suffer

horribly, and then theyll die even more horribly.

Riikos is, if possible, even more insanely bloodthirsty than

a typical derro. His natural stealth has been augmented by his

transformation, making him extraordinarily dif cult to detect.

Riikos can be encountered by himself or with a pair of vampire

spawn,  who  might  be  of  derro  or  human  stock.  He  lurks  in

shadows, always searching for more victims.

derro restored to sanity gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6

points of Charisma.

Poison Use (Ex): Derro typically carry 2d4 doses of green-

Satoris, Vampiric Hunter

Before he died, Satoris served as part of a group of yuan-ti sent to

negotiate a treaty with a nearby den of vampires. The vampires

werent interested, and the yuan-ti were slaughtered.

Satoris  arose  days  later  as  a  vampire,  and  returned  to  his

people. But now he serves the vampires, not the yuan-ti abomi-

nation leading the tribe. He waits for the proper time to strike,

hoping to slay the abomination and cue an attack by the other

vampires.

The PCs might encounter Satoris as part of a gang of yuan-ti

hunters. If he thinks he can use the characters, he might forge a

deal to work together against his fellow serpent-folk. Of course,

hell betray the PCs as soon as its convenient.

Shamila Garrick, Vampiric Piper

For many years, Shamila Garrick was a beloved street performer

who specialized in entertaining children with her piping and

antics. Her disappearance nearly a year ago caused much sadness

among those of the city, but most assumed that she had simply

packed up and moved away, a victim of wanderlust.

Little did they suspect that the friendly gnome had actually

fallen victim to a horrible blood-drinking monster. When her

master was slain a few months later, the formerly kind-hearted

performer  became  a  free-willed  vampire.  Returning  to  the

streets where she was once loved, Shamila set her sights on the

most innocent and weak of prey: the children. Today, she uses

her vampiric powers and bardic abilities to sway the minds of

young victims, luring them into dark places where she sates her

hunger with their fresh blood. She avoids contact with adults

whenever possible, though shes fully capable of defeating even

a small squad of guards.

The most likely way for characters to encounter Shamila is

for them to be hired or otherwise tasked with tracking down

one  or  more  missing  youths.  If  the  characters  have  children

of their own, they might even  nd themselves on the trail of a

loved one. For a particularly horri c twist, the PCs might have

to  ght their way past vampire spawn created from Shamilas

young victims.

Skrall, Vampiric Gargoyle

Skrall was once the leader of a wing of gargoyles. When a pack

of vampires moved into Skralls part of the city, the gargoyles

reacted instinctively to defend their hunting grounds. Skrall

didnt count on the vampires superior cunning, and the pack was

soon torn to shreds. Instead of death, Skrall was given undeath,

and now serves as a hunter for the vampire that spawned him.

Skrall can be encountered in any city of reasonable size. He

prefers to target lone travelers, rendering such prey unconscious

before bringing them back to his master. Alternatively, he may

have gained freedom from enslavement, in which case he works

well as a deadly threat for low-level characters.

to notice the gargoyle is really alive.

Possessions: 6,500 sp, 700 gp, 8 gems (200 gp each).

Sadistic in life, the harpy becomes evil personi ed when turned

into a vampire. With its captivating song, a harpy vampire can

easily lure dozens of innocent victims to their deaths, leaving

only a pile of blood-drained corpses.

Zenami is a typical harpy vampire. She lurks in the marshes

outside a small city, luring unwary travelers or explorers to an

early grave.

Zenami:  Female  harpy  vampire;  CR  6;  Medium  undead

Captivating  Song  (Su):  The  most  insidious  ability  of  the

harpy is its song. When Zenami sings, all creatures (other than

harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 18 Will

save or become captivated. This is a sonic, mind-affecting, charm

effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by

Zenamis song for 24 hours.

A captivated victim walks toward Zenami, taking the most

direct route available. If the path leads into a dangerous area

(through  ame, off a cliff, or the like), that creature gets a second

saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no actions other

than to defend themselves. (Thus, a  ghter cannot run away or

attack but takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet

of Zenami stands there and offers no resistance to the monsters

attacks. The effect continues for as long as Zenami sings and

for 1 round thereafter. A bards countersong ability allows the

captivated creature to attempt a new Will save.

Dominate (Su): Will DC 18 negates.

Energy Drain (Su): Fortitude DC 18 to eliminate 24 hours

later.

Possessions: two tanglefoot bags, potion of invisibility, 4,500 sp,

900 gp, 4 gems (average value 350 gp).

VAMPIRE VARIANTS

Legends abound of vampires that possess strange or unfamiliar

abilities. These variants can be applied either to the vampire

template or to the vampire spawn creature entry.

Moonbane Vampire

A moonbane vampire is vulnerable to the light of the full moon.

A moonbane vampire exposed to the light of the full moon is

treated as slowed (Will DC 15 negates). If the moon is waxing

or waning (that is, not yet or no longer full), the vampire can

still be affected, but it gains a +4 bonus on its save. A moonless

night has no ill effect on the vampire.

Persuasive Vampire

A  persuasive  vampire  uses  the  power  of  its  speech  to  sway

opinions of listeners.

Special Attacks: Suggestion (Su): A persuasive vampire can

make a suggestion to any number of targets within 30 feet (Will

negates). This is the equivalent of a suggestion spell (caster level

12th). The vampire can pick and choose which targets to affect

with the ability.

The persuasive vampire loses the dominate special attack.

CR Adjustment: +0.

Psychic Vampire

A  psychic  vampire  drains  a  victims  mental  strength,  rather

than physical health.

Special  Attacks:  Wisdom  Drain  (Su):  With  a  successful

touch  attack  or  slam  attack,  a  psychic  vampire  drains  1d6

points of Wisdom from the target, and simultaneously gains

5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour. It can do this

once per round. In addition, each living creature within 10 feet

of a psychic vampire takes 1 point of Wisdom drain per round

(Will negates; DC 10 + 1/2 vampires HD + vampires Cha modi-

 er). A psychic vampire does not gain any temporary hit points

from this effect. A psychic vampire can suppress or reactivate

its Wisdom-draining aura as a standard action.

A psychic vampire does not have the vampires energy drain

ability.

CR Adjustment: +0

Savage Vampire

A savage vampire has none of the traditional vampires person-

ality or persuasiveness, instead relying on brute force. Rather

than acting as charismatic leaders, savage vampires form packs

much as wolves do.

Attack: A savage vampire retains all the attacks of the base

creature and also gains two claw attacks if it didnt already have

them. (Creatures without hands gain slam attacks instead, as

normal for a vampire.)

Bloodthirsty Zombie

The bloodthirsty zombie doesnt just want to destroy you, it wants

to crack open your skull and feast on the goo inside.

Attack: A bloodthirsty zombie gains a bite attack that deals

the same damage as its slam attack (or its normal bite damage,

whichever is more). (Bloodthirsty zombies also have a slam attack

as normal, but most dont use it.)

scores a critical hit with its bite against a living creature, that

creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage.

corpse?

against a diseased zombie is similarly exposed (a character who

grapples with a diseased zombie gets a 4 penalty on the save

made to resist infection).

CULTS OF UNDEATH

Whether symbolized by the seductive nature of the vampire or

the sheer power of the lich, the undead have an undeniable draw

to the living. Over the centuries, innumerable cults, conclaves,

and organizations have sprung up dedicated to or led by the

walking dead. Five such groups are detailed below for inclusion

in your game. Each description includes notes on incorporating

the cult into your campaign, as well as a sample NPC af liated

with the group.

ACADEMY NECROMICA

The Academy Necromica was founded nearly one hundred and

 fty years ago by the necromancer Xilian, who sought to estab-

lish a place where like-minded individuals could come together

and share the secrets of the dark arts. Over the next two decades,

Master Xilian slowly built up the organization, hand-picking

members from those who respected (or worshiped) the power

of death and undeath. Soon she had a cadre of necromancers,

evil priests, and professional killers.

But the Academy was in ltrated by a paladin/rogue named

Rion, who used his knowledge of the groups inner workings

to organize an assault by those who opposed them. Most of the

Necromicans (as the Academys members call themselves) were

destroyed, and Xilian herself was on deaths door when loyal

minions spirited her away.

From the ashes of the Academys worst failure came its  rst

great success. Unable to repair Master Xilians horribly broken

body,  the  necromancers  instead  performed  an  unspeakable

process  upon  her,  turning  her  into  a  lich.  With  a  newfound

lease  on  unlife,  Xilian  swore  vengeance  upon  her  enemies.

She knew that patience was her ally, and over the next century,

quietly built up a secret but powerful organization dedicated to

death and evil. Now, the time to strike approaches near, yet she

hesitates, fearing the possibility of another setback.

Today, the Academy Necromica prides itself on its strict

dedication  to  evil  above  petty  politics,  and  thus  remains

basically  neutral  evil.  Individual  members  may  vary  from

this  ideal,  but  the  Academy  itself  rarely  strays  into  either

lawful or chaotic methods. Symbolic of this ideal is Xilian,

the Master of the Academy and a powerful necromancer in her

own right. As the organizations founder and most powerful

member, Xilian is possessed of a patience born of more than a

century of unlife. She does not take unnecessary risks, though

she also knows the value of personal involvement in times

of crisis. She spends most of her time teaching the students

of the Academy, as well as crafting long-range plans for the

organizations future.

As one might expect, the Academy welcomes both the living

and the dead, and it numbers a few undead (vampires, spectres,

and the like) among its membership. To join, one must only

demonstrate an appreciation for the arts of death, whether that

appreciation is scholarly or more...hands-on.

to the Undying Toughness feat; see below).

In Your Campaign

Special Qualities: An unkillable zombie gains fast heal-

ing 5.

Feats: An unkillable zombie gains Improved Toughness (see

page 27) as a bonus feat.

CR Adjustment: +1

Unless you run an evil-oriented campaign, the Academy Nec-

romica probably works best as an adversary for your PCs. The

characters might come across rumors of a ring of graverobbers

or bodysnatchers, which in turn could lead them to discover

the Academys more vile activities. Alternatively, the Academy

might target one of the PCs as a likely candidate for vampirism

or similar undead transformation, counting on the alignment

shift to make the character friendlier to their aims. Or maybe

one or more characters are aligned with the forces that brought

Xilian and her Academy down the  rst time. If you have a non-

good necromancer PC in the group, the Academy might even

attempt recruitment, but only after con rming the characters

alignment.

Its probably best not to pit the character directly against the

Academy at lower levels. The higher-ranking members (such as

Xilian or Uther Kyush, described below) could certainly defeat a

low-level party of adventurers singlehandedly, and neither would

hesitate to eliminate a serious threat to the organization.

Sample Member

After Master Xilian, the most respected member of the Academy

is Uther Kyush, who oversees all targeted slayings, illicit infor-

mation gathering, and other criminal activities of the Academy.

Most Necromicans value Kyushs personal involvement in the

day-to-day workings of the Academy, seeing him as much more

in touch with the rank-and- le membership than Xilian. Kyush

employs  two  squads  of  spies  and  cutthroats,  each  comprised

of three 1st-level rogues and led by a 2nd-level rogue. Kyush

is  rarely  separated  from  his  bodyguard/lover  Ronica  (female

Death Attack (Ex): If Uther studies his victim for 3 rounds

and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon, he can

attempt or paralyze his victim for 1d6+5 rounds or kill it (For-

titude DC 16).

Elf Traits: Elves have immunity to magic sleep effects. An

elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door

is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if he were actively

looking for it.

Evasion (Ex): If Uther is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage, he

takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Poison Use (Ex): Uther never risks accidentally poisoning

himself when applying poison or positoxin to a blade.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Uther deals an extra 6d6 points of damage

on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked targets,

or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for

any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against

targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Uther

may choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack,

but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such

as a sap (blackjack).

Trap  nding (Ex): Uther can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magical traps (DC 25

+ the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Uther retains his Dexterity bonus

to  AC  even  when   at-footed  or  targeted  by  an  unseen  foe

(he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise

immobile).

EYES OF VECNA

Though the members of this order claim it was founded by the

lich Vecna before his ascension to godhood, this declaration

seems apocryphal. Regardless of the truth, members of this order

venerate the deity of secrets as their divine patron. Their aim

is to keep knowledge out of the hands of those undeserving to

have it. At the lowest levels, this takes the form of the theft (or

destruction) of books and scrolls from personal libraries, but

can include kidnapping and murder if necessary.

The Eyes of Vecna is organized into cells of 4d6 members.

Most large cities and metropolises have one (or sometimes more

than one) cell secreted somewhere within them, but individual

cells maintain their independence from one another regardless

of geographical proximity. Cell leaders are usually evil necro-

mancers or diviners or clerics of Vecna, typically of level 5th or

higher. Rogues and bards are common members, and the order

numbers many warriors, experts, and  ghters among their ranks

as well.

Above the cells sit more powerful leaders, who orchestrate

the activities of cells throughout a region (often without the

cells even realizing they are being in uenced by an outside

power). These leaders are typically level 10th or higher, and

some are undead creatures themselves (such as vampires or

liches). These leaders often use weaker undead as lackeys or

bodyguards, since such creatures tend to be good at keeping

secrets. Stories that the organizations leaders amputate their

left hands and put out an eye to ascend to this level of power

are unproven.

To  join  the  Eyes  of  Vecna,  one  must  prove  ones  worth  by

stealing or destroying an item of forbidden knowledge (such as

a rare tome). Characters of evil alignment are strongly preferred,

since the Eyes of Vecna must never place the well being of others

before the groups own nefarious goals.

As  a  result  of  their  activities,  the  organization  has  a  vast

storehouse of rare knowledge, which grants a +2 circumstance

bonus on Knowledge checks. Members of 5th level or higher

can gain access to this resource by making a DC 15 Charisma

check and spending a full 8 hours going through the tomes.

In Your Campaign

The Eyes of Vecna make a great long-term opponent for the

PCs  of  your  campaign.  At  low  levels,  the  characters  might

unintentionally thwart the theft of a rare book from a temple

or aristocrats library, gaining the thanks of the owner and the

attention of the Eyes. Later, characters tasked with recovering

stolen property or  nding a kidnapped sage could trace their

way to a cells headquarters, perhaps even quashing the cell

itself.  This,  of  course,  draws  the  ire  of  the  higher-ranking

members,  which  might  make  the  PCs  the  next  target.  At

higher  levels,  the  characters  could  tangle  with  the  leaders

themselves.

Sample Member

Cyranthus is a cell leader working in a large city or metropolis

in your campaign world. He prefers subtle approaches to his

goals, favoring stealth over brute force. His cell includes rogues,

bards, a sorcerer, and a few warriors, as well as a pair of zombie

bodyguards animated by Cyranthus himself. Unlike many cell

leaders, Cyranthus has no illusions about his level of authority,

and dreams of joining the higher ranks of the Eyes. This ambi-

tion leads him to plan ever-larger missions for his cell, which

could be his undoing.

Half-Elf Traits: Half-elves have immunity to magic sleep

effects. For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered

an elf.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Cyranthus deals an extra 1d6 points of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

LURKERS IN SHADOW

This cult is relatively new to the world, having formed about a

decade ago by the mystic theurge DMilluhr. According to his

claims, DMilluhr received a vision from a shadowy demonic

undead being of great power. In this vision, the theurge was

tasked with an unholy quest for a terrible artifact: the dreaded

Wand of Orcus.

Since that day, DMilluhr has worked tirelessly toward that

end. He knew instinctively that this quest must remain secret

from the world at large, and has thus kept to the shadows, never

extending his reach too far. He has enlisted a small group of

allies to this cause, including rogues, diviners, and planewalking

characters of all stripes. He has also attracted the service of a

few visages, though in truth he doesnt know why these undead

beings offered their allegiance to him.

The truth, should DMilluhr ever learn it, would likely shat-

ter his sanity. The vision was neither a message nor a divine

quest,  but  merely  a  quirk  of  fate,  an  echo  of  the  thoughts  of

the  undead  deity  Tenebrous  (see  page  18)  when  it  came  into

being on the Astral Plane. The visages (see page 130) came to

DMilluhr because they sensed some connection between the

theurge and their creator, Tenebrous. Worse still, the quest itself

is a meaningless one, since the being known as Tenebrous has

regained his lost wand and returned to his previous identity,

Orcus, Demon Prince of Undead.

But DMilluhr suspects none of this, and remains feverishly

intent on recovering the lost Wand of Orcus. He tracks down

almost every lead, no matter how vague, which leads him on

innumerable  wild  goose  chases  across  the  planes.  He  rejects

any suggestion that the Wand is in the hands of Orcus himself,

clinging to the theory that his shadowy patron wouldnt have

bestowed a quest as hopeless as taking the Wand from the hands

of the Demon Prince of Undead himself.

In Your Campaign

DMilluhr or his minions could run into the characters on any

of a number of information hunts. The PCs need not be involved

with  Orcus,  Tenebrous,  or  indeed  anything  even  vaguely

related to the Lurkers mission. As long as some tenuous link

between the characters activities and the theurges quest can

be imagined, an encounter between the PCs and the Lurkers

in Shadow can occur.

Or  perhaps  DMilluhrs  quest  isnt  as  crazy  as  it  seems.

Maybe hes actually getting close to tracking down the Wands

current destination (and perhaps it isnt currently in Orcuss

hands), and the PCs learn of his goal and decide to head him

off before he gains possession of one of the most evil artifacts

in all creation.

Sample Member

Tarek  Duskwood  is  one  of  DMilluhrs  most  competent  and

loyal minions. He operates both as a lone spy or as the leader

of a group of rogues and  ghters tasked with following up on a

lead, depending on the needs of the theurge. Though he appears

harmless and friendly, his true personality is coldly vicious. Put

simply, Tarek will destroy anyone in the way of his goal, and he

prefers methods that are unnecessarily painful.

MINIONS OF THE SKULL

To the average person on the street, the Minions of the Skull

would seem insane. Of course, the Minions know that their

worship  of  all  undead  beings  is  the  one  true  way  of  moving

beyond the petty concerns of  esh and blood to achieve perfect

immortality everlasting.

As  it  turns  out,  the  person  on  the  street  would  be  right:

the  Minions  of  the  Skull  are  absolutely  insane.  However,

this insanity makes them all the more dangerous, since they

have no compunction against destroying any living creature

who poses even the slightest threat to their goals of universal

undeath.

The Minions of the Skull have no centralized leadership or

organization.  Each  group  of  cultistswhich  might  number

anywhere  from  a  half-dozen  to  several  dozen,  depending  on

the community and the personality of its leaderoperates on

its own, though occasionally charismatic leaders unite multiple

branches for particularly daring or grand schemes. Such alli-

ances rarely last very long, since the innately chaotic nature of

the cultists inevitably proves too strong to control.

As expected, the Minions draw the attention of many sentient

undead creatures. Most dont have the foresight to use the Min-

ions effectively, either spending them in foolish strikes against

the living or merely consuming them as food. However, wiser

undead (including liches, vampires, ghosts, mummies, and the

like) may use the Minions as pawns in grander schemes.

Cult leaders, often called Undying Masters, are usually pow-

erful wizards or sorcerers. Since the cult doesnt venerate any

of the traditional deities (save for a few who quietly worship

Vecna  the  lich-god),  clerics  are  few  and  far  between.  They

typically employ  ghters, monks, or rogues as bodyguards,

promising  these  individuals  transformation  into  powerful

undead  creatures  as  reward  for  loyal  service.  An  Undying

Master  that  has  already  achieved  transformation  into  an

undead uses its new status to gain even greater respect and

awe from other minions.

In Your Campaign

The Minions of the Skull make great foes for PCs. Since theyre

irrevocably vile and evil, most characters have few compunctions

about cutting them down by the dozens. However, no matter how

many the characters defeat, a few more insane cultists always

wait in the wings to give them a hard time.

A typical encounter with low-ranking Minions might occur

when the PCs run across (or are hired to stop) a group of cultists

stealing various relics linked to deities of death. For a twist, have

an evil temple, such as one dedicated to Nerull, hire the PCs to

work together against the cult. As the characters learn more

about the Minions of the Skull, they encounter ever-tougher

cultists until they  nally meet an Undying One himself.

Sample Member

Tival is a typical low-ranking member of the Minions of the

Skull. Trival is a brutal thug who moves at the will of higher-

ranking members of the organization.

THE RUBY ORDER

This  cult  worships  Wee  Jas,  particularly  her  incarnation  as

Deaths  Guardian.  The  members  pride  themselves  on  their

dedication  and  discipline  and  are  known  widely  for  their

expertise in necromantic magic.

The existence of the Ruby Order in a given city is typically

public  knowledge.  The  cult  respects  whatever  government

rules the land, follows the law, pays taxes, and so forth. It draws

many arcane-minded characters to its ranks, and even more

seek out the Order for short-term teaching. In some cities, the

Order supplies advisors to local leaders, or even magistrates for

the courts. Characters used to dealing with cults as secretive

bands of renegades are in for trouble if they treat the Ruby

Order similarly, since it has many allies, both legitimate and

otherwise.

In Your Campaign

Of the cults presented here, the Ruby Order is the best suited

as an ally to a typical group of PCs. As a lawful neutral organi-

zation, the Ruby Order can be counted on to hold up its end

of any bargain, making it a reliable source of information and

other resources to a like-minded party. Monks, lawful wizards

and  sorcerers,  and  other  characters  who  share  a  devotion  to

discipline  can   nd  acceptance  or  even  training  among  the

orders ranks.

Conversely, the Ruby Order can be a steadfast opponent to the

PCs of your campaign, particularly if those characters tend more

toward chaos than law (or even if they simply have a distaste

for necromancy). If the Ruby Order perceives the characters as

enemies, they have the will and patience to make the PCs lives

a living hell.

Sample Member

Marys is a new member of the Ruby Order, and seeks to prove

her worth to the cult by forbidding herself all earthly plea-

sures. Unfortunately, her discipline is not yet strong enough

to achieve this goal. After her periodic binges, she absolves

her guilt by smiting those who tempted her. For best effect,

characters  should  encounter  her   rst  while  in  her  ascetic

mode, to set her up as a disciplined individual, only to meet

her later in the midst of debauchery or while striking down

her tempters.

ADVENTURE SITES

The following locales provide lairs and adventure sites that focus

on themes of necromancy, from lower-level sites to higher.

NUCHARS TOMB

This site is suitable for a party of 4th-level adventurers.

Few remember Nuchar. Nuchars family was wealthy, and

of noble blood, so when her questionable pursuits brought her

low, her family hushed it up, and by virtue of merely sealing

over her underground laboratory, which quieted the phantom

screaming,  muf ed  the  unseen  footsteps,  and  lessened  the

horrible shadows that sometimes appeared in the corners on

the family estate.

This was not enough to save the family. A year and a day

after Nuchars laboratory (now called Nuchars Tomb by the

family) was sealed, a strange sickness struck the family, kill-

ing them all in mere hours. Afterward, the house, for all its

grandiosity,  would  not  sell.  It  fell  into  disrepair,  and  still

stands abandoned today. Nuchars Tomb remains a name of

mystery and horror. Stories of the wealth sealed away with

Nuchar have also grown as time has passed. The stories might

even be true.

Those who seek Nuchars Tomb must navigate the decrepit

house,  nd the secret stairs, and descend to Nuchars Foyer.

1. Nuchars Foyer (EL 3)

Three feet of water  lls this stained stone chamber. The water

is stagnant, and a horrible stench assaults all who enter. Dark

green and opaque in even the brightest lamp-light, the water

covers  rough   ooringbroken  stone  crockery,  vessels,  and

 asks,  as  well  as  strangely  preserved  humanoid  bones.  The

water  laps  up  against  a  great  iron  seal  leading  to  room  2,

which is trapped.

Fire Trap on Seal to Room 2: CR 3; spell; proximity trigger

(alarm); no reset; spell effect ( re trap, 3rd-level druid, 1d4+3  re,

Re ex DC 13 half); Search DC 27; Disable Device DC 27.

2. The Seal (EL 2)

The door between this room and room 1 takes the form of a great

iron disk, 8 feet in diameter. It was once black, but contact with

the water in room 1 and this room has painted great stripes of

rust across it. The door is locked (Open Lock 21) and trapped.

The trap effects a 20 x 20 foot section in room 1 immediately

next to the seal.

Like the foyer, this room is also three feet deep in opaque

stagnant water. It hides a remnant of Nuchars researchthe

animate  skeleton  of  an  owlbear.  The  skeleton  rises  up  and

attacks  any  creature  that  passes  the  midpoint  of  the  room

toward room 3.

A search through the water reveals similar detritus as that

found in room 1.

Owlbear Skeleton (1): hp 32; see Monster Manual.

3. The Square (EL 3)

A wide hallway provides access to all Nuchars experimentation

rooms.  Faint  fungal  phosphorescence  lights  this  chamber.  A

black lichenlike growth covers every surface above the water

level (which is still 3 feet deep and just as stagnant).

A Search (DC 21) of the hallway reveals a rusted iron chest

beneath the water. The locked (Pick Lock DC 23) chest holds 3

diamonds each worth 50 gp and 3 leaky (ruined) potion vials.

However, if removed from the chest, three tomb motes that lie

sodden and unmoving suddenly swim to the surface of the liquid

and attack the intruders.

Tomb Motes (3): hp 13; see page 128 of this book.

4. Abandoned Lab

Beneath the ever present water can be found shattered glass vials

and tubes, corroded metal tools rusted beyond repair, spools

of dark thread, and an enormous number of humanoid bones,

some still strapped to upended metal tables. Nothing moves in

the two chambers keyed to this entry.

5. Bone Assembly Room (EL 5)

This room, also  ooded, contains the bones of large or huge crea-

tures, strewn and disassembled. Also ruined bone drills, twine,

and shattered crockery once  lled with vile substances. Of the

creatures created in this lab, one ettin skeleton remains. It rises

from the bone jumble to attack any that enter the chamber.

A search of the room reveals a cabinet that the water has not

breached. Inside the cabinet is a pouch with 200 gp, a  ask of

alchemists  re, two  asks of acid, a vial of holy water, a vial of

unholy water, and an hourglass.

Ettin Skeleton (1): hp 65; see Monster Manual page 227.

6. Skinning Chamber (EL 5)

The door to this chamber is locked (Open Lock DC 23). Inside,

the  oor slopes upward toward the southeast, and that corner of

the room is not  ooded. A jumble of tables and fallen cabinetry

that lie in the  ooded part of the room are mixed with scalpels

of  all  sizes,  and  other  rusted,  broken  ensing  equipment.  In

the corner of the room stands the shape of a human with no

features,  like  a  manikin.  However,  the  manikin  seems  to  be

covered in a patchwork of leathery skin. However, those who

enter the chamber may be surprised when the patchwork skin

lifts into three  apping sheets of animate skin, which kite for-

ward through the air to attack. A featureless stone sculpture

remains behind, the skin kites roost.

Skin Kites (3): hp 24; see page 119 of this book.

7. Cracked Crucible

The  oor is higher here, and hardly any of the room is under

water, though the cracked cobblestones are moist and thick with

fungus.  Tables  here  are  overturned  an  broken.  A  thick  glass

crucible  lies  on  the   oor  near  the  eastern  wall.  It  is  cracked

open, and a strange black growth has exploded out of the cavity,

sending rhizomes of webbing across the ceiling.

This  is  a  physical  manifestation  of  a   esh0eating  bacillus

Nuchar was developing. Anyone who enters more than 10 feet

into  the  chamber  feels  must  make  a  Re ex  save  each  round

(DC 15) to avoid a glop of the stuff coating the ceiling from

dropping  down  upon  them,  potentially  infecting  them  with

the lethal disease. Inside the crucible from which the physical

manifestation of the disease grows is a 500 gp black pearl, which

serves as a magical nexus for spells that nurture the disease.

Flesh-Eating Bacillus Disease: Contact; Fort save DC 20;

Onset time 1 day; Damage 1d6 Con. The black growth covers the

victim, slowly  lling in the portions of the victims  esh where

rot has created cavities. Someone suffering from  esh-eating

bacillus is contagious with contact.

8. Nuchars Room (EL 7)

Steps raise the majority of this room well above the  ood level.

Nuchars black lacquered altarlike cof n lies in the southern

portion of this room. When a particularly vile spell snapped

the thread of Nuchars life, her corpse revived, in the form of a

deathlock. As a deathlock, Nuchar sometimes stalks the con nes

of  this  level,  but  has  never  ventured  past  the  seal.  Creatures

entering the room wake her and her pets. When intruders

come  into  this  room,  she  realizes  the  seal  is  breached.  After

dealing with intruders, she will venture forth.

In her cof n can be found 340 gp, a small gold bracelet (55

gp), matching gold earrings (30 gp), and Nuchars Spellbook.

of Nuchars mother, drowned by her

daughters hand. The curse of that act

caused the well to go bad. The mothers

spirit lingers as a murk. If the murk

is  killed  the   ood  of  stagnant  water

is stopped.

THE BARROW

This  adventure  site  is  suitable  for  a

party of 6th-level adventurers.

A barrow is a large mound of earth above an old tomb. As

the passage of years roll on, the earth is grown over with grass,

giving the mound the look of a simple hill.

Barrows are found in many places, usually marking the spot

of ancient peoples now long vanished. Often, barrows are let

lie, since they may be haunted by the spirits of those buried

within.

1. Top of the Mound (EL 6)

The grassy mound is has a small bald spot of earth and bare

stone on top; tomb raiders have recently discovered this mound

could be a barrow, and have uncovered the ancient stone door.

The massive stone slab covering the opening is fastened from

within with a cross brace (Strength check DC 28 to break) and

trapped.

Lightning Bolt Trap: CR 6; magic device; proximity trigger

(alarm); automatic reset; spell effect (lightning bolt, 10th-level

wizard,  10d6  electricity,  Re ex  DC  14  half);  Search  DC  28;

Disable Device DC 28.

2. False Barrow (EL 4)

Once  broken  into,  the  hollow  stomach  of  the  barrow  is

revealed.  The  sandy   oor  of  the  barrow  lies  some  20  feet

below the opening.

A search of this sandy space reveals detritus in the form of old

bones, rotted rags that may have once been cloths, beads, and a

few bits of crude coinage of an ancient vintage (33 gp in total).

Searching the sandy  oor uncovers one unpleasant surprisea

skulking cyst.

A more thorough search of the  oor (Search DC 25) reveals a

trapdoor hidden under the sand, which covers a narrow earthen

stair leading downward to room 3.

Skulking Cyst (1): hp 26; see page 120 of this book.

3. Defenders of the Barrow (EL 6)

The narrow earthen stair from room 2 empties into a chamber

that smells awful. A single closed sarcophagus lies in the center

of  this  darkened  chamberthis  is  the  entrance  to  the   nal

descent that leads to room 4. The smell seems to come from

the closed sarcophagus. This is normally true, but the plague

blight that wiles away the centuries is alerted when the cross

brace holding the entrance is bypassed or broken (see room1).

It removes itself form its bed, puts the lid back on, then hides

in a corner (Spot check 34), and attempts to take from behind

creatures opening its sarcophagus.

Plague Blight (1): hp 41; see page 115 of this book.

4. True Barrow (EL 8)

The 20 foot high space measures 40 feet in length and 60 in

breadth.  Every  10  x  10  foot  section  of  the   oor  contains  an

eroded  stone  sarcophagus,  for  a  total  of  24  sarcophagi.  The

names imprinted upon the top of each of the elaborate cof ns

are mostly lost to mildew, save for a few decipherable names,

written in a now-dead tongue.

Each  sarcophagus  contains  some  bit  of  treasure  (roll  on

the  barrow  sarcophagus  contents  table),  but  when  the  rst

sarcophagus is breached, the guardian spirit of the barrow

is summoned up out of the earth. The  rst evidence of the

spirits arrival is its dire melodythe spirit takes the form

of a crypt chanter.

FANGHURST

This site is suitable for a party of 7th-level adventurers.

Below large cities, powerful undead sometimes congregate,

forming groups, associations, and cabals. Where undead cabals

meet, evil plans are plotted and set into motion. One of these

cosmopolitan  lairs  is  known  as  Fanghurst.  Here,  the  Three

Principles,  as  they  call  themselves,  organize  thievery,  incul-

cate  themselves  with  dark  forces,  and  seek  to  increase  their

in uence in the city.

1. Entry (EL 3)

This  chamber  is  found  at  the  bottom  of  a  circular  stair  well

that proceeds from a secret entrance from somewhere on the

surface (the DM customizes the particulars of this according

to the needs of the game).

The entry is bare, but for the stairs and double stone doors

on the north wall, and a metal chair on which sits the door-

tenderan ogre. The doors are locked (Open Lock DC 27), and

are only unlocked from the inside (room 2) if the doortender

ogre calls and gives the proper password. A commotion in this

room alerts the ogres in room 2 that intruders are present, and

they prepare themselves.

Ogre (1): hp 29; see Monster Manual.

2. First Defense (EL 8)

The doors to this room that connect onto room 1 are locked

(Open Lock DC 27). While the Three Principles of Fanghurst

are undead (see room 7), even undead sometimes rely on living

servants to better ensure their safety. Thus, the Three Principles

employ ogres, garnering their services through a combination

of pay and fear.

At any given time, three of the  ve ogres assigned to guard

this room are in the chamberthe other two arrive at the end

of the  rst round of any altercation, one from room 4, the other

from room 3.

Ogres (5): hp 29; see Monster Manual.

3. Barracks

A large oaken table and chairs occupy the center of the room.

Various-sized bone dice litter the table. Crude straw pallets (6

total) line the walls, crowding the table. A search through the

room reveals the personal valuables kept by the ogres435 gp,

three alexandrite gems each worth 200 gp, a spare large steel

shield, and a misplaced potion of cure medium wounds.

If  by  chance  the  ogres  in  the  outer  chamber  have  been

bypassed, a single ogre is found here sleeping.

4. Storeroom

An ogres got to eatpoor quality foodstuffs and water barrels

are crammed into this room, plus a barrel of rancid ale, allowing

the ogres to go months at a time without leaving their post.

If  by  chance  the  ogres  in  the  outer  chamber  have  been

bypassed, a single ogre is found here sneaking a sip from the

ale barrel.

5. Second Defense (EL 6)

Frescoes along the wall of this wide hall are painted in ochre

hues. The frescoes depict scenes of intruders coming to grisly

ends by way of terrible traps.

There are two traps in this room, one in the south of the hall,

the other in the north of the hall. Entering the trapped areas

shown on the Fanghurst map triggers these traps.

South Flame Strike Trap: CR 6; magic device; proximity

trigger (detect magic); automatic reset; spell effect ( ame strike,

9th-level  cleric,  9d6   re,  Re ex  DC  17  half);  Search  DC  30;

Disable Device DC 30.

North Fusillade of Spears: CR 6; mechanical; proximity

trigger; repair reset; Atk +21 ranged (1d8, spear); multiple targets

(1d6 spears per target in a 10 ft.-by-10-ft. area); Search DC 26;

Disable Device DC 20.

6. Third Defense (EL 8)

The sounds of traps going off in room 5 arouses the guardians

in  this  chamber4  vampire  spawn.  Two  of  these  creatures

attempt to set up an ambush by dropping from the ceiling onto

the  rst opponents into the chamber. The other two spring from

hiding from the secret doors leading to their crypts once battle

is joined.

If by chance the adventurers come upon this chamber without

raising a ruckus, one vampire spawn can be found reclining in a

crude wooden cof n, one each behind the four secret doors. A

search of the four mini-crypts behind each of the secret doors

reveals the following valuables in sum: 570 gp, 3 black opals

worth 1,000 gp apiece, a gold-plated goblet (320 gp). One of the

vampire spawn wears a ring of protection +1.

A search of this room also reveals a lever that deactivates the

traps in room 5.

Vampire Spawn (3): hp 29; see Monster Manual.

Vampire Spawn (1): AC 16 (ring of protection +1); hp 32; see

Monster Manual.

7. Inner Sanctum (EL 10)

The door to this chamber connecting from room 6 is locked

(Open Lock DC 30) and trapped.

Chain Lightning Trap: CR 7; magic device; proximity trig-

ger (attempt to unlock door without key); automatic reset; spell

effect (chain lightning, 11th-level wizard, 11d6 electricity to target

nearest center of trigger area plus 5d6 electricity to each of up

to eleven secondary targets, Re ex DC 19 half); Search DC 31;

Disable Device DC 31.

The  inner  sanctum  is  tiled  in  obsidian,  and  everburning

candles (10) line the periphery of the room. Three slate podiums

stand near the center of the circular chamber, encompassing

an inscribed summoning circle on the  oor, picked out in red

lacquer. Here, the Three Principles convene three nights out

of  ve to discuss their current plots, devise new ones, or work

especially evil rituals.

The  Three  Principles  are  individually  called  Thraesus

(ogre  vampire),  Delock  (ogre  mage  7th-level  wizard  (nec-

romancer) vampire), and Myphosoles (ogre mage vampire).

Currently, Delock is on a mission and isnt expected back

for months.

Any sort of  ght in room 6, or the setting off of the trap on

the door, alerts the Two Principles who remain at Fanghurst in

their retreats (rooms 10 and 12) and the guardian creatures in

the connecting room (room 8) that intruders are present.

The  vampires   ght  all  intruders,  though  will  fall  back  (in

gaseous form) to their secret retreats.

8. Ghoulcache (EL 4)

The Three Principles keep a gang of ghouls fed with the drained

bodies of their own feeding practices. The four ghouls here join

in any  ght in room 7. A search through the rooms horrible detri-

tus unearths 245 gold pieces and three black opals (250 gp).

Ghouls (4): hp 13; see Monster Manual.

9. Library

The  door  to  this  room  is  locked  (Open  Lock  DC  40).  Inside

are various books on necromantic lore. A search of the shelves

reveals a copy of the Nycoptic Manuscripts (see magic items,

page 79).

10. Delocks Chamber

Delock is on a mission, and has taken with him all his valuables

in the interim. His casket in the adjoining room is empty.

11. Thraesuss Chamber

A  litter  of  humanoid  skulls   lls  each  corner  of  this  cham-

berThraesus is an avid collector. A small stone table is home

to  a  pile  of  disorganized  parchmentsthe  sum  total  of  this

The casket in the adjoining room is locked (Open Lock DC

40) and contains 500 gp in a pouch.

12. Myphosoless Chamber (EL 8): Reaching this chamber

requires passing through a trapped area.

Melfs Acid Arrow Trap: CR 8; magic device; visual trigger

Melf s acid arrow traps); Atk +9 ranged touch and +9 ranged touch;

spell effect (Melf s acid arrow, 18th-level wizard, 2d4 acid damage

for 7 rounds); Search DC 27; Disable Device DC 27.

In the main chamber, Myphosoles keeps a grand sarcopha-

gus as his place of rest. Four everburning candles burn in each

corner of the room, giving rise to ominous shadows across

the  evilly  carved  stone.  When  Myphosoles  is  not  here,  he

keeps a ghoul in the sarcophagus, just as one final deterrence

against would-be tomb-thieves. A search through silks that

cover the sarcophagus interior brings to light 1,000 gp in a

pouch, 2 blue sapphires each worth 1,000 gp, and two flasks

of silversheen.

Ghoul (1): hp 13; see Monster Manual.

THE WARLORDS SUBTERFUGE

This adventure site is suitable for a party of 8th-level adven-

turers.

A  terrible  bandit  warlord  has  increased  his  power  and

mystery  over  time.  Striking  only  by  night,  retreating  to  a

hidden sanctuary, and leaving behind few survivors and no

corpses  of  his  own  forces,  the  Warlords  mystery  deepens,

striking fear into the surrounding lands as his raids grow

ever more bold.

The fact that the Warlords forces are undead is a secret that

the Warlord has hidden so far, and hopes to continue the decep-

tion. Whether successful in this ruse or not, undead forces for

the most part mean that he need not raid merely to pay and

feed sellswords, nor must he worry overmuch for lodging or

amusement for this forces. Because of the hidden entry to his

underground  redoubt,  the  Warlord  has,  so  far,  also  managed

to keep would-be vigilantes from discovering the point from

which he launches his raids.

The best kept secret is the nature of the Warlord himself.

1. Chapel of Solitude (EL 10)

The Chapel of Solitude is an old building constructed two or

three hundred years prior to the present. It has fallen out of men-

tion on clerical rolls of active parishes, yet it remains somewhat

active, with a single active priest providing daily rituals to Pelor

for the infrequent visitor or wayfarer in need of shelter along

the road (the chapel could just as easily be sited in and older

neighborhood of a large city).

The entrance to the Warlords underground refuge is within

a secret passage found in the back of a small chapel, apparently

dedicated  to  Pelor.  A  single  mad  old  clergyperson,  Mother

Shemmel, keeps up the charade. She is adept at keeping secrets

(she actually worships Nerull, not Pelor), and in the pocket of

the Warlord. She allows the forces of the Warlord to exit and

return, cleaning up any tell-tale tracks or other obvious clues

afterward.

She does her best to put off suspicion in the face of ques-

tions, and acts extraordinarily surprised if any evidence of

secret chambers, undead, Nerull worship, or other elements

not  consistent  with  her  supposed  life  as  a  hermetic  priest

serving Pelor is brought to her attention. She tries to keep this

ruse going long enough to warn the Warlord, or if attacked,

defends herself.

A search of the chapel unearths a false  oorboard near the altar

(Search DC 25) with implements of Nerull worship, including a

sickle, a skull cup, and various severed  ngers, and a silver holy

symbol of Nerull. Another search reveals the secret trap door

down to area 2 (Search DC 26).

2. Subterranean Stream

Beneath the chapel a slick stone staircase leads downward some

 fty feet to the banks of a subterranean stream. A small row boat

(enough for 4 medium size creatures to  t) is pulled up along

the narrow bank.

The stream  ows in the direction of the Warlords refuge; it is

only in this section that suf cient space exists above the water

for the boat to travel. The stream is about 10 feet deep.

3. Armory (EL 8)

The stone door to this rough-cut armor is trapped. The trap can

be disengaged from the outside if a secret lever is discovered

ahead of time (Search DC 35).

Deathblade Wall Scythe: CR 8; mechanical; touch trigger;

manual reset; Atk +16 melee (2d4+8 plus poison, scythe); poison

(deathblade, Fortitude DC 20 negates, 1d6 Con/2d6 Con); Search

This chamber holds an assortment of rusted swords, spears,

clubs,  and  other  less-than-quality  weapons  that  the  Warlord

out ts some of his smarter forces with prior to each exodus from

the refuge. In addition to piles of rotting clothes (stripped from

victims) are 23 short swords, 21 long swords, 15 broadswords,

and 4 masterwork longswords.

4. Sunless Isle (EL variable)

This  wide  cavern  conceals  an  island  of  dry  land  on  which

the Warlord has constructed his refugea single-story, win-

dowless stone structure. But of more immediate concern to

visitors are the dark waters surrounding the island. Lying in

quiet rest are the bulk of the warlords forces55 zombies

(human commoner base creature). These zombies do not react

to intruders unless directly commanded by the Warlord or his

Lieutenant (see room 10). However, the Warlord does employ

6 swimming ghasts, feeding them the corpses of the victims

of their raids. The aquatic ghasts attack swimmers and seek to

overturn boats. A favored tactic is to target a weaker swimmer

with 34 ghasts grappling and holding a victim underwater

until the victim drowns. The dark water makes it dif cult to

 nd a drowning victim if held by these devious creatures.

Ghasts, Aquatic (6): hp 29; see Monster Manual.

5. Redoubt

The walls of this windowless stone building are moist with con-

densation, and strong, being some three feet in cross-section.

The main entrance on the south side of the building is a double

door of stone, carved like two halves of a giant skull. The door is

normally locked (Open Lock DC 40), but slits in the eysockets

of the stoneskull allow sickening green light to spill out in faint

wavering bands across the water.

The secret door in the northwestern portion of the building

(Search DC 30) is also locked (Open Lock DC 35).

6. Antechamber (EL 10)

Dozens of candles burning on wall sconces  ll this chamber with

green light and a rancid vapor. Four broad stone pillars appear

to provide support for the ceiling 20 feet above. Each pillar is

sculpted to resemble a single skeletal  nger. A pit between the

pillars  holds  what  appears  to  be  a  half- nished  excavation,

in which the fossilized bones of some prehistoric creature is

revealed. Of course, the Warlord has long ago given necromantic

life to the fossilized bones, which serves as a guardian should

any intruders enter here.

book.

7. Map Room

A wide table covered with the map of the surrounding surface

area, with vulnerable trade routes, cities, and other potential

raiding sites marked in red. The Warlord and the Lieutenant

use this room before embarking on a new raid.

A supply of colored inks and extra quills are located in a small

box under the table.

8. Grisly Studies

The walls of this room are covered in nearly translucent vellum

(human skin stretched and treated). Penned on each sheet are

grisly diagrams of humanoid heads, torsos, arms, and. Hanging

from a chain from the center of the room is the articulated skel-

eton of a griffon. Through its vacant eyesockets, a  ickering bit

of ghoul light burns. On the eastern wall is a modest bookshelf

lined with various tracts on necromancy, including treatises

written by clerics of Nerull and advocates of Doresain.

The Warlord spends time here studying the philosophy of

necromancy.

9. Book of the Warlord (EL 9)

A  chill  pervades  this  chamber,  deeper  than  what  one  might

expect even from the chambers subterranean location. Shadows

linger in the corners like cobwebs, resistant to illumination. In

the center of the room is a stone podium, upon which is a large

tome, The tome is closed, and is titled in Abyssal Book of the

Warlord. In truth, the tome, for all its impressive display, is a

mundane journal, most of the pages un lled. A quantity of inks

and quills can be found in a cubby within the stone podium.

A creature sits in one corner, squatting in the shadowsa

hulking corpse. This creature aids the Warlord if called into

room 10 by the sound of a  ght, or attacks intruders other than

the Lieutenant that enter this chamber.

Hulking Corpse (1): hp 130; see page 109 of this book.

10. Warlords Hall of Introspection (EL 10)

Wide spaces lead to grand thoughts, believes the Warlord, and

so this hall is given over to an arching 30-foot high ceiling and

a  broad  open  space  that  contains  merely  the  wide  throne  of

the Warlord.

Seated upon the throne almost always is a large humanoid

wearing full-plate, complete with helm. Though it seems that

this could be the Warlord, in fact it is a hulking corpse that the

true Warlord attempts to pass off as himself. Indeed, the Warlord

takes the form of an undead brain in a glass jar of preservatives,

which is hidden in a cunningly secret space in the base of the

great stone throne (Search DC 37) with a mere slit allowing the

brain to use its blindsight and telepathy against any creature in

this room.

The Lieutenant also spends much of his time in this chamber,

discussing stratagems with the Warlord. Except in the rarest

of  cases,  only  the  Lieutenant  and  the  faux-Warlord  leave  the

demesne on raids, the Lieutenant apparently taking his cues

from the silent faux-Warlord.

While the Lieutenant knows of the ruse, he plays along. This

ruse is useful in protecting the Warlords true but somewhat

fragile form.

In a  ght, the brain in the jar uses its psionics against would-

be attackers, while the armored hulking corpse moves forward

to physically attack. The Lieutenant also defends the Warlord.

Within 1 round, the hulking corpse in room 9, if still intact,

also joins in the fray.

In  the  event  the  hulking  corpse  falls,  and  the  Lieutenant

is defeated, the brain in the jar, still hidden, ceases its mental

attacks,  hoping  to  retain  its  hidden  location,  then  rebuild

when the aggressors have left, convinced they have defeated

the Warlord.

A secret door in the northwest corner of the room leads to

a secret exit to the exterior of the refuge. A secret door in the

northeast corner of the room holds the Warlords treasury: 1,500

gp, 4 moonstones (50 gp apiece), a hat of disguise and a horn of fog.

Evasion  (Ex):  If the lieutenant  is exposed to any effect

that normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw

for half damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Sneak Attack (Ex): The lieutenant deals an extra 3d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune

to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits  are  all  immune  to  sneak

attacks. The lieutenant may choose to deliver nonlethal damage

with his sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed

for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trap  nding (Ex): The lieutenant can  nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to

 nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magical traps (DC

25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to

bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): The lieutenant retains his Dexterity

bonus to AC even when  at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise

immobile).

Possessions: masterwork studded leather, master work buckler,

masterwork rapier, masterwork shortbow, 20 arrows, gloves of

NECROMANTIC VAULT

This adventure site is suitable for a party of 9th-level adven-

turers.

A powerful city noble, Lady Indrimi, hides a terrible af ic-

tion. Mentally ill, given to supernatural  ts of apathy and sloth,

Indrimi has devised a particularly novel method of shedding

her spiritual af iction, however brie y. By purposefully possess-

ing herself with transitory spirits, she smears some of her own

af iction into the vacuum of undeath. Unfortunately for other

creatures, once she has siphoned off a portion of her apathy into

the possessing spirit, she must shed that spirit into another

living creature to truly be free of the apathy she sought to thrust

upon the spirit.

Here in the Necromantic Vault, found below her mansion

(or  other  appropriate  city  building),  Indrimi  works  her  vile

necromancy.

1. Entrance Shaft (EL 10)

Anyone entering the bottom 20 feet of the shaft that doesnt

bypass the trap with the hidden switch at the top of the shaft

(Search DC 31).

Energy Drain Trap: CR 10; magic device; visual trigger

(true  seeing);  automatic  reset;  Atk  +8  ranged  touch;  spell

effect (energy drain, 17th-level wizard, 2d4 negative levels for

24 hours, Fortitude DC 23 negates); Search DC 34; Disable

Device DC 34.

2. Possession Circle (EL 11)

This large, 30-foot-high circular chamber is  agged completely

in  obsidian.  Fiery  red  stone  picks  out  a  huge  inverted  pen-

tagram on the  ooreven in darkness, the lines constantly

burn  with  green  light.  This  is  Indrimis  Possession  Circle.

As  a  form  of  shock  therapy  to  allay  her  spiritual  taint,  she

allows herself to become possessed by the haunting presence

of undead spirits for a short period, before throwing off their

taint (transferring possession) to some other living sentient

creature (see room 5).

The Possession Circle is always tended by an undead guard-

iana kind of undead called a blaspheme (see page 85). The

blaspheme  here  is  called  Omipethia,  and  as

long  as  it  is  present,  the  Possession  Circle

continues to functionin some fashion,

the  blasphemes  strong  connection  to

the Negative Energy Plane powers the

possession  circle.  Any  creature  entering  is

cordially invited to the center of the pen-

tagramthose who refuse are subject to Omipethias attempt

to grapple and carry the guest into the center of the Possession

Circle.

Possession  Circle:  This  in-place  dungeon  effect  draws  an

unlimited number of undead spirits from the Negative Energy

Plane. This connection is activated when any living creature

(even those already possessed by haunting spirits) steps or is

thrust into the center of the Possession Circle.

A  protection  from  evil  spell  (or  similar  effect)  protects  the

victim.  An  unprotected  target  of  a  possession  attempt  must

succeed  on  a  Will  saving  throw  (DC  18)  to  avoid  possession

each round it remains in the circle; multiple victims inside the

circle can all be simultaneously possessed. Normally, a success-

ful save protects a victim for 24 hours against a particular undead

spirit, but the Possession Circle channels a new undead spirit

each round.

Effects  of  Necromantic  Possession:  Possessed  victim  and

undead spirit are one, and may speak mentally to each other.

Possessing undead spirits have immediate access to all their

victims current thoughts, as the detect thoughts spell, except

that they automatically read surface thoughts.

If desired, a possessing spirit can probe

the  possessed  creatures  memories  as

well, but the victim is allowed a DC

18 Will save. If the save is successful,

the victim keeps the undead spirit out

of his or her thoughts for 24 hours.

Physical harm to the possessed creature does not harm the

possessing spirit. Killing the possessed victim pulls the undead

back across planar boundaries to the Negative Energy Plane.

A  possessing  undead  offers  to  ally  with  the  victim  of  its

possession. But they withhold the bene ts of alliance until the

victim is in a tight spot, then grant alliance. Slowly, as the victim

comes to rely on the undead spirit more and more, the undead

spirit subtlety begins to in uence the behavior of the victim.

Of course, in Lady Indrimis case, possession doesnt usually last

long enough to make a difference (see room 5).

Effects of Necromantic Possession: A possessing undead spirit

rides  along  with  the  victim,  who  may  be  unaware  of  the

undeads presence, initially. The possessing undead can make

its presence known to the victim (although low-Intelligence

victims may not understand what is happening to them). If the

possessed creature is aware of the possessing undead spirit and

willing to be its host, the undead spirit can grant the possessed

creature a +4 profane bonus to any single ability score. This

bonus is granted at the conclusion of some bargaining between

the spirit and the possessed creature. The undead spirit is in

control of this bonus and can take it away as a free action if

the possessed creature takes actions contrary to the undead

spirits wishes. Because the possessor and the possessed can

communicate telepathically, they often form an agreement:

the bonus is a reward for the possessed creature if it does as

the undead spirit wishes.

True Nature of the Undead Spirit: Though immaterial and

without form except for its influence, a possessing undead

spirit is another form of a haunting presence, as described

on page 6.

Omipethia,  Blaspheme  (1):  hp  132;  see  page  85  of  this

book.

3. Room of Sloth

When this room was originally constructed, it was the height of

comfortthe entire  oor was plushly carpeted, soft tapestries

and lights hung in pleasing arrangements, and a magical music

box created pleasing tones. After years of neglect by Indrimi,

who uses this chamber to relax, it is little more than a refuse

pit. She couldnt be bothered to replace the damaged magical

music box, clean the carpet, relight the lights, or expunge the

undead spirit-stink that pervades the areaas an amusement,

Omipethia has recently taken to stacking rotting bodies, the

victims of its nightly hunts, in this chamber.

4. Library of the Necromancer (EL 6)

Indrimi  betrayed  and  killed  her  master  to  which  she  was

apprenticed.  Her  old  master,  the  Ancient,  was  a  renowned

necromancer,  and  responsible  for  the  current  Necromantic

Vault and Possession CircleIndrimi never studied enough

to become nearly so pro cient. This was the Ancients library,

and it is  lled with wide, dusty leather tomes of undead lore and

practice. However, Omipethia, in the face of Indrimis obvious

apathy, has done a good job of eradicating most of the texts of

any real power, save one he missed.

A false bookshelf (treat as a secret door; Search DC 31; locked;

Open Lock DC 40) is trapped. If the trap and door are overcome,

the Book of Deathless Spells is revealed. This item is a spellbook

containing three spells of each level from 1st to 5th (chosen

from among the spells in this book).

Whirling Poison Blades: CR 6; mechanical; timed trigger;

automatic reset; hidden lock bypass (Search DC 25, Open Lock

DC 30); Atk +10 melee (1d4+4/1920 plus poison, dagger); poison

(purple worm poison, Fortitude DC 24 negates, 1d6 Str/1d6 Str);

multiple  targets  (one  target  in  each  of  three  preselected  5-ft.

squares); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20.

5. Transference (EL variable)

This chamber is where Lady Indrimi spends much of her time.

A chipped stone seat, containing limp, stained pillows serves

as her throne. At either arm, pentagrams are inscribed in the

 oor with inlaid red stone that constantly burns with  endish

lambency. Here, Lady Indrimi sheds possessing undead spirits

into fresh living vessels. When she purposely possesses herself,

some portion of her spiritual af iction of sloth is passed to the

possessing spirit. When she sheds the haunting presence, that

trait is passed to whatever victim is newly possessed, leaving her

a few days (or hours) of clear-headedness before the supernatural

urge of her tainted mind once again drags her down into sloth.

Haunting presences initially possessing Indrimi are happy to

obligethey think nothing of taking on spiritual af ictions,

and enjoy the idea of passing on that af iction, undead vectors

of a spiritual plague.

Transference Circles: The stone seat acts as a psychic drain for

any creature sitting upon it that is possessed by a sentience not

its own. Should any creature enter the pentagram to the left of

the throne while a possessed creature sits upon the throne, that

sentience is automatically passed from the possessed creature on

the throne and into the individual on the pentagram, along with

wracking pain that leaves the newly possessed victim stunned

for 1 round, then shaken for 3 additional rounds. Unlike its

helpful  attitude  when  possessing  a  victim  in  room  2,  a

transferred possessing spirit attempts to control its new host

(attempt to control as akin to dominate person cast at the 14th

level of ability 3/day, or simply hinder the victims actions by

granting the victim a 4 profane penalty to any single ability

score).  If  the  undead  spirit  leaves  its  host  or  is  expelled  by

someone casting a dispel evil spell, it is drawn back to Negative

Material plane.

The other pentagram, to the thrones right, acts as a random

teleporter with a 2,000 mile range. It is Indrimis practice to

send all newly shed undead spirits, with their host, through it in

order to be rid of them and eliminate the chance of the undead

spirit causing problems locally.

Lady Indrimi: Unwashed, and gaunt, Lady Indrimis is most

commonly found slouched on some couch or other seat, gazing

without purpose or will into the distance. She lightly hums a

tune that never changes or varies through the years, since she

cant  be  troubled  to  learn  a  new  one.  Her  spiritual  af iction

reduces her to this, and so her life has become a revolving tor-

ture of attempting to compensate for the presence of her mental

de ciency. Her possession therapy is somewhat effective, and

so she undergoes possession and undead spirit shedding imme-

diately prior to important meetings with others of the city in

which she is an of cial and for other special circumstances. The

problem is, she never knows when the ef uvia of spiritual indif-

ference will build to the point where it will again overwhelm

her. Whenever one Lord says to another, Who cares? they refer

to Lady Indrimibut never in her presence.

Indrimis  Goals:  Lady  Indrimis  personal  overarching  goal

varies, depending on whether she is in an upswing or down-

swing. When free of apathy, she seeks to further her knowledge

of necromancy, so as to more ably control her downswing. When

fully in the grip of her sloth, she actually would fully welcome

death, but cant trouble herself to deal it herself. When on an

upswing (post-transference), she considers the idea of lichdom,

thinking that such tribulations of spirit would be left behind

forever without the swell of blood in their veins and emotions

in their heart.

CATACOMB OF THE SCION

This adventure site is suitable for a party of 13th- level adven-

turers.

A  catacomb  is  an  underground  cemetery  consisting  of

passages  and  tunnels  with  rooms  and  recesses  leading  off

them  for  burial  chambers.  Catacombs  can  be  found  under

old churches, under castles, and other places where the dead

are revered.

Unfortunately, catacombs have an unfortunate tendency to

serve as breeding grounds for undead activity. This has become

especially true for the catacomb that has come to be called the

Catacomb of the Scion. It might be found under old ruins, or

possibly even under an active monastery (but one where the

priests seldom venture below the basement levels and on into

the catacomb).

6. The Ancients Laboratory

1. Alcoves

What was once a state of the art necromancers laboratory is

now reduced a ruin of broken glass, corroded stone, and twisted

metal. Tiny sparks still buzz from ruined wizardly equipment,

but at  rst glance, nothing seems salvageable. This ruin occurred

during one of Indrimis downswings; shes her own worst enemy

in her quest to gain understanding of the world of undeath.

7. The Ancients Vault (EL 8)

Not everything is lost. The Ancient kept a vault of special items

useful  in  his  research,  behind  a  secret  door  (Search  DC  30),

though unmindful access of the secret vault sets off the trap.

Destruction Trap: CR 8; magic device; touch trigger (alarm);

automatic reset; spell effect (destruction, 13th-level cleric, Forti-

tude DC 20 to take 10d6 damage); Search DC 32; Disable Device

DC 32.

A locked (Open Lock DC 30) iron chest holds a few oddments

that remain useful: candle of invocation, a chime of interruption,

the Ancients Spellbook (which contains a wealth of spells not

already found in the Book of Deathless Spells), and a decanter

of endless water.

Spellbook (The Ancients Spellbook): 0arcane mark, dancing

lights,  daze,  detect  magic,  disrupt  undead,   are,  light,  mage  hand,

In this simplest form, the catacomb consist of several under-

ground tunnels and rooms in a rectangular or grid plan. The

hollows cut in these recessed walls received bodies on a regular

basis when the catacomb was being actively  lled. The alcoves

lining these sorts of hallways contain a jumble of disintegrating

bones and mummi ed remains, the remains of several  gures

commonly  mixed.  The  remains  are  barely  distinguishable

through the gauzy barrier of the cobwebs and dust.

2. Complex Alcoves (EL 11)

The areas keyed to this entry have deeper hollows cut into the

surrounding stone. Furthermore, the stonework is actually relief

carved to some extent with simple decorations and symbols of

the faith. Because of the scions presence in the catacomb, some

of the dead haunt these alcoves as dread wraiths.

Dread Wraiths (1): hp 104; see Monster Manual.

3. Altars of the Dead

Several sarcophagi are found in the chambers keyed to this entry.

By virtue of being big and solid, these sarcophagi once served

as altars during ceremonies to honor the dead, although that

practice has ceased since the catacomb fell into disuse.

The sections of the catacombs keyed to this entry each contain

2 sarcophagi, but no names or other identifying material remain

on the exterior. Each sarcophagi contains the dust of rotted

clothing and bones, but also 2d20 gp of ancient vintage.

4. Secret Vault (EL 10)

If the secret door is found and opened, a vault contain-

ing  a  rusted  chest  is  revealed.  The  room  is  trapped

with a deadly wail.

Wail of the Banshee Trap: CR 10; magic device;

proximity trigger (alarm); automatic reset; spell effect

(wail of the banshee, 17th-level wizard, Fortitude DC 23

negates); multiple targets (up to seventeen creatures);

Search DC 34; Disable Device DC 34.

The rusted chest is locked (Open Lock DC 40) and

holds 4,319 gp of ancient coinage, a scroll of hide from

undead, and an ancient document. The document con-

tains only a few words that are still decipherable: ...if the

Scion is called, then the catacomb must be abandoned.

Nothing can stand before the Scion....

5. Mummies

A highly carved sarcophagus lie in both the rooms keyed to this

entry. A brass plaque on the side of each sarcophagus  contains

the name of some long dead occupant. Each sarcophagi con-

tains the dust of rotted clothing and bones, but also 2d20 gp

of ancient vintage.

6. Exhalation of the Scion

Large iron doors separate the less active portions of the cata-

combs from the more active. The iron doors are composed of two

valves. A large lock remains an integral part of the door (Open

Lock DC 40); however, the key to the lock hangs on a brass hook

on the north wall. A brass plaque above the key reads: Beyond

these valves lies deaths scion.

If the key is used and the doors are pulled open, the hallway

beyond is revealed. At the same time, a plume of ground hug-

ging mist pours past the doors and begins to spread into the

uncompromised  portion  of  the  catacombs.  This  is  referred

to as the exhalation, and it  lls the remaining portion of the

catacomb. It is a side effect of the creature that has taken up

residence in room 13.

7. Weeping Dead (EL 12)

This passage contains an inch thick swirl of the misty Exhala-

tion.  The  air  is  subtly  colder  where  the  mist  interfaces  with

clear air.

Besides the Exhalation, the passage looks super cially like

the areas keyed to room 3, and have the same chances to contain

valuables. However, two wheeps walk this hall. Though initially

quiet,  the  creatures  rouse  and  begin  their  mournful  cries  if

any of the sarcophagi here are searched, or 1d4 rounds after a

living being walks through the passage (someone who enters

the catacomb too fast and too deeply could turn around to  nd

a phalanx of undead to the rear, cutting off easy escape).

No matter how many times the wheeps are destroyed, after the

passage of 24 hours, the wheeps return while the atropal scion

remains ensconced in room 12.

Wheeps (2): hp 52; see page 132 of this book.

8. Drowned One (EL 9)

This  room,  beneath  its  layer  of  Exhalation  mist,  is  a   oor

under four feet of water. A waterlogged undead corpse lies

here, eager to bring the living into its watery grave. Any

who enter (or who stand in the doorway) are attacked. A

search of the pool  oor reveals 2,104 gp, 5 amethysts (50

gp), and a metamagic rod of lesser enlarge.

Hulking corpse: hp 150; see page 109 of this book.

9. Dead Walking (EL 12)

This passage contains an inch thick swirl of the misty

Exhalation. The air is subtly colder where the mist inter-

faces with clear air.

Besides  the  Exhalation,  the  passage  looks  super -

cially like the areas keyed to room 1, and have the same

chances to contain valuables (that is, no chance). How-

ever, 4 mohrgs wander this passage. Though initially

quiet, the creatures rouse if any of the niches here

are searched, or 1d4 rounds after a living being walks

through the passage.

No matter how many times the mohrgs are destroyed, after

the passage of 24 hours, the mohrgs return while the atropal

scion remains ensconced in room 12.

10. White Kingdom Ghouls (EL 12)

The six areas keyed to this entry and the hallway that connects

them  are   lled  with  an  shin-deep  layer  of  the  misty  Exhala-

tion. The air is de nitely colder where the mist interfaces with

clear air.

Each of the rooms keyed to this entry are covered in soft

earth, though this may not be immediately apparent because

of the obscuring mist. Three ghouls  ghters are buried in an

earthy embrace in each room. The necrotic leakage from the

nearby atropal scion nourishes the ghouls; however, they do

not pass up the opportunity for fresh meat. 1d4 rounds after a

room is entered, or 1d4 rounds after a room is bypassed, two

of the ghouls dig their way to the surface and attack, though

one remains below. The ghouls attack by clawing with their

 lthy nails and biting with their fangs, grunting in an an-

cient  tongue  (if  the  player  characters  have  a  pro ciency  in

ancient  language  or  magical  interpretation  available,  the

ghouls seem to be repeating the phrase, To the White King-

dom with you!).

If any character becomes paralyzed by the ghouls super-

natural touch, the remaining ghoul in the earth attempts to

draw the victim below as a tasty snack. Friends of the victim

can grab hold of a sinking companion and delay the victim

from being drawn below the earth while a grip is maintained if

they successfully oppose a grapple check of the pulling ghoul.

If unopposed by compatriots above, a character is drawn com-

pletely below the soil over the course of 1 full round. Though

these ghouls apparently have the ability to move through the

soil  as  if  it  were  water,  the  heroes  must  dig.  Unfortunately,

a  ghoul  below  the  earth  begins  feasting  immediately,  and

unless characters have a shovel, its unlikely theyll dig down

the six feet necessary to reach the level of their companion in

the time it takes for a paralyzed character to become just so

much cooling food (1d4+1 rounds to dig down, but only 1d4

rounds to be eaten).

12. Embalmed (EL 14)

The  six  areas  keyed  to  this  entry  contains  a  shin-high

layer of bone-cold mist.

Besides being misty, these areas look super cially like room

3, and have the same chances to contain valuables. ). However, 4

mohrgs wander this passage. Though initially quiet, the creatures

rouse if any of the niches here are searched, or 1d4 rounds after

a living being walks through the passage.

No matter how many times the mohrgs are destroyed, after

the passage of 24 hours, the mohrgs return while the atropal

scion remains ensconced in room 12.

Mummy Lords (4): hp 97; see Monster Manual.

13. Scion of Death (EL 15)

The  Exhalation  has  its  source  in  this  room:  A  sarcophagus

much like any other in the catacombs lies in the center of the

chamber, its top open, the mist pouring out of it. However, this

holds a normally inactive atropal scion. The necrotic radiation

of its body is enough to keep the rest of the catacomb supplied

with unlife. If any living creatures comes to within 10 feet of

its resting place (and its negative energy aura), it rises above the

lip and attacks.

The atropal scion itself doesnt know from whence it came.

But, its sarcophagus contains an inscription in stone: Ceno-

pulchre. The atropal scion bene ts from the unhallow effect

emanating from the darkskull within its sarcophagus.

Searching  the  sarcophagus  reveals  32  bloodstone  gems

(100 gp apiece) and a darkskull.

Libris Mortis is all about undeadtheir abilities, how to

fight them, how to improve them, and how best to use

them in your campaign. This short scenario uses feats,

spells, and monsters from that book to build campaign

elements that involve undead.

Taruss  Banquet is  a  short  D&D  adventure  for  four

10th-level player characters (PCs). It takes place in and

around a manor house near a small city. As always, feel

free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit

to make it work with your campaign.

PREPARATION

You  (the  DM)  need  the  D&D  core  rulebooksthe

Players Handbook, the Dungeon Masters Guide, and the

Monster  Manualas  well  as  Libris  Mortis to  run  this

adventure. This scenario utilizes the D&D v.3.5 rules.

To get started, print out the adventure, including the

map. Read through the scenario at least once to famil-

iarize  yourself  with  the  situation,  threats,  and  major

NPCs (particularly their motivations). Then review the

information  on  the  psychic  vampire  in  Libris  Mortis.

Text that appears in shaded boxes is player information

that you can read aloud or paraphrase for the players at

the  proper  times.  Monster  and  NPC  statistics  are

provided with each encounter in abbreviated form or,

where  appropriate,  the  proper  page  in  the  Monster

Manual or Libris Mortis is referenced.

ADVENTURE

BACKGROUND

The  story  behind  this  adventure  begins  some  twenty

years  ago,  with  a  noble  family  based  in  a  somewhat

remote location.

LOPHAR

Lophar, a wealthy aristocrat, was always the black sheep

of his family. He frequently hired teams of experts and

bodyguards  to  accompany  him  on  explorations  of

strange ruins in hopes of uncovering forgotten secrets.

On  one  such  trip,  he  died  at  the  hands  of  a  psychic

vampire (see the Vampire Variants section of the New

Monsters  chapter  in  Libris  Mortis)  and  subsequently

rose  as  a  vampire  of  the  same  kind  under  his  slayers

control. Shortly thereafter, a band of adventurers killed

his master, and he found himself free and blessed with

the powers of undeath.

Lophar remained in hiding for nearly a year, return-

ing  to  his  family  only  after  devising  an  airtight  story

about his deeds in a foreign land. Ambitious but subtle,

he looked within his family for others who might make

1

good  vampire  underlings,  but  most  of  them  disap-

pointed him with their physical weaknesses, petty bick-

ering,  or  flamboyant  personal  habits.  Eventually,  he

decided that grooming a youngster to serve him from

birth  would  be  much  more  effective  than  shopping

among his adult family members.

Thus, when his sisters son Tarus was born, Lophar

took  a  special  interest  in  the  boy.  Over  the  years,

Lophar trained Tarus as his protg, his agent, and even-

tually  his  lieutenant.  Lophar  made  Tarus  a  vampire

about a year ago, and he has not yet needed to use his

supernatural influence to control his nephew.

TARUS

Tarus Bargden is a charismatic young aristocrat with a

minor talent for sorcery. Raised in the lap of luxury under

the  watchful  eye  of  Lophar,  he  willingly  entered  his

uncles service and readily embraced the vampiric state

when  Lophar  offered  it.  Though  the  young  psychic

vampire  is  technically  under  the  control  of  his  uncle

Lophar, he willingly obeys the older vampires commands,

so his uncle has never needed to exercise the magical

control  he  holds  over  Tarus.  Arrogant  but  diplomatic,

skilled in arms but proficient in magic, Tarus embodies

the  ideal  qualities  of  a  tyrant  noble,  and  his  vampiric

powers serve to back up his decrees quite effectively.

THE PLOT

Whether  or  not  they  intended  to  do  so,  the  PCs  took

some  action  that  thwarted  one  of  Lophars  plans  in

recent  months.  Though  the  characters  may  not  even

know about Lophars existence, the incident has made

the vampire aware of them, and he has decided to deal

with  them  now  because  theyll  only  become  tougher

and more difficult to kill later on. To that end, Lophar

has sent Tarus to put an end to the PCs.

On instructions from his uncle, Tarus bought a piece

of  property  near  the  characters  home  base  and  spent

several  months  establishing  a  reputation  among  the

locals as a wealthy nobleman fond of hunting and high-

society parties. Though Tarus was already well aware of

the  PCs  identities  and  exploits,  he  allowed  a  suitable

amount of time to pass before approaching them, so as

to prevent questions about how he learned of their exis-

tence so fast. He now intends to invite the PCs to his

home  on  some  pretext  and  slay  them  there.  But  he

recognizes  the  danger  inherent  in  the  mission,  and

though he is loyal to his uncle, Tarus still values his own

unlife.  Realizing  this  fact,  his  uncle  has  given  him

permission to flee if completing this task would mean

his destruction.

ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS

Tarus  begins  by  issuing  the  PCs  an  invitation  to  his

mansion for a banquet and a night hunt beneath the full

moon. During the hunt, he and his minions turn on the

characters, intending to kill them and explain it away as

a terrible hunting accident or monster attack. The PCs

must  avoid  death  at  the  hands  of  the  vampire  and  his

minions and, ideally, destroy them all.

BEGINNING THE

ADVENTURE

Taruss Banquet is an encounter-based scenario in which

the action occurs in and around the mansion that Tarus

Bargden  has  purchased.  The  adventure  begins  when

the  characters  receive  an  invitation  to  a  fete  at  the

mansion (see encounter A, below).

A. THE INVITATION

A  courier  wearing  the  livery  of  the  Bargden  family

delivers a message to the PCs when they are at home or

at  one  of  their  favorite  haunts.  If  the  characters  live

secretly or avoid frequenting any particular restaurant

or bar, the message goes to a public organizationsuch

as a temple, wizard guild, or fighting schoolto which

one or more of the PCs belongs.

The message consists of a folded piece of parchment

secured  with  wax  and  stamped  with  the  seal  of  the

Bargden family (a boars head surrounded by six stars).

It is addressed to one or more of the PCs by name, and

the name of the organization to which it was mailed is

also noted, if appropriate.

The letter reads as follows. Modify the text below as

needed, inserting exact dates for the dinner and adding

noble  titles  for  the  PCs  (if  appropriate)  and  a  city  of

origin for Tarus.

My Esteemed Adventurers,

Tales  of  your  accomplishments  have  reached  my

ears and elicited a spark of interest within me. It

has become my habit to invite persons of interest

to  my  home  for  dinner,  and  while  I  normally

extend  such  invitations  only  to  the  nobility,  I

believe  your  deeds  merit  an  exception.  If  I  am

convinced

that  your  reputations  are  not

unfounded, I may have information of interest to

you, and perhaps even a business opportunity.

2

Your attendance is requested at my mansion at

sundown  on  the  eve  of  the  next  full  moon.

Activities include dinner prepared by my servants

and  a  moonlight  hunt  of  whatever  fast  natural

creature  we  can  find  near  the  grounds.  Daylight

hunts are far too easy for a man of my skill, and I

presume that the same holds true for you. Please

respond  by  the  day  after  tomorrow  by  courier,

letter, or in person.

With gracious intent,

Lord Tarus Bargden

A party, the opportunity to make contact with a noble,

the possibility of valuable information, and a chance to

do business ought to be enough to convince the PCs to

attend. If they are still reluctant, or if you dont feel that

the above message will catch their interest, modify the

invitation so that it makes specific references to people,

places, events, or items that directly concern them.

If the PCs respond by letter or courier, they receive

a pleasant acknowledgement of their RSVP from Lord

Tarus  and  a  reminder  of  the  dinner  the  morning

before  it  occurs.  If  they  respond  in  person,  they  are

met by Lennel, Lord Tarus manservant (see area B1a,

below),  who  accepts  their  response  on  behalf  of  his

lord and offers regrets that his master is away on busi-

ness that day. Lennel politely thanks the PCs for their

time and tells them he looks forward to seeing them at

the lords banquet.

No other events relating to this scenario occur until

the  night  of  the  banquet.  Go  to  encounter  B,  below,

when the PCs approach the manor.

B. THE GROUNDS

Lord  Bargdens  mansion  stands  atop  a  hill  in  a  lightly

wooded  area  about  a  mile  down  a  private  side  road.  A

broad, well-maintained path climbs the wooded hill to

the house.

B1. HOUSE EXTERIOR

The mansion was meticulously maintained by its previ-

ous  owner,  and  Tarus  has  ensured  that  it  remained  in

good  repair  during  his  tenancy.  This  encounter

describes the grounds around the manor and the events

that occur there prior to the banquet.

B1a. Entry Path (EL 3)

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs reach

point A on the map of the house and grounds.

Atop a hill in a lightly wooded area stands a two-

story building with a large chimney at the side and

a double-door entrance in the front. A path leads

to  the  left  around  the  house,  presumably  to  a

stable.  In  a  clear  area  to  the  right  stands  a  long

wooden table with eight chairs (one slightly larger

than the others). Several servants are busy setting

dishes, glasses, and silverware at each place. Four

vertical  wooden  poles  surround  the  table,  each

holding  an  unlit  lantern  about  7  feet  off  the

ground. A thin man with iron-gray hair stands on

the paving stones just outside the front door of the

manor, directing the servants as they go in and out

of the house. The scent of cooking food floats from

the manor whenever the door opens.

The servants are busy setting up for the evenings festiv-

ities.

Creatures: The  servants  are  normal  humans.

Tarus  doesnt  keep  them  dominated  all  the  time

because  he  wants  them  to  be  able  to  go  about  their

duties in a normal fashion. He isnt shy about using his

dominate  ability  to  browbeat  them  into  submission  if

they become insolent or rebellious, however.

The gray-haired man is Lennel, Taruss manservant.

A sergeant in the army in his younger days, Lennel is

polite to guests but a terror to the servants. Like the rest

of the staff, he has been subjected to Taruss dominate

ability  in  the  past,  so  he  obeys  his  master  unfailingly,

knowing that his life is the price of erring too greatly.

Fortunately, Lennel is as good at taking orders as giving

them,  and  since  he  served  as  one  of  Lophars  private

bodyguards  for  several  years  (both  before  and  after

Lophar became a vampire), he knows how to deal with

the  Bargden  family.  Lennel  can  feel  himself  growing

older  now,  and  he  hopes  that  his  master  will  either

make  him  a  vampire  or  put  him  out  of  his  misery

quickly rather leaving him a weak old man.

D Lennel: NE  male  human  warrior  4;  hp  18.

Lennel  is  unremarkable  except  that  he  has  the  Tomb-

Tainted  Soul  feat  (see  the  Prestige  Classes  chapter  in

Libris Mortis), plus a few ranks in Diplomacy.

D Servants (10): Male and female commoner 1;

hp 4.

Tactics: When the PCs arrive, Lennel greets them

cordially. If they rode to the manor, he whistles for the

groundskeeper  to  take  their  mounts  to  the  stable  for

grooming  and  feeding.  Lennel  explains  that  Lord

Bargden is out surveying the grounds for a good place

to  start  tonights  hunt  and  will  be  back  shortly.  Until

then, he suggests that the PCs go to the party grounds

3

(area B1b), have a look around, and choose their seats.

The  only  restriction  on  their  choices  is  that  the  large

seat at the head of the table is Lord Bargdens.

Lennel knows that his role in Taruss plan is to keep

the  household  running,  not  to  fight.  Thus,  he  tries  to

escape if combat breaks out, and he surrenders imme-

diately if cornered.

B1b. Party Grounds (EL 3)

Read or paraphrase the following aloud when the PCs

reach the area marked B on the map of the house and

grounds.

The table in this area is set for eight guests. Each

place setting features three different plates and a

dizzying  selection  of  forks  and  spoons.  The

lantern-poles  should  be  more  than  sufficient  to

light  this  entire  area  during  the  meal.  The  hill

slopes down to the south and provides a nice view

of the hillside and the nearby land.

When dusk begins to gather, Lennel orders one of the

servants to light the lanterns around the table.

Creatures: See area B1a, above.

Development: If  the  PCs  group  has  fewer  than

seven members and they ask Lennel about the remain-

ing  seats,  he  explains  that  Lord  Bargden  invited  some

other  adventurers  to  attend  this  evening  and  names  a

few other well-known individuals of the same or lower

level than the PCs. He goes on to explain that the other

guests had to cancel at the last minute because of some

monster hunt.

B1c. Path to Other Buildings (EL 6)

This  area  is  the  northwestern  edge  of  the  hill  upon

which  the  mansion  is  built.  Read  or  paraphrase  the

following aloud when the PCs reach the area marked C

on the map of the house and grounds.

At the northwestern edge of the hill is well-trod-

den path leading down to the east. About halfway

down the hill the path branches into three parts.

One branch ends a clearing in front of a building

that  looks  like  a  stable  and  a  small  house

constructed  of  wood  and  stone.  Another  branch

leads  west  to  the  front  of  the  manor,  and  a  third

leads  south  to  a  small  door  in  the  garden  wall

behind the mansion.

The  small  building  is  the  groundskeepers  home.  The

stable also includes a kennel where Tarus keeps his dogs.

Creatures: In  addition  to  looking  after  the  trees

and  animals,  the  groundskeeper  tends  the  garden,

entering  and  exiting  through  the  small  door  in  the

garden wall. The garden path leads to the exterior doors

on the ground floor (see area C9).

The  three  hunting  dogs  kenneled  in  the  stable  are

actually natural werewolves in their animal forms. Via

his dominate ability, Tarus forces them to live in wolf

form and serve as his hunting dogs. The creatures actu-

ally look more like wolves than dogs, and if confronted

with that fact, Tarus claims that they are half-breeds and

are probably more wolf than dog. He says he obtained

them through a friend who knew a breeder and doesnt

know their actual pedigrees. See the Detect Evil sidebar

if the PCs use detect evil on the dogs.

Unlike the servants, the dogs are under the influ-

ence of Taruss dominate ability at all times, and anyone

observing them for 1 minute can make a DC 15 Sense

Motive check to notice that theyre not behaving quite

like normal dogsor even wolves. If the PCs ask about

the  dogs,  Tarus  explains  their  behavior  as  normal

excitement prior to the coming hunt.

B2. THE LORD ARRIVES (EL 10)

Read or paraphrase the following when the last light is

fading from the sky.

Moments before sundown, a tall man approaches

from the southwest. He is dressed in a fashionable

nobles outfit, though his boots are dirty. His body

is tall, lean, and strong, and he has fair skin, dark

hair, and clear blue eyes.

The  newcomer  is  Tarus,  and  his  entrance  is  a  staged

event  calculated  to  convince  any  unduly  suspicious

guests that he couldnt possibly be a vampire, since he

appeared  while  the  sun  was  still  in  the  sky.  Shortly

before sundown, Tarus left the house in gaseous form,

floated  secretly  into  the  trees  to  the  south  of  the

mansion, then assumed human form and walked toward

the party grounds. He timed his entrance so that his

Endure Sunlight feat could keep him comfortable for the

10 seconds or so he would have to spend in the sunlight.

Tarus  greets  his  guests  pleasantly,  though  his

manner  is  somewhat  aloof,  like  that  of  most  other

nobles.

Creatures: Tarus looks only slightly paler than he

did when he was alive. Should anyone ask, he explains

4

the change in his complexion as the result of a severe

illness from which he has now fully recovered.

D Tarus  Bargden: hp  60;  see  Appendix  for

statistics.

C. THE BANQUET (EL 11)

Read or paraphrase the following when you  decide  to

start the dinner.

As  darkness  gathers,  Tarus  gestures  for  everyone

to  join  him  at  the  table.  The  night  breezes  are

warm, and the glow of the torches provides a cozy

atmosphere.

As  soon  as  everyone  is  seated,  Tarus  signals  for  the

servants to bring the drinks and the first course.

The five-course meal is not poisoned, and in fact the

victuals are of exceptionally high quality. Tarus knows

that  poison  in  the  food  might  be  detected,  and  worse

still, it might have no effect at all on some of the char-

acters. However, any character who deliberately stuffs

himself  or  drinks  too  much  takes  a  2  circumstance

penalty  on  attacks,  saves,  and  checks  for  the  next  two

hours.  This  penalty  increases  to  4  if  the  character

overindulged in both food and drink.

Creatures: In  addition  to  Tarus,  Lennel,  and  the

other  servants,  two  of  Taruss  controlled  vampires

(Praslin  and  Kantos)  make  periodic  appearances

throughout the meal.

D Tarus  Bargden: hp  60;  see  Appendix  for

statistics.

D Praslin: hp 42; see Appendix for statistics.

D Kantos: hp 39; see Appendix for statistics.

D Lennel: hp 18; see encounter B1a.

Tactics: During  the  meal,  Tarus  urges  the  PCs  to

eat  and  drink  to  their  hearts  content,  knowing  that

their  overindulgence  now  will  make  it  easier  to  hunt

them down later. He talks of the invigorating night air,

his  love  of  fine  food  and  hunting,  and  his  plans  to

acquire  more  property  in  the  area  from  some  of  the

weaker or poorer nobles.

Tarus also encourages the adventurers to talk about

their  past  adventures.  He  prompts  them  for  details  of

their  best-known  exploits  by  making  comments  such

as, I want to hear it from the horses mouth, as they say,

without the commoners getting all the details wrong.

If necessary, he relates some of his uncles adventuring

stories,  pretending  theyre  his  own,  to  get  the  PCs  to

open  up.  He  listens  carefully  to  their  tales,  hoping  to

gain a better understanding of their abilities, the kinds

of creatures theyve fought, and any weaknesses in their

personal or group strategies. If he feels that they are too

powerful for him to kill tonight with the creatures he

has at his disposal, he postpones his murderous plans to

a  later  date,  though  he  still  holds  the  promised  hunt

tonight to avoid making them suspicious. Reasons for

Tarus to delay the attack may include a history of excel-

lent tactics, two or more strong cleric or paladin PCs, a

history of fighting undead (particularly vampires) with

great success, or the presence of magic items that have

a good chance of harming Tarus, such as undead-bane

weapons or a wand of searing light.

pqqqqrs

DETECT EVIL

Tarus  and  his  servitor  vampires,  Praslin,  and

Kantos,  are  evil  and  can  be  revealed  as  such  by

detect  evil and  similar  effects.  But  an  evil  nature  is

not  considered  sufficient  provocation  for  murder,

and  the  PCs  dont  have  the  legal  right  to  attack

people just because they detect as evil. In fact, doing

so  is  often  a  good  way  to  land  in  prison.  Taruss

status  as  a  noble  makes  this  situation  particularly

difficult, since an unprovoked attack on a member

of the nobility is considered a capital crime in most

lands.  Players  who  get  itchy  to  attack  should  be

warned  about  the  illegality  of  their  actions,  and

perhaps  of  the  limitations  of  the  spell  as  well

Tarus  could  well  detect  as  evil  because  he  has  evil

thoughts,  even  if  he  has  never  committed  an  evil

deed.  Given  the  fact  that  hes  a  vampire,  however,

Tarus  radiates  moderate  evil  rather  than  the  faint

evil  that  a  living  human  of  equivalent  level  would.

This fact should alert the PCs that Tarus is not quite

what he appears.

Because  Taruss  dogs  are  actually  chaotic  evil

werewolves, they also detect as evil, and that fact is

harder to explain. If confronted with the truth about

his animals, Tarus feigns ignorance about the cause

of their evil auras. (That would explain why theyve

been  acting  strangely,  he  says,  as  if  with  dawning

understanding.) He promises to get one of the local

temples  to  investigate  the  matter  as  soon  as

possible.  Tarus  is  an  experienced  aristocrat  and  a

vampire  to  boot,  so  he  has  an  extra  edge  when  it

comes to telling a convincing story via the Bluff skill.

pqqqqrs

5

During the dinner, Praslin and Kantos come out of

the  mansion  to  speak  with  Tarus  periodically.  Tarus

apologizes for the interruptions, explaining that as his

familys representative in this area, he sometimes has to

deal with family business at inopportune times. These

quick visits give him a chance to pass messages to his

servitor  vampires  and  let  them  examine  the  evenings

prey. At no time does he refer to his uncle Lophar; he

simply mentions his family or his father.

Development: If  Tarus  decides  to  delay  killing

the PCs, he tries his best to befriend them during the

rest of the evening so that he has an excuse to contact

them again at a later date, when he is more prepared to

kill them. He uses the intervening time until their next

visit to create more vampire spawn, which he hides in

the woods until he can unleash them on the PCs as part

of his overall plan of attack.

D. THE MANSION

When the banquet is over, Tarus invites the PCs into the

mansion for one last drink by the fire to help their meal

settle before the hunt. A complete key to the mansion is

given in encounter F, below. Read or paraphrase the

following when he takes them into the house.

Tarus  walks  through  the  front  door  into  what

appears  to  be  a  sumptuously  appointed  living

room. A great stone fireplace occupies most of this

chambers east wall. The fire has burned down low

and is now little more than coals. Against the walls

stand eight wooden chairs, and four large, decora-

tive  urns  mark  the  corners  of  the  chamber.  Two

sets of double doors open into the roomone on

the north wall, and one on the south. Tarus casu-

ally  points  out  the  sitting  room  and  the  dining

room beyond, then makes a grand gesture encom-

passing the rest of the house.

Welcome to my humble home. Do make your-

selves comfortable, Tarus says easily, taking a seat

by the fireplace. I regret that I cannot show you

the  rest  of  the  house  at  this  time,  but  frankly,  I

have  been  so  busy  doing  my  fathers  work  that  I

havent  had  time  to  unpack  all  of  my  reference

books and other belongings. Worse still, some of

the trophies from my hunts are still waiting at the

tanners  because  I  havent  had  time  to  arrange

delivery, let alone find places to hang them.

Development: If Tarus feels that the PCs trust him

or have at least taken a liking to him, he promises them

a tour of the entire mansion on their next visit. By that

6

time, hopefully, he will have everything unpacked.

D1. DEATH IN THE MANSION (EL 13)

If  Tarus  feels  that  at  least  two  of  the  PCs  have

overindulged  in  food  or  drink,  and  he  still  plans  to

murder them tonight, he must decide whether to attack

them  here  in  the  mansion  or  wait  for  the  hunt.  If  he

decides  to  make  his  move  here,  he  gives  Lennel  a

prearranged signal to bring them poisoned drinks. His

toxin of choice is striped toadstool poison (see page 297

in  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide),  and  Lennel  has  been

instructed  to  use  a  double  dose  (two  initial  and  two

secondary saving throws) in each glass because the PCs

are extraordinary individuals.

Creatures: If  Tarus  attacks  the  PCs  here,  Praslin

and Kantos rush to help, and all three call for the skulk-

ing cysts in the corner urns to break free and attack (see

area F2). Meanwhile, Lennel and the other servants flee

to  their  quarters  since,  as  living  creatures,  they  are

vulnerable to the vampires Wisdom-draining auras).

statistics.

D Kantos: hp 39; see Appendix for statistics.

D Lennel: hp 18; see encounter B1a.

D Skulking Cysts (4): hp 26; see Libris Mortis.

Tactics: Not  only  is  Tarus  smart,  but  he  was  also

trained and educated by an experienced adventurer

namely Lophar. If Tarus has a minute to himself before

starting  this  fight,  he  casts  mage  armor and expeditious

retreat on  himself.  He  stays  close  to  his  opponents  so

that  they  cant  use  fireball or  other  area  spells  on  him,

and  he  does  his  best  to  guard  against  invisible  foes.

Otherwise,  he  tailors  his  tactics  to  what  he  learned

about the PCs during dinner. Praslin and Kantos dont

have the benefit of Tarus training, and they dont have

specific  knowledge  about  the  PCs,  but  Tarus  can  give

them tactical commands via hand signals. Refer to the

Vampire  Tactics  sidebar  for  more  tips  on  using  the

three psychic vampires in combat.

Development: If  Tarus  decides  to  proceed  with

the hunt instead of attacking the PCs in the house, go to

encounter E.

E. THE HUNT (EL 11)

If Tarus has decided to attack the PCs during the hunt,

he brings them outside after they have had their after-

dinner drinks in the living room. He calls for Lennel to

bring  him  a  shortbow  and  the  groundskeeper  bring

him his dogs.

He then invites the PCs to follow him to a new deer

path he located just before dinner. If the PCs hesitate,

he  chides  them  and  offers  to  make  it  interesting,

betting 1,000 gold coins that he can bring down a deer

before anyone else in the group, provided that weapons

and not magic are used for the kill. Of course, Tarus has

no  intention  of  paying  this  bet,  since  he  plans  to

murder the PCs before any real hunting occurs.

Creatures: Tarus, Praslin, Kantos, and three were-

wolves accompany the PCs on the hunt.

VAMPIRE TACTICS

Tarus has been a vampire for more than a year now

and is practiced in using all of his vampire powers.

Praslin and Kantos became vampires more recently

and  are  weaker  than  Tarus,  but  they  are  still  quite

competent. In combat, all three of them make good

use of the following vampire abilities.

Wisdom  Drain  Aura: Each  of  the  three  psychic

vampires  can  use  this  ability  to  drain  1  point  of

Wisdom per round from all living creatures within 10

feet. Tarus initiates combat in the mansion (area F2)

by  taking  a  standard  action  to  activate  this  ability,

then breaking open one of the cyst-pots as a move

action if one is adjacent to him. This technique frees

one of the skulking cysts right away, so that it does-

nt  have  to  waste  time  freeing  itself.  Praslin  and

Kantos  are  less  effective  with  their  Wisdom  drain

auras, so they may use different attacks in the first

round  as  the  circumstances  merit.  However,  they

understand  that  their  combined  auras  can  quickly

leave almost any creature a catatonic mess.

Wisdom  Drain  Slam: A  psychic  vampires  slam

attack drains 1d6 points of Wisdom from any target

hit  by  it  (no  saving  throw).  Tarus  prefers  to  attack

clerics  with  this  ability  because  the  effect  can

prevent them from using their most powerful spells.

Praslin  prefers  to  rely  on  his  spells  and  Kantos  on

his  longsword,  but  Kantos  might  well  switch  to  a

slam attack if he finds his sword ineffective.

Dominate: This  ability  is  best  used  against  a

fighter  or  rogue,  who  can  then  be  directed  to  take

out one of the PC spellcasters, or possibly even to

flank  another  PC  with  Praslin,  Tarus,  or  Kantos.

Tarus and Praslin are the only ones likely to use this

ability  unless  a  potential  target  has  suffered  from

cumulative Wisdom drain effects.

Damage  Reduction: Though  damage  reduction

10/silver and magic is probably not significant to a

party  of  10th-level  adventurers,  it  does  make  the

vampires all but immune to most normal weapons,

as well as a good number of magic ones.

Gaseous  Form: Assuming  gaseous  form  is

Taruss  favorite  way  to  escape  danger,  and  since

the  fire  is  burning  low  in  the  fireplace,  he  can

easily use this ability to escape through the chim-

ney to room F14, F15, or even the grounds around

the  manor  house.  This  ability  coupled  with  his

fast  healing  makes  him  quite  difficult  to  catch.

Praslin and Kantos are under orders to fight until

destroyed,  so  they  continue  holding  off  the  PCs

even  if  Tarus  flees.  Like  any  other  vampire,

however,  they  automatically  assume  gaseous

form and retreat to their coffins if reduced to 0 or

fewer hit points.

Fast Healing: Lophar taught Tarus that returning

to  fight  another  day  is  always  better  than  dying

while making a foolish stand. With fast healing 5,

Tarus can afford to retreat for a few minutes until

he  is  once  again  at  full  hit  points,  then  stalk  the

PCs as they work their way through his home or try

to  get  back  to  town.  He  prefers  not  to  be  forced

into  gaseous  form  by  severe  damage,  since  the

healing  process  leaves  him  vulnerable  in  his

coffin, so he normally takes  gaseous form  on his

own turn if reduced to fewer than half his normal

hit  points.  As  mentioned  above,  Tarus  has

commanded Praslin and Kantos to stay and fight,

even if he retreats.

Slam: Because  all  three  vampires  have  natural

slam attacks, all of them can make attacks of oppor-

tunity  even  when  they  appear  unarmed.  Tarus  and

Praslin  take  advantage  of  this  ability  by  keeping

enemy  spellcasters  within  reach,  so  that  they  can

take  full  advantage  of  attacks  of  opportunity

provoked by spellcasting.

Readied  Casting: Praslin  prefers  to  ready  an

action  to  attack  an  enemy  mage  or  a  spell-happy

cleric, hoping to disrupt a spell by dealing damage.

This  technique  coupled  with  his  predilection  for

staying  close  to  enemy  spellcasters  and  making

slam  attacks  of  opportunity  gives  him  a  good

chance to thwart an enemys attacks every round.

E1. DEATH ON THE TRAIL

If  the  PCs  still  refuse  the  hunt,  Tarus  expresses  his

disappointment  that  the  heroes  cant  live  up  to  their

reputations. He orders his groundskeeper to bring their

horses if they rode to the mansion and dismisses them

from his presence.

Tactics: After  the  PCs  leave,  Tarus,  the  other  two

vampires, and the three werewolves pursue them. The

vampires use gaseous form to catch up, if need be. The

evil creatures first try to take out the characters mounts

(if any) to slow them down, then attack the PCs them-

selves. See the Vampire Tactics sidebar for information

on their methods.

E2. DEATH ON THE HUNT

If  the  PCs  agree  to  the  hunt,  it  proceeds  as  follows.

Tarus leads them along the path, dog leashes in hand.

The  other  two  vampires  are  present  in  their  normal

forms  if  the  PCs  do  not  seem  suspicious  of  them,  or

trailing behind in gaseous form otherwise.

Tactics: When  the  group  has  moved  a  suitable

distance from the mansion, Tarus pauses to examine a

bend in the trail, giving the other two vampires time to

materialize if they have been in gaseous form. Then he

turns  on  the  PCs,  ordering  the  werewolves  and  his

vampire  minions  to  attack.  The  group  tries  to  disable

one PC as quickly as possible, then hunt down any who

scatter. They know that any PCs who get back to town

will  spill  Taruss  murderous  plans,  so  they  do  every-

thing they can to prevent escapes.

F. KEY TO THE MANSION

The  PCs  are  likely  to  see  only  a  small  part  of  the

mansion, since Tarus directs them outside for the hunt

after a short rest in the living room (area F2). However,

a  full  description  of  the  mansion  is  provided  here  in

case combat occurs inside, or the PCs return here after

dealing with the vampires during the hunt.

GROUND FLOOR

The spacious rooms on the ground floor are much like

those in any other nobles house.

F2. Living Room (EL 8 or 13)

This  room  is  where  Tarus  brings  the  PCs  after  dinner

for  a  quiet  drink.  Read  or  paraphrase  the  following

when they enter.

A great stone fireplace occupies most of this cham-

bers east wall. The fire has burned down low and

is  now  little  more  than  coals.  Against  the  walls

stand eight wooden chairs, and four large, decora-

tive  urns  mark  the  corners  of  the  chamber.  Two

sets of double doors open into the roomone on

the north wall, and one on the south.

The urns are made of sturdy clay and painted with floral

designs. Each is large enough to hold an adult halfling

and  is  filled  with  sand  to  just  a  few  inches  below  the

rim. If asked about them, Tarus explains that the urns

were a gift from his mother and are merely decorative.

He keeps them filled with sand to prevent the servants

from  tipping  them  over  accidentallyplus,  the  sand

should come in handy in case of fire.

The  chimney  of  the  fireplace  (marked  2a  on  the

map)  splits  into  two  smaller  chimneys  between  the

ground  floor  and  the  second  floor,  and  a  smaller  fire-

place  connects  to  each  on  the  second  floor  (in  rooms

F14  and  F15).  The  fireplace  chimneys  allow  the

vampires to move quickly between floors using gaseous

form, since the low fire in this room is only a momen-

tary discomfort for someone in that state.

Creatures: In  truth,  each  of  the  four  urns

contains a skulking cyst (see the Monsters chapter in

Libris Mortis), which is under orders to stay quiet unless

Tarus calls for it or its urn is broken. In either circum-

stance,  they  spring  forth  and  attack  any  living  crea-

tures they see.

D Skulking Cysts (4): hp 26; see Libris Mortis.

F3. Sitting Room

The eight chairs and small table in this room are

probably  used  for  cozy  chats  with  guests  when  a

more intimate setting that the large living room is

desired.

F1. Foyer

The sitting room has no unusual features.

Two  wooden  pillars  separate  this  wide  entryway

from  the  next  room.  The  north,  south,  and  west

walls feature shuttered windows.

The foyer has no unusual features.

F4. Study

This chamber, obviously a study, is empty except

for  a  desk  and  padded  chair.  Some  sort  of  ledger

book and writing materials are neatly arranged on

the table.

9

Tarus  uses  the  study  to  manage  his  business  interests

and correspond with his uncle. Among the notes in the

ledger  are  some  remarks  on  local  businesses  Tarus

would like to purchase and matters about which Uncle

Lophar should be apprised.

The  preparation  of  large  and  complicated  banquets

often spills over into this room from the main kitchen.

The  servants  usually  prepare  their  own  food  here  as

well.

F9. Garden Access

F5. Dining Room

In the center of this chamber stands a 15-foot table

with eight low-backed chairs arranged around it. A

simple pair of double doors, built to resemble the

wall, leads north.

The  dining  room  has  no  unusual  features,  though  it

bears evidence of frequent use. Unlike older vampires,

Tarus  makes  an  effort  to  eat  in  front  of  his  guests  in

order to conceal his true nature.

F6. Kitchen

This chamber contains a water basin and a wood-

burning stove. Pots and pans hang from the walls

in profusion, and dishes and flatware are stacked

on shelves.

The  secret  door  leading  to  area  7  is  easily  noticed

(Search DC 15 instead of 20).

F7. Root Cellar

This small room consists mainly of an open trap-

door  in  the  floor  that  appears  to  lead  into  a  food

storage area with wall-to-wall shelves.

This  chamber  actually  is  a  root  cellar,  but  Tarus  had  a

dwarf  miner  dig  a  narrow  tunnel  from  here  to  a  spot

underneath  one  of  the  trees  to  the  north.  A  Medium

creature  can  move  through  the  passage  comfortably,

but  the  exit  hole  is  large  enough  for  only  a  Small  or

smaller creature to pass through. This arrangement isnt

an  obstacle  for  a  creature  in  gaseous  form,  and  Tarus

had the tunnel made so that he could flee if seriously

threatened.  The  exit  hole  is  overgrown  with  greenery

and resembles a small animal burrow.

F8. Pantry & Secondary Kitchen

The shelves in this room are lined with foodstuffs,

and the small basin to one side is clearly meant for

food  preparation.  The  little  table  in  the  room

doubles  as  a  cutting  surface  and  a  place  for  the

servants to eat.

Large coat hooks line the walls of this room, and a

thick  brush  of  stiff  animal  hair  is  nailed  to  the

floor near a pair of double doors.

The double doors lead to the garden. The brush is used

to clean dirt from boots or shoes so as not to track it into

the mansion.

SECOND FLOOR

The  bedchambers  and  guest  quarters  are  all  on  the

second floor.

F10. Lesser Servants Quarters (EL 1/2)

The maid and cook were brought from Lophars house-

hold, and they share this chamber.

This room is furnished with two simple beds and

two small dressers.

The chamber is unremarkable.

Creatures: The  occupants  of  this  room  are

completely  ordinary  except  that  both  have  the  Tomb-

Tainted Soul feat (see the Feats section in Libris Mortis),

which  was  forced  upon  them  by  Lophar  during  a

special ritual. Their wills are broken, and they dare not

disobey any of the vampires.

D Maid and Cook: N female human commoner

1; hp 3; Tomb-Tainted Soul feat (see Libris Mortis).

Tactics: These two servants will not fight even to

defend their own lives. If confronted by anyone other

than the vampires or Lennel, they flee.

F11. Master Servants Quarters

This  small  room  contains  a  bed,  a  chair,  a

wardrobe, and a tiny desk. The open window over-

looks the garden.

Lennel lives in this chamber. He has no belongings of

value, since he is little more than a slave with privileges.

F12. Hallway

This  hallway  leads  north  and  south  and  features

several doors and pairs of doors on either side.

10

The  doors  in  the  mansion  are  well  constructed  and

would  normally  seal  well.  However,  Tarus  has  cut  a

small notch in the bottom of each so that a vampire in

gaseous form can pass through easily.

F13. Guest Room

A high bed, table, chair, and wardrobe constitute

the furnishings of this chamber. Judging from the

layer of dust, it hasnt been used in quite a while.

Since Tarus has so few guests, this room is reserved for

Lophars use should he come to visit. Like the beds in

areas  F16,  F17,  and  F18,  this  one  has  a  coffin  cleverly

built  into  its  base.  A  series  of  tiny  holes  in  the  coffin

wall allow a gaseous vampire to access it easily.

s Wooden Coffin: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10;

break DC 13.

F14. Library (EL 3)

The  door  to  this  room  is  locked  with  a  good  physical

lock (Open Lock DC 30) and an arcane lock spell (caster

level 3rd) from Tarus wand.

Narrow bookshelves fill about half the wall space

in  this  room.  Some  of  the  shelves  are  only  half

assembled, and all of them are empty. Unopened

wooden crates take up much of the floor, and one

large wooden chest stands in the northeast corner

by the stone fireplace.

Creature:

Tarus has forbidden his servants to enter this room, and

he has been busy with other matters, so no cleaning or

organizing has been done. All of Taruss books are still in

their crates, though Tarus has opened a couple of them

and  rummaged  through  their  contents  in  search  of

particular books to look up a few local, arcane, and reli-

gious references. The six crates of books are worth a total

of 1,000 gp, but none of them are spellbooks and none

are magical in any way. The chest is closed and unlocked.

Inside  the  chest  is  a  frustrated

deathlock  (see  the  Monsters  chapter  in Libris  Mortis)

named  Archemrik,  who  was  a  sorcerer  in  life.  When

Lophar killed him, his corpse animated as a deathlock

and  began  hunting  Lophars  servants.  When  Lophar

discovered the situation, he arranged to have one of his

cleric  vampire  spawn  command  the  deathlock  into

service. Eventually, Lophar gave the deathlock to Tarus

so that the latter could heal his mortal servants without

drawing  attention  to  their  dependence  on  negative

energy instead of positive energy.

D Deathlock: hp 19; see Libris Mortis.

Tactics: The  deathlock  is  under  orders  to  remain

within  the  chest  and  use  its  inflict  minor  wounds spell-

like  ability  on  anyone  who  requests  healing.  It  can

attack only if it is attacked or if Tarus commands it to do

so. If freed, the deathlok fights its way out of the house

and tries to find Lophar again.

F15. Trophy Room (EL 7)

The  door  to  this  room  is  locked  with  a  good  physical

lock (Open Lock DC 30).

In  this  room  are  several  large  chairs  covered  in

drab cloths. A few small piles of debris have been

swept into the center of the room, and two deco-

rative  urns  about  half  the  height  of  a  grown

human stand in the corners.

Tarus  uses  this  sitting  room  to  display  his  hunting

trophies.  He  isnt  actually  interested  in  hunting  and

hasnt needed to use this room yet, so he keeps it locked

and orders his minions to leave it undisturbed.

Creatures: Tarus  has  placed  three  tomb  motes

(see the Monsters chapter in Libris Mortis) in this room

to punish any of his servants who disobey him or elim-

inate  any  too-curious  guests.  In  addition,  the  room

contains two urns like the ones in the living room (area

F2)one in the northwest corner, and the other in the

southwest corner. Each contains a skulking cyst.

D Tomb Motes (3): hp 13; see Libris Mortis.

D Skulking Cysts (2): hp 26; see Libris Mortis.

F16. Praslins Bedroom

Praslin sleeps in this chamber. The door is locked with

a good physical lock (Open Lock DC 30).

This bedroom is furnished with a high bed, a desk,

a chair, a wardrobe, and a small bookshelf.

The  bookshelves  are  empty  except  for  a  few  pages  of

notes about local spellcasters Praslin has met and some

local  ladies  with  whom  hed  like  to  spend  more  time.

He  doesnt  keep  anything  of  value  here  because  he

prefers to have all his belongings on his person in case

he needs to flee in the middle of the night.

Rather than feet, Praslins bed has a hollow, boxlike

structure at the base that serves as his coffin. During the

day, hes usually resting in the coffin.

s Wooden Coffin: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10;

F17. Kantoss Bedroom

Kantos sleeps in this chamber. The door is locked with

a good physical lock (Open Lock DC 30).

This chamber is furnished with a high bed, a desk,

a chair, a wardrobe, and a weapon rack.

Kantos was once an officer in the military, and he keeps

his room very neat. Hes actually a pretty dull individ-

ual, so he doesnt bother to decorate.

Rather than feet, Kantoss bed has a hollow, boxlike

structure at the base that serves as his coffin. During the

day, hes usually resting in the coffin.

s Wooden Coffin: 1 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 10;

F18. Master Bedroom

The  door  to  this  room  is  locked  with  a  good  physical

lock (Open Lock DC 30) and an arcane lock spell (caster

level 3rd) from Taruss wand.

This large bedroom is furnished with a high, four-

poster  bed,  three  wardrobes,  a  chair,  and  a  desk.

Three curtained glass doors on the west wall open

onto  a  balcony.  Paintings  of  hunting  scenes  and

stuffy-looking  aristocrats  hang  on  the  walls,  and

objects  of  gold  and  silver  rest  atop  most  of  the

furnishings.

Tarus spends little time here at night, since he chafes at

spending all the daylight hours confined in his protec-

tive  coffin-bed.  The  valuables  in  the  room  include  a

candlestick, a pair of nonmagical rings, and a thick gold

chain  hanging  from  a  small  wooden  rack.  The  total

value of these items is 300 gp.

CONCLUDING THE

ADVENTURE

If  the  PCs  get  the  better  of  the  three  vampires,  Tarus

tries  to  flee.  If  he  believes  that  the  PCs  still  consider

him human, he flees in human form and turns gaseous

once  hes  out  of  sight.  He  then  waits  until  the  PCs

decide to leave or until just before sunup to return to

his coffin-bed. He may also take the opportunity to any

attack lone PCs who try to search his house.

If the jig is up and its clear that Tarus is a vampire,

he flees in gaseous form, taking advantage of the tree-

tops  to  obscure  his  location  and  throw  off  pursuit.

Eventually,  he  makes  his  way  to  a  safe  spot  where  he

can hide out during daylight, then proceeds as fast as he

can to report to his uncle Lophar.

If  Tarus  is  killed,  the  PCs  may  decide  to  loot  the

mansion.  The  decorations  and  portable  valuables

therein bring about 500 gp on the open market, in addi-

tion to the valuables mentioned elsewhere in the text.

However, the mansion and its contents legally belong

to  Lophar,  and  the  elder  vampire  wastes  no  time  in

telling the local authorities that the PCs are thieves. He

eventually  sends  a  mortal  servant  to  take  care  of  the

house, working with the local law to get the PCs ousted

if necessary.

In addition, Tarus is an aristocrat, and any attack on

him  (unprovoked  or  not)  attracts  attention  from  the

authorities.  If  Tarus  is  killed  or  driven  away,  the  local

authorities  eventually  piece  together  the  fact  that  the

PCs were invited to his home on the last night he was

seen. They then begin to investigate the characters role

in Taruss disappearance. Claims that Tarus was or is a

vampire  are  not  sufficient  proof  of  their  lack  of  guilt,

and proving a missing person is a vampire is a difficult

task. Thus, the PCs are likely to remain under suspicion

for quite some timeespecially with Lophar applying

pressure to key local nobles and magistrates.

FURTHER ADVENTURES

If the PCs survive their encounter with Tarus and his

minions,  Lophar  will  try  to  kill  them  again,  though  it

may  take  him  several  months  to  marshal  enough

resources  to  do  so.  Alternatively,  the  elder  vampire

might just hire an assassin to take them out one by one.

If the PCs permanently kill Tarus, Lophar becomes

quite  angry  and  tries  to  strike  back  at  the  PCs  in  the

most harmful way possible. Lophar has been a vampire

for  more  than  twenty  years  and  an  aristocrat  for  forty

years before that, so he is accustomed to taking all the

time  he  needs  to  achieve  his  goals.  The  killing  of  his

nephew makes him cautious, so he formulates his new

plan with great care. Because Lophar is far more power-

ful  than  the  PCs,  any  direct  confrontation  they  have

with him is likely to go badly for them.

Blood  Drain  (Ex): Tarus  can  suck  blood  from  a

living  victim  with  his  fangs  by  making  a  successful

grapple check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood, deal-

ing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin

is  maintained.  On  each  successful  attack,  he  gains  5

temporary hit points.

Children  of  the  Night  (Su): Once  per  day,

Tarus  can  call  forth  1d6+1  rat  swarms,  1d4+1  bat

swarms,  or  a  pack  of  3d6  wolves  as  a  standard  action.

These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve him for

1 hour.

Create  Spawn  (Su): A  humanoid  or  monstrous

humanoid  slain  by  Taruss  energy  drain  rises  as  a

vampire spawn (see Monster Manual, page 253) 1d4 days

after  burial.  If  Tarus  instead  drains  the  victims

Constitution  to  0  or  lower,  the  victim  returns  as  a

spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had

5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn

is under Taruss command and remains enslaved until

its  masters  destruction.  At  any  given  time,  Tarus  may

have enslaved spawn totaling no more than 16 HD; any

spawn  he  creates  that  would  exceed  this  limit  are

created  as  free-willed  vampires  or  vampire  spawn.  A

vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn

of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of

lesser  vampires  in  this  fashion.  Tarus  may  voluntarily

free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn,

but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be

enslaved again.

Dominate  (Su): Tarus  can  crush  an  opponents

will just by looking into his or her eyes. This ability is

similar to a gaze attack, except that he must use a stan-

dard  action,  and  those  merely  looking  at  him  are  not

affected. Anyone Tarus targets must succeed on a DC 20

Will save or fall instantly under his influence as though

by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability

has a range of 30 feet.

Energy  Drain  (Su): A  living  creature  hit  by

Taruss slam attack gains two negative levels. For each

negative  level  bestowed,  Tarus  gains  5  temporary  hit

points. Tarus can use his energy drain ability once per

round.

Wisdom  Drain  (Su): Slam,  1d6  Wis;  see  Libris

Mortis.

Alternate  Form  (Su): Tarus  can  assume  the

shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard

action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell (caster

level 12th), except that he does not regain hit points for

changing form and must choose from among the forms

mentioned here. While in his alternate form, he loses

his  natural  slam  attack  and  dominate  ability,  but  he

gains  the  natural  weapons  and  extraordinary  special

attacks  of  his  new  form.  He  can  remain  in  that  form

until he assumes another or until the next sunrise.

Fast  Healing  (Ex): Tarus  heals  5  points  of

damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point.

If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, he automatically

assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. He must

reach  his  coffin  home  within  2  hours  or  be  utterly

destroyed. (He can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Any

additional damage dealt to Tarus while he is in gaseous

form has no effect. Once at rest in his coffin, he is help-

less.  He  regains  1  hit  point  after  1  hour,  then  is  no

longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit

points per round.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, Tarus

can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level

5th), but he can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a

fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

Spider  Climb  (Ex): Tarus  can  climb  sheer

surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.

Turn  Resistance  (Ex): Tarus  is  treated  as  a  12-

HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command,

or bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: Tarus is immune to mind-affect-

ing  effects,  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,

disease,  death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

13

Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on  objects  or  is

harmless.  He  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal

damage,  ability  damage  to  his  physical  ability  scores,

ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from massive damage. He cannot be raised, and resur-

rection  works  only  if  he  is  willing.  He  has  darkvision

out to 60 feet.

Sorcerer Spells Known (5/5 per day; caster level 1st):

0detect  magic,  mage  hand,  mending,  read  magic; 1st

Blood Drain (Ex): Kantos can suck blood from a

living  victim  with  his  fangs  by  making  a  successful

grapple check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood, deal-

ing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin

is  maintained.  On  each  successful  attack,  he  gains  5

temporary hit points.

Children  of  the  Night  (Su): Once  per  day,

Kantos  can  call  forth  1d6+1  rat  swarms,  1d4+1  bat

swarms,  or  a  pack  of  3d6  wolves  as  a  standard  action.

These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve him for

1 hour.

Create  Spawn  (Su): A  humanoid  or  monstrous

humanoid  slain  by  Kantoss  energy  drain  rises  as  a

vampire spawn (see Monster Manual, page 253) 1d4 days

after  burial.  If  Kantos  instead  drains  the  victims

Constitution  to  0  or  lower,  the  victim  returns  as  a

spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had

5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn

is under Kantoss command and remains enslaved until

its masters destruction. At any given time, Kantos may

have enslaved spawn totaling no more than 12 HD; any

spawn  he  creates  that  would  exceed  this  limit  are

created  as  free-willed  vampires  or  vampire  spawn.  A

vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn

of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of

lesser vampires in this fashion. Kantos may voluntarily

free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn,

but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be

enslaved again.

Dominate (Su): Kantos can crush an opponents

will just by looking into his or her eyes. This ability is

similar to a gaze attack, except that he must use a stan-

dard  action,  and  those  merely  looking  at  him  are  not

affected. Anyone Kantos targets must succeed on a DC

17  Will  save  or  fall  instantly  under  his  influence  as

though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The

ability has a range of 30 feet.

Energy  Drain  (Su): A  living  creature  hit  by

Kantoss slam attack gains two negative levels. For each

negative level bestowed, Kantos gains 5 temporary hit

points. Kantos can use his energy drain ability once per

round.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Kantos deals 1d6 extra points

of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or

flanked targets, or against a target that has been denied

its  Dexterity  bonus  for  any  reason.  This  damage  also

applies  to  ranged  attacks  against  targets  up  to  30  feet

away.  Creatures  with  concealment,  creatures  without

discernible  anatomies,  and  creatures  immune  to  extra

damage  from  critical  hits  are  all  immune  to  sneak

attacks. Kantos may choose to deliver nonlethal damage

with  his  sneak  attack,  but  only  when  using  a  weapon

designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Wisdom  Drain  (Su): Slam,  1d6  Wis;  see  Libris

Mortis.

Alternate  Form  (Su): Kantos  can  assume  the

shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard

action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell (caster

level 12th), except that he does not regain hit points for

changing form and must choose from among the forms

mentioned here. While in his alternate form, he loses

his  natural  slam  attack  and  dominate  ability,  but  he

14

gains  the  natural  weapons  and  extraordinary  special

attacks  of  his  new  form.  He  can  remain  in  that  form

until he assumes another or until the next sunrise.

Evasion  (Ex): If  Kantos  is  exposed  to  any  effect

that  normally  allows  him  to  attempt  a  Reflex  saving

throw  for  half  damage,  he  takes  no  damage  with  a

successful saving throw.

Fast  Healing  (Ex): Kantos  heals  5  points  of

damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point.

If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, he automatically

assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. He must

reach  his  coffin  home  within  2  hours  or  be  utterly

destroyed. (He can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Any

additional  damage  dealt  to  Kantos  while  he  is  in

gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in his coffin, he

is helpless. He regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is

no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5

hit points per round.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, Kantos

can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level

5th), but he can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a

fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

Spider  Climb  (Ex): Kantos  can  climb  sheer

surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.

Trapfinding  (Ex): Kantos  can  find,  disarm,  or

bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the

Search  skill  to  find,  and  the  Disable  Device  skill  to

disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used

to  create  it).  If  his  Disable  Device  result  exceeds  the

traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the

trap without triggering or disarming it.

Turn Resistance (Ex): Kantos is treated as a 10-

HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command,

or bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: Kantos is immune to mind-affect-

ing  effects,  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,

disease,  death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on  objects  or  is

harmless.  He  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal

damage,  ability  damage  to  his  physical  ability  scores,

ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from massive damage. He cannot be raised, and resur-

rection  works  only  if  he  is  willing.  He  has  darkvision

out to 60 feet.

ate wounds, 375 gp.

Blood Drain (Ex): Praslin can suck blood from a

living  victim  with  his  fangs  by  making  a  successful

grapple check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood, deal-

ing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin

is  maintained.  On  each  successful  attack,  he  gains  5

temporary hit points.

Children  of  the  Night  (Su):  Once  per  day,

Praslin  can  call  forth  1d6+1  rat  swarms,  1d4+1  bat

swarms,  or  a  pack  of  3d6  wolves  as  a  standard  action.

These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve him for

1 hour.

Create  Spawn  (Su): A  humanoid  or  monstrous

humanoid  slain  by  Praslins  energy  drain  rises  as  a

vampire spawn (see Monster Manual, page 253) 1d4 days

after  burial.  If  Praslin  instead  drains  the  victims

Constitution  to  0  or  lower,  the  victim  returns  as  a

spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had

5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn

is under Praslins command and remains enslaved until

its masters destruction. At any given time, Praslin may

have enslaved spawn totaling no more than 12 HD; any

spawn  he  creates  that  would  exceed  this  limit  are

created  as  free-willed  vampires  or  vampire  spawn.  A

of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of

but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be

will just by looking into his or her eyes. This ability is

similar to a gaze attack, except that he must use a stan-

dard  action,  and  those  merely  looking  at  him  are  not

15

affected. Anyone Kantos targets must succeed on a DC

18  Will  save  or  fall  instantly  under  his  influence  as

though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The

ability has a range of 30 feet.

Energy Drain (Su): A living creature hit by Praslins

slam attack gains two negative levels. For each negative

level  bestowed,  Praslin  gains  5  temporary  hit  points.

Praslin can use his energy drain ability once per round.

Wisdom  Drain  (Su): Slam,  1d6  Wis;  see  Libris

Mortis.

Alternate  Form  (Su): Praslin  can  assume  the

shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard

action. This ability is similar to a polymorph spell (caster

level 12th), except that he does not regain hit points for

changing form and must choose from among the forms

mentioned here. While in his alternate form, he loses

his  natural  slam  attack  and  dominate  ability,  but  he

gains  the  natural  weapons  and  extraordinary  special

attacks  of  his  new  form.  He  can  remain  in  that  form

until he assumes another or until the next sunrise.

Fast  Healing  (Ex): Praslin  heals  5  points  of

damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point.

If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, he automatically

assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. He must

reach  his  coffin  home  within  2  hours  or  be  utterly

destroyed. (He can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Any

additional  damage  dealt  to  Praslin  while  he  is  in

gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in his coffin, he

is helpless. He regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is

no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5

hit points per round.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, Praslin

can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level

5th), but he can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a

fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

Spider  Climb  (Ex): Praslin  can  climb  sheer

surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.

Turn Resistance (Ex): Praslin is treated as a 10-

HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command,

or bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: Praslin is immune to mind-affect-

ing  effects,  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,

disease,  death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on  objects  or  is

harmless.  He  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal

damage,  ability  damage  to  his  physical  ability  scores,

ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from massive damage. He cannot be raised, and resur-

rection  works  only  if  he  is  willing.  He  has  darkvision

out to 60 feet.

Sorcerer Spells Known (6/8*/6/4 per day; caster level

6th): 0dancing lights, detect magic, disrupt undead, mage

hand,  mending,  open/close,  read  magic; 1stcharm  person

(DC 16), identify, mage armor, magic missile; 2ndflaming

sphere (DC 17), Melfs acid arrow (+7 ranged touch); 3rd

vampiric touch (+5 melee touch).

Praslin normally casts mage armor well in advance

of any expected hostile encounter, so he has only seven

1st-level spell slots available per day.

Possessions:  Bracers  of  armor  +1,  ring  of  protection  +1,

cloak of resistance +1, wand of darkness (40 charges), scroll

of stone shape, scroll of solid fog, 86 gp.
