Introduction

Among the most iconic elements of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS

game are its unforgettable monsters. Dragons roam the skies,

seeking towns to burn and plunder. Hordes of ravening orcs

lurk  sullenly  in  the  wastelands  and  barren  places,  waiting

for the chance to sweep down on the unsuspecting lands of

humankind. Demons and devils pry and push at the borders

of  their  infernal  planes,  seeking  the  opportunity  to  enter

the world and wreak their terrible evil. Bizarre, antediluvian

monstrositiesthings of deadly eyes, squirming tentacles, and

mind-poisoning horrorlurk in the deep and remote places,

dreaming terrible alien dreams of conquest and dominion over

the world outside. These are the aberrations, creatures whose

very existence outrages nature, creatures that belong to distant

times and dimensions of cosmic terror.

THE BOOK OF

ABERRATIONS

While  this  book  might  seem  to  be  intended  primarily  for

Dungeon Masters, the monsters discussed in this tome are so

powerful, iconic, and prevalent in the D&D universe that any

player wishing to know more about his characters adversaries

should  be  interested  in  the  information  contained  herein.

Chapter 9 includes a number of feats, spells, and prestige classes

for characters whose principal enemies include monsters of the

aberration type. While the focus of this book is on aberrations,

many of these new rules elements can apply to other creatures.

New aboleth, illithid, and silthilar (a new aberration swarm)

grafts can bene t an adventurer in any sort of campaign, as

can any of several new domains and magic items.

Naturally, Dungeon Masters will  nd dozens of new mon-

sters, monster feats, monster spells, and tremendous amounts

of hidden lore about these same creatures. Everything you need

to highlight an iconic aberration race in your campaign (or to

survive such an event, if you are a player) can be found in this

book.  Each  chapter  devoted  to  one  of  the  major  aberration

races  also  includes  an  encounter  site,  complete  with  keyed

locations and  ready to be used in an existing campaign.

Unlike the creatures that populate Draconomicon or Libris

Mortis, aberrations share few common characteristics other

than a broad thematic link. Other than the fact that theyre

all  inhuman  monsters  that  have  powerful  magical  abili-

ties  and  dwell  deep  underground,  aboleths,  mind   ayers,

and beholders do not really share any common origins or

physiology.  Therefore,  the  major  races  of  aberrations  are

each discussed in their own chapter, with little reference

to other aberrations.

The major aberration races include the following monsters:

Aboleths, or the deep masters, are the loathsome lords of the

underground seas. Perhaps the most alien and inscrutable of

all the major aberration races, the aboleths are mighty psions

and mages whose sinister in uence wells up from the deepest

places in the earth.

Beholders,  the  terrible  eye  tyrants,  command  fearsome

innate magical power. With a single glance they kill, paralyze,

confuse, or enslave their foes. Rapacious and arrogant, a single

beholder can easily become the overlord of its own realm of

evil.

Mind   ayers, or illithids, are brilliant, cruel, and terrify-

ing creatures. Mind  ayers might comprise the single most

dangerous threat to the dominion of humanoids in the daylight

lands of the surface world.

Neogi,  the  slave  takers,  are  a  race  of  greedy  and  sinister

merchants who spin their webs of gold and misery across the

human world.

Grell, or the eaters, are an alien race of predators that haunt

the wild and lonely places of the world. Armed with an inde-

cipherable admixture of alchemy and science, the fearsome

grell ruthlessly destroy all other races that blunder into their

territory.

The  Tsochari,  or  the  wearers  of  the   esh,  are  a  race  of

invasive parasites that wear the stolen bodies of their victims

so that they can pass in human society.

The  six  races  mentioned  here  pose  the  most  widespread

and virulent threats to humans and other good races. They

combine magical power, ruthless genius, and cold, calculating

malice; they are alien and inscrutable, things born of madness

and nightmare. Brave indeed are the heroes who venture into

their domains.

Of course, the Far Realm and the deep, dark places of the

earth are responsible for spawning forth many more creatures

than these. Many other aberrations can be found in this book,

including the half-farspawn, a new template for the offspring

of creatures that have consorted with aberrations; the psionic

psurlon; and the bizarre silthilar, masters of grafts.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Lords  of  Madness  makes  use  of  the  information  in  the  three

D&D  core  rulebooksPlayers  Handbook,  Dungeon  Masters

Guide,  and  Monster  Manual.  In  addition,  it  includes  refer-

ences to material from several D&D supplements, including

Fiend Folio, Monster Manual II, Epic Level Handbook, Miniatures

Handbook,  Libris  Mortis,  and  Expanded  Psionics  Handbook,  as

well as the FORGOTTEN REALMS supplements Underdark and

Unapproachable East. Although possession of any or all of these

supplements will enhance your enjoyment of this book, they

are not strictly necessary.

o single common characteristic easily distinguishes

an aberration from any other sort of creature, or

signals a kinship to creatures of this type. Some

are intelligent, some are not; some are humanoid in

shape, some  are  not;  some  possess  innate  magical  powers,

and some do not. This book is chie y concerned with those

aberrations  that  pose  a  pervasive  and  signi cant  threat  to

humankind. While a creature such as a carrion crawler is

certainly  a  dangerous  monster,  it  lacks  the  intelligence  to

entertain dark schemes against the creatures of the world

above. It is simply an unreasoning beast, albeit an unusually

bizarre and alien one.

Creatures such as aboleths, beholders, and mind  ayers are

far more signi cant because they represent entire societies of

unhuman and amoral intelligences that regard humans and

humanoids as potential slaves at best, or, more likely, bleating

cattle awaiting slaughter. These intelligent, evil aberrations

do share some common characteristics, even if they are not

remotely related to one another.

THE CODEX ANATHEMA

Over a thousand years ago, the wizard known as Iphegor of the

Ebon Mirror composed a terrible book, the Codex Anathema. A

student of distant places, times, and planes, Iphegor plumbed

the depths of space and reality with the aid of the Ebon

Mirror, a powerful artifact that allowed him to see into

strange and terrible places indeed. The Codex Anathema

records  the  frightful  visions  he  observed  in  the  Ebon

Mirror,  along  with  rambling  essays  in  which  Iphegor

describes his own  ndings and conclusions about mat-

ters no sane being should dwell on for long.

The Codex includes accounts of astral voyages into

the dim antediluvian eons when aboleths ruled over

the world, frenetic narratives about passages into the

depths of the Far Realm, and dialogues with illithid

sages and tsochari imposters. Studies and observations

about creatures such as beholders, chuuls, psurlons,

and  beings  clearly  originating  outside  of  nature

comprise a large part of the Codex. Overall, the book

is poorly organized, consisting of a haphazard col-

lection of essays, narratives, notes, and odd arcane

formulae  jotted  down  in  whatever  order  Iphegor

happened to think of them.

No one knows Iphegors  nal fate, but it is said

that the Ebon Mirror still exists, buried in some

dreadful dungeon. To stare into its depths is to risk

life and sanityyet secrets of untold power might lie

within its starry void.

ORIGINS OF THE

ABERRATIONS

Aberrations as a kind seem to cry out for explanation. Other

monsters  are  part  of  the  natural  world,  or  come  into  being

through the actions of natural beings, but aberrations have no

place in the usual order of things. Their origins are unthinkably

distant in time, space, or planar cosmology. While they are

now natives of the Material Plane (they would be outsiders if

they were not), aberrations share little or no kinship with the

other living creatures of the world.

As a DM, de ning an origin for a major aberration race you

intend  to  feature  in  your  campaign  will  help  you  to  create

plots and schemes for that race. For example, a race older than

the world itself might retain memories or lore of extremely

ancient events. Heroes who  nd that they need to understand

how a god died thousands of years ago, or where and when a

very  ancient  artifact  was  last  seen,  might  discover  that  the

knowledge they seek exists only in the secret lorepools of the

aboleths. Aberrations that came from distant worlds might have

an insatiable appetite for human slaves and wealth to send back

to their alien  homelands through magical doorways. Races

that exist through the intervention or corruption of a dark and

terrible god might seek ways to fully wake their progenitor, or

form insidious cults to capture the worship of lesser beings,

such as humanoids, for their divine master.

OUT OF SPACE

from  the  remote  reaches  of  the  Material  Plane  come  from

worlds such as these, places stranger and more menacing than

all but the most fearsome of Outer Planes.

Because these far worlds are still part of the Material Plane,

it  is  possible  to  reach  them  via  greater  teleport,  teleport  circle,

and similar magic. In fact, it is possible for vessels with the

proper magic to voyage between the worlds without any sort of

teleportation. Flying ships (sometimes known as spelljammers)

can reach the moon(s), nearby planets, or possibly even the

worlds of other stars altogether. Journeying to a nearby world,

whether it is the moon of the characters own native world or a

different planet in its own right, might require anything from

a few hours to months or even years of star-sailing.

The neogi are perhaps the best-known example of an extra-

terrestrial race. Descending from the dark night skies in their

sinister, spiderlike  ying ships, these rapacious slavers and oily

merchants wander from world to world, trading with those

strong  enough  to  warrant  caution  and  stealing  from  those

who are not. Neogi merchants enjoy access to the resources

and markets of many worlds, and few can follow them when

they depart for their next destination. Slaves taken by the neogi

rarely, if ever, see their homelands again.

The tsochari also hail from a distant world, a cold and light-

less place of terrible black ruins and endless, shrieking winds.

Unlike the neogi, who move from world to world so easily

that they themselves do not recall the world of their origin,

the tsochari do not build starfaring vessels. They must labor

long and hard to create the magical gates that allow them to

venture between worlds.

Most intelligent creatures live their lives on a single world in

the Material Plane, and do not dream that the Material Plane

includes anything other than the world they know. However,

the Material Plane is indeed an in nite plane. It is  lled with

countless  worlds,  so  inconceivably  far  removed  from  one

another that only the most powerful of wizards can hope to

travel from world to world. Each of these Material Plane worlds

possesses its own unique conditions, and some of these distant

worlds nourish strange and inimical forms of life. Aberrations

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Just as the origins of an alien race can be physically remote

from the normal world, they can also be temporally removed

from the world humans know. Some aberrations do not hail

from places where the rules are different, but instead originate

in times when the world is, was, or will be a very different

place than it is now.

OUT OF TIME

ABERRATIONS IN EBERRON

Nearly everything in this book is perfectly usable if you are run-

ning a campaign in the world of the EBERRON campaign setting.

After all, one of the guiding principles of the EBERRON setting is

If it exists in D&D, it exists in Eberron. That said, aberrations

have a unique role in Eberron that might change how you use

some material in this book.

Millennia ago, a bizarre and alien race called the daelkyr in-

vaded Eberron through planar portals leading from their home

plane of Xoriat, the Realm of Madnessa plane similar to the

Far Realm discussed in this book. While on Eberron, the daelkyr

created  many  of  the  known  species  of  aberrations,  including

beholders and chokers. Mind flayers served as the lieutenants

of the daelkyr, and originated with them on the plane of Xoriat,

making them extraplanar aberrations when they appear on Eb-

erron. New kinds of aberrations are found on Eberron as well,

including dolgrims and dolgaunts.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Aberrations that venture near human habitation are frequently

the focal point of degenerate cults loosely termed the Cults of

the Dragon Below. Cultists of the Dragon Below are insane, be-

lieving that aberrations are beautiful and holy creatures that can

lead them to a subterranean promised land or reward them with

annihilation when they bring the daelkyr up from the depths to

destroy the world.

Most  of  this  information  amounts  to  background  details

about  the  various  kinds  of  aberrations,  and  has  little  impact

on  their  actual  use  in  play.  The  vast  majority  of  the  informa-

tion contained in Lords of Madness, including details about the

anatomy, society, abilities, and tactics of various aberrations,

is just as true in the EBERRON setting as in any other D&D cam-

paign. Simply alter or ignore details about the origins of differ-

ent aberrations presented in this book, placing them instead in

the context of the ancient daelkyr invasion.

6

For  most  purposes,  there  is  little  difference  between  an

origin remote in space and one remote in time. An alien and

unforgiving world is an alien and unforgiving world. However,

unlike aberrations out of space, aberrations out of time cannot

easily return to their original homes. The journey from eon

to eon is much more dif cult than the journey from planet

to  planet,  and  only  the  mightiest  and  most  dreadful  magic

can do the trick. There are exceptionscreatures that move

through the timestream as easily as a human sails from port

to port along a well-charted coastbut in general, aberrations

from distant times are completely severed from their places of

origin, never to return.

Antediluvian Aberrations

Aberrations hailing from exceedingly ancient times are the

remnants or survivors of an ancient world, now replaced by

the  world  that  seems  normal  or  natural  to  humans.  Some

predate creation itself, existing as the last vestiges of a previ-

ous creation, an older multiverse in which the rules were very

different. While this would imply a span of billions of years in

our own universe, in the fantastic universe of the D&D game

the creation of the world might be far more recent, a span of

a few hundred or few thousand years. Creatures of antiquity

deeply resent the arrival of brash new humanoid races and

creator deities who erased the ancient predecessor universe

and  replaced  it  with  a  less  hospitable  (to  the  aberrations,

anyway) world.

Aboleths are the best example of a race with this origin. Long

ago, they populated an earlier creation  lled with creatures

of similar physiology and temperament, a cold and horrible

world of  perpetual darkness. This incredibly ancient world

died, and the world of humans, dragons, and sunlight replaced

it, to the aboleths everlasting anger. Since aboleths retain the

memories of their progenitors in an unbroken line stretching

back thousands of years, they still recall the earlier cosmos and

long for the return of more favorable conditions.

Travelers in Time

Other  aberrations  hail  from  the  future  instead  of  the  past.

Depending on the amount of time involved, they possess strik-

ing insights into impending events for those who live in the

younger age, explaining in part their ability to anticipate and

pqqqqqqqqqrs

VARIANT ORIGINS

While this discussion proposes specific origins for each major

aberration race, there is no reason you cant alter these racial

origins  for  your  own  campaign.  In  most  cases  the  origins

are so distant (in time or space) that it doesnt really matter

much to game play where a particular aberration comes from;

theyre here now, and thats enough. If you prefer mind flayers

to be from distant worlds or alternate Material Planes instead

of the remote future, feel free to stipulate that origin in your

own game.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

plan for events in the world around them. Some future-born

aberrations returned to the past to speci cally engineer the

events that will make their own world possiblea paradoxical

destiny against which the cosmos itself rebels.

The  mind   ayers  are  the  most  notable  example  of  these

time-lost aberrations, although only a handful of the illithid

savants (and likely no living member of any other race) know

of the races secret origin. A starfaring race of great power exist-

ing at the very end of time, the mind  ayers faced extinction

with the imminent ending of all things. Through a great and

terrible spell, the mind  ayers dispatched great spelljamming

 eets from the cold, pitiful remnants of their dying cosmos

back through time, appearing in the ancient skies of younger

worlds. They arrived in the present era two thousand years

ago (although the exact date varies from world to world, since

their time-traveling magic produced different results as they

journeyed into different cosmologies). The enslavement of the

gith and the duergar dates back to early years of the illithid

invasion of the present era.

Naturally, sages perusing accounts of mind  ayer ships in

the night sky believe that mind  ayers hail from another world,

never suspecting that the illithid race also comes from another

time. As extratemporal creatures, mind  ayers know dark and

dire things about events to come, including the eventual rise

of their race and the end of the multiverse. To ensure that they

will indeed come to exist at all, they pursue a strange and secret

agenda of manipulating the world of their own past, the world

humans and their kin must share with them. The mind  ayers

know that their plans cannot fail, because they clearly exist;

ultimate victory is inevitable.

Otherwhens

Finally, some aberrations might come from worlds with alter-

nate  historiesplanets  where  evolutionary  events,  magical

cataclysms,  or  the  will  of  dark  deities  perverted  the  world

from its normal and natural course. On the surface, such a

world  would  seem  to  be  little  different  from  a  planet  from

some far corner of space or a world existing in an alternate

Material  Planebut  these  otherwhen  worlds  are  perhaps

even more strange and shocking, because they are so similar

to the mundane world, and yet horribly, terribly wrong.

In some cases, these otherwhens are not entirely real. They

possess only the potential to be real. As the real world grows

more distant, in time or history, from the point of divergence

that  might  have  given  rise  to  the  otherwhen  world,  the

otherwhen world begins to fade into the nothingness from

which it came. Powerful and knowledgeable aberration races,

recognizing the illusory nature of their mirror existence, seek

to anchor their mirror-world as the real one, thus preserving

themselves by causing the extinction of the real world. It might

be possible to do this by performing some terrible rite or spell,

or by searching out all the consequences of the divergence

event in the real world and undoing them one by one. Since

their existence itself is at stake, aberrations from a short-lived

otherwhen are capable of unthinkable acts that to other races

might seem works of random and meaningless evil.

No  known  aberration  races  hail  from  such  a  perversion

of the proper course of things, but the possibility cannot be

dismissed.

THE PLANES

Various aberrations have their origins in the in nite variety

of  planes  that  exist  beyond  the  Material

Plane.  Just  like  worlds  distant  in

time  or  space,  the  stranger  and

more  remote  planes  are

places  where  the  very  laws

of  nature  no  longer  apply.

Capricious  gods,  bizarre

magical  phenomena,  and

alien environments all com-

bine to populate the planes

with  strange  and  fearful

beings.

Planar  denizens

are  outsiders  or  ele-

mentalsbeings that

might better be regard-

ed as spirits manifested

in corporeal forms. Howev-

er, planes such as the Abyss,

Pandemonium, or Gehenna

are  also  home  to  creatures

that  are  every  bit  as  phys-

ical  as  humanoids.  Few

aberration  races  are  pow-

erful  enough  to  challenge

the  great  outsider  races  for

dominance of a plane, but planar-

dwelling aberrations control or infest

portions of nongood planes.

Aberrations  from  distant  planes  are  in

some ways closer to their origins than aber-

rations from space. Spells such as plane shift,

shadow walk, gate, or astral projection offer ready

access to distant planesand, unlike a teleport

spell, its possible to set off without knowing precisely where

youre going.

Far Realm

While aberrations do roam the depths of the Nine Hells and

the fetid layers of the Abyss, they are especially common in one

planethe Far Realm. The Far Realm represents the very edge

of creation, the place that exists at the borders of conception.

What lies beyond it is physically inconceivable and cannot be

brought into existence. It is possible that the Far Realm exists

as both a spatial and temporal frontier as well as a planar one,

and that a traveler who moves through space or time to the ends

of the universe could reach the Far Realm in much the same

way that a planar traveler could. If explorers have attempted

such a journey, they have not returned to tell the tale.

Wherever the Far Realm truly lies, it is a place where all

natural law runs amok. Aberrations are spawned in its in nite

madness, and some of these  nd their waythrough space,

through time, or most commonly through planar travelto

the  mundane  realms  of  humanoids.  Cloakers,  the  strange

and  sinister  beings  that  haunt  the  black

underground  depths,  originated

in the Far Realm and came to the

normal  world  long  ago.  Like-

wise,  the  terrible  psurlons,

psionic  monsters  of  great

strength,  also  arose  in  the

Far Realm.

Ethereal Plane

Alternate Material Planes

Beyond  the  Plane  of  Shadow  lie  entire  cosmologies  only

guessed at by the sages and clerics of humankind. Some of

these  alternate  cosmologies  strongly  resemble  the  familiar

multiverse, but others are strange and hostile places. Much

like the otherwhen worlds or planets remote in time or space,

alternate Material Planes are places where almost anything

could be true.

Travel  from  one  Material  Plane  to  another  is  dif cult  at

best.  The  roads  through  the  Plane  of  Shadow  are  dim  and

confusing, and few can  nd a path leading in the direction

they wish to travel. Nevertheless, some creatures have made

the  journeyincluding  the  bizarre  grell,  which  emigrated

from another Material Plane only a few generations past.

Aberrations  native  to  entirely  different  multiverses  and

cosmologies do not always come through the Plane of Shadow

to reach the normal world. Various forms of gates and other

world-spanning  magic  permit  a  knowledgeable  traveler to

reach an entirely different world with a mere step.

DREAMS OF MAD GODS

Not all deities belong to the pantheons of human or humanoid

gods. Dark and powerful divinities with little or no interest

in humankind lurk in the universe, seeking only to propagate

their own alien visions of creation and existence. Whether as a

deliberate act or as a simple side effect of their own existence,

these alien divinities create monstrous beings to terrorize and

corrupt the world of humankind.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

terrifying and powerful, but the process of creating chuuls was

slow  and  difficult.  They  could  not  be  produced  quickly  or  in

great quantities. After about a century of steady work, he had

assembled approximately six hundred chuuls. Ashranezr was a

patient man, but not that patient.

Rather  than  continuing  to  build  in  complete  secrecy,

Ashranezr decided to put his six hundred chuuls to work. While

he expanded his army, they aided his cause by disrupting the

flow of daily life in nearby kingdoms and empires. The wizard

sent his chuuls in teams to assassinate generals, attack ship-

ping, raid coastal towns, and spread terror and chaos wherever

they could.

THE ORIGIN OF THE CHUULS

The monstrous, rapacious chuuls are a created race, brought

into existence artificially through magic and science.

Chuuls were created several hundred years ago by the arch-

wizard and would-be emperor Ashranezr. A man of rare genius

and ambition, he was also quite mad. Regarding himself as an

incipient deity, he set his sights on nothing less than the con-

quest of the world.

Ashranezr first attracted notice because of his unique physi-

cal  characteristics:  He  was  half-man  and  half-sahuagin,  but

not  by  birth.  Through  self-surgery  and  magical  techniques  of

his  own  devising,  he  had  infused  himself  with  the  hardiness,

strength, and savagery of the sea devils. None of his notes sur-

vived his demise, and he had no pupils or apprentices, so the

exact process of transformation was lost with him. Most would

judge that to be a good thing.

Ashranezrs home lay in an island chain, in an unknown lo-

cation beneath the water. In his submerged stronghold, using

the secret procedures perfected on his own body, he began ex-

perimenting with the breeding and alteration of other creatures.

Strange, hybrid creatures were commonly seen in the vicinity of

his lab for many years, but none were replicated in large num-

bers or caused much havoc. During those years, Ashranezr was

considered to be an extreme eccentric, but not terribly danger-

ous. He kept to himself, and his odd creatures, while startling,

were short-lived and shy. Nearby wizards guilds gradually lost

interest in Ashranezrs activities and left him completely alone.

That was what he wanted.

At the culmination of decades of research and experimenta-

tion,  Ashranezr  bred  the  first  chuulspart  crustacean,  part

insect, and part amphibianto serve as terrifying warriors in the

army of conquest he dreamed of creating. The chuuls were not

Ashranezrs first creations, but they were his first true success.

The chuuls were not simply altered from existing creatures.

They  were  entirely  new  creations,  with  attributes  and  powers

never  before  seen  in  natural  creatures.  At  the  beginning,  the

greatest  obstacle  was  their  short  life  span.  Typically,  one  of

Ashranezrs hybrid creatures would survive only a few months

or a year before suffering fatal tissue decay. When the wizard

found  the  solution  for  this  problem,  he  didnt  merely  extend

their  lives  to  a  normal  duration.  He  hit  upon  a  method  that

eliminated  aging  entirely.  Barring  violence,  Ashranezrs  crea-

tures would live forever.

With his great breakthrough, Ashranezrs dreams of godhood

reached  fruition.  He  could  (and  did)  easily  make  himself  im-

mortal. How could such a man bow to any mortal? What sort

of position could the world offer a man such as Ashranezr? The

only reward worthy of his genius was an honor that did not exist:

to be emperor of the entire world.

The first step would be to create an army of chuuls.  Ashranezrs

soldiers could survive nearly anywhere, land or sea. They were

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

It  was  a  terrible  miscalculation.  While  Ashranezr  kept  to

himself, the world paid no attention to him. When he turned

his monsters loose against his neighbors, it didnt take schol-

ars long to rediscover what had been forgotten about the ec-

centric wizard who created abominable lifeforms from bits of

numerous creatures and who had transformed himself into a

part-man, part-fish monstrosity.

With  his  chuuls  dispersed  across  the  world  looking  for

trouble, Ashranezr himself had little means of defending him-

self against the magical assault loosed against him. In only a

few months his lair was located and stormed, and Ashranezr

himself was slain in a magical onslaught.

His chuuls, however, were still loose. They never received

any instructions to desist. Unaware that their creator was dead,

they continued wreaking havoc as ordered. Their depredations

slowed down over the centuries as attrition and madness took

their toll. The surviving chuuls now proceed cautiously. Some

learned  of  Ashranezrs  death  and  abandoned  his  program.

Others  abandoned  their  original  instructions  in  order  to

pursue their own agendas. Some reverted to little more than

clever but wild beasts, due to defects in their construction.

Of the six hundred first chuuls created by Ashranezr, per-

haps  two  hundred  have  survived  the  centuries  since  their

creators destruction. Each one of these survivors is extraor-

dinarily large, strong, clever, and cruel. From these first-born

chuuls, generations of younger, lesser chuuls have spawned.

(For game purposes, the first chuuls are advanced specimens

of Huge size and maximum Hit Dice, while the succeeding

generations  are  represented  by  the  standard  chuul  in  the

Monster Manual.) Without the special procedures and infu-

sions  of  Ashranezrs  laboratories  to  strengthen  them  and

extend  their  lifespan,  these  chuul-spawn  are  mortal,  living

little more than one hundred years. They lack the power of

their specially bred forebears. However, they are far more nu-

merous, and their numbers are slowly growing. While chuuls

might never conquer the world as Ashranezr once dreamed,

they have certainly brought terror, havoc, and death to many

lands and waters.

Aberrations spawned by alien deities might or might not be

aware of their origin. Some worship their progenitors, divine

beings shunned by all other gods and races. Others despise

the callous divinities that birthed and then abandoned them

to existence in an inimical universe. Aberrations born of a

deitys power or interest seek to appease or serve the divinity

in question through fervid worship and the sacri ce of beings

they deem enemies of their alien god. By founding widespread

cults and destroying the worshipers of conventional gods, they

hope to weaken the humanoid pantheons and make possible

the ascendancy of their own deities.

Beholders are the best known of the godspawned aberrations.

The cryptic being known as the Great Mother has no place in

any other pantheon, but from the moment it  rst entered the

multiverse, it began to seed its progeny, the multifarious race

of beholders, throughout the world. Every beholder that exists

is merely a re ection of the Great Mothers will and instinct

to replicate itself.

Destrachans likewise arise from the dark dreams of a name-

less god, but they revile their creator (and all gods, for that

matter). No nondestrachan knows the purpose or identity of

the sinister being that created these monsters.

MAGICAL MUTATION

Some  aberrations  are  created  through  the  actions  of  other

mortals. With powerful enough magic, the laws of nature can

be  perverted  to  manufacture  mockeries  of  other  creatures.

Sometimes  this  magical  mutation  is  purely  accidental,  the

unintended result of some terrible cataclysm or curse. All too

often it is a deliberate act. Twisting life itself into pleasing or

convenient forms is evil and reckless, a blasphemous deed that

frequently leads to unforeseen consequencesbut the desire

to create the perfect warrior, or the most fearsome servant, has

led more than one archmage into folly.

Aberrations created through magical mutation tend to be

few in number and rarely have much of a racial history, since

they originated in a speci c program or event that might only

be a few decades or centuries old. They are solitary brutes as

opposed to evil masterminds. Wizards who are interested in

creating slave-soldiers or useful servants dont go out of their

way to breed highly intelligent creations for fear of creating

things  with  the  ruthlessness  and  genius  to  supplant  their

masters.

The chuul and the umber hulk provide examples of aber-

rations created through magical mutation. Strong, hardy, and

armed with powerful natural weaponry, both races were bred

as slave-soldiers. The creators of the umber hulks are lost in the

deeps of time; umber hulks have been extant for thousands

of years now. Chuuls, on the other hand, were created several

hundred  years  ago  by  an  evil  mage-king  who  dreamed  of

conquering vast territory with an army of his own creation.

Although the mage-king was defeated by an alliance of the

neighboring realms, and his keep was destroyed, his army of

chuuls escaped to plague the world thereafter.

ABERRATION

CHARACTERISTICS

Whatever their speci c origin, the great aberration races share

several  common  characteristics,  even  if  they  are  unrelated

physically. While there exist other creatures that are evil mas-

terminds, or that are hateful to nature, or that are unspeakably

unhuman, few combine these traits in the same way that the

dangerous aberrations of the world do.

Not all aberrations possess all of the following characteris-

tics, but most possess these traits to at least some degree.

SINISTER MASTERMINDS

The master aberration racesaboleths, beholders, and mind

 ayers, speci callyare all extraordinarily intelligent, per-

ceptive, and strong willed. While individual humans might

match a particular aberration in intellect, wisdom, or force

of personality, only a handful of humans possess the overall

mental strength of the typical aboleth or mind  ayer. Only the

most powerful of human wizards come close to the vast lore

and  incisive  logical  capability of  an  exceptional  aberration,

such as an aboleth savant or mind  ayer mage.

Not only do aberrations possess the natural gift of mental

strength,  they  have  also  amassed  tremendous  amounts  of

lore and learning. The great aberration races understand that

knowledge is power. For generation after generation they have

devoted themselves to the pursuit of knowledge in any form,

con dent that their efforts will be rewarded with unmatched

magical or psionic power.

This  frightful  intelligence  means  that  aberrations  are

masterful  schemers,  patient  and  subtle.  They  routinely

contemplate complex and subtle plans requiring lifetimes to

unfold. Their plans have few weaknesses, and they anticipate

the  exact  moment  at  which  an  enemy  is  likely  to  become

aware of their plotsand what course of action the enemy

is likely to take in response. Master aberrations are far more

likely  to  ambush  or  trap  a  would-be  attacker  than  to  be

surprised by their foes.

As  masterminds  with  the  natural  ability  to  dominate  or

enslave their minions, aberrations surround themselves with

a cadre of the most useful guards, slaves, and agents they can

 nd. Brutes such as minotaurs, trolls, ogres, or even giants

guard  the  outposts  and  lairs  of  master  aberrations.  Human

adventurers  are  captured,  turned  into  spies  and  assassins,

and sent back into the lands above to gather information for

their sinister masters and to strike against those who would

oppose  the  dark  in uence  of  the  aberrations  below.  Better

yet, a few whispered rumors or carefully planned leaks of

fabricated evidence might turn a company of adventurers into

the unwitting servants of the unseen masters without a single

confrontation.

Countering a plot of a master aberration is rarely as simple

as  nding a lair and attacking. First, the heroes must somehow

discern the presence of a faceless enemy that moves in the

shadows, manipulating other creatures in the same way that

a chess master moves his pieces. Then, the would-be heroes

must  ght their way through ranks of dupes, underlings, and

mind-slaves, some of whom might not even realize that they

serve a master aberration. They must pierce layers of secrecy,

lies, and false leads planted by a brilliant and patient antagonist.

Then,  nally, they must confront their unhuman foe in a time

and place of the aberrations choosing, since the master aber-

ration observes the heroes efforts against its underlings and

dispassionately determines the best way to exercise its own

terrible power to end the threat the heroes pose to its agenda,

whatever that might be.

INIMICAL TO

NATURE

Aberrations  have  no  rightful

place in the natural order of

things.  They  are  interlop-

ers  and  invaders,  creatures

whose  presence  damages

the fragile chains of being

that  define  the  natu-

ral  world.  A  monster

such as a chuul is more

than a large and voracious

predator,  it  is  an  affront  to

nature.  Nothing  in  na-

ture  feeds  on  a  chuul,

and nothing in

nature possess-

es  the  instincts

or  behavior  to  avoid

the  monster.  Its  depreda-

tions, if allowed to continue

unchecked,  eventually  de-

populate a wide swath of territory,

destroying all normal fauna in its

vicinity.

Aberration  civilizations  are

even more dangerous to the

natural order. Master aberra-

tions such as aboleths or mind

 ayers  see  no  value  in  any  kind  of  natural

state.  All  things  are  theirs  to  manipulate  or

de le as they deem appropriate. Worse yet, some aberrations

actively seek to corrupt or alter their environs to suit their tastes

and needs. Armed with ruthless intellects, powerful magic,

and absolute amorality, master aberrations see no reason not to

warp natural creatures into guardian monsters for their dens,

create magical plagues to drive off inconvenient neighbors, or

spread foliage poisonous to all other creatures across a forest

to provide themselves with a better environment.

As despoilers and corruptors of the natural world, aberra-

tions have earned the unending enmity of druids. Aberrations

seek to pervert the natural world to their own purposes. Per-

haps deliberately, most aberrations dwell deep underground,

where few druids contest their depredations.

UNHUMAN

Creatures such as beholders or mind  ayers are certainly evil

in the traditional sensethey are rapacious, greedy, self-serv-

ing, ambitious, murderous, and utterly unscrupulous. They are

not necessary malicious, however, since they do not commit

evil acts simply for the sake of doing evil. Instead, master ab-

errations regard themselves as exempt from any lesser races

notions of morality or decency. A mind  ayer would argue that

notions such as good and evil are sim-

ply relativistic, self-determined,

and ultimately pointless exer-

cises in justifying strength

or weakness to oneself. If

you  regard  destroying

a  sentient  creature  for

your  own  sustenance

as evil, then how is the

mind  ayer to regard it-

self  as  de ned  by  your

ideas  on  the  subject?  It

must eat to survive, after

all, and surviving clearly

cant  be  an  evil  end

when all things desire

survival.

Beyond the question

of their amorality, mas-

ter  aberrations  regard

themselves  as  innately

superior  to  all  other

beings. Their potent

physical,  magical,

and  psionic  gifts

clearly  give  them

the power to behave

as  they  please  to-

ward  others  who

lack  similar  gifts.  Why

adopt a set of ethical restrictions

that would interfere with the exercise

of  power  in  whatever  fashion  seems  most  useful  and  nec-

essary at the time? Aberrations have no better nature, no

good side, no sense of justice or propriety to which a captive

might hope to appeal.

The  evil  of  a  master  aberration  is  clinical,  detached,  and

brutally logical. Cold and unemotional creatures such as mind

 ayers or beholders see no value in the emotional arguments

or wishes of lesser creaturesand things without value are

not considered when action is required.

PERILOUS LORE

Learning too much about an aberration race is dangerous in

the extreme. Not only do the aberrations themselves object

to any attempt to study their secrets, the actual results of the

effort are injurious to the humanoid psyche. No mage sleeps

better after learning the language of the aboleths, mastering

spells devised by mind  ayers, or exploring the alchemical

science of the grell. There are things that humanoids were

not meant to know.

In order to truly comprehend some artifact of a master

aberrations  mentalityits  language,  its  magic,  its  own

comprehension  of  the  mundane  worldit  is  necessary

to absorb concepts and symbologies that are drastically at

variance with human norms. The more one studies these

things, the more dif cult it is to set aside these concepts and

return to normal modes of thought and speech. Eventually,

it becomes impossible, and sanity (at least, as humans de ne

it) is lost altogether. As tempting as it might be to study the

mighty spells or psionic powers of the mind  ayers, these

things carry a terrible risk for the reckless mage or psion.

The best thing to do with an aberrations spellbook or power

stone is to bury it someplace where it will never see the light

of day again.

In  general,  the  more  atypical  the  creatures  origin,  the

less healthy it is to know too much about it. Creatures such

as  beholders  or  umber  hulks  are  frightening,  but  do  not

normally threaten ones reason. On the other hand, creatures

spawned  in  especially  inimical  places  or  timesprevi-

ous  universes,  the  Far  Realm,  the  worlds  around  distant

starsare  more  dangerous.  Aboleths,  grell,  psurlons,  and

tsochari are particularly alien and incomprehensible.

make a variety of tactics viable, so multiple encounters with

monsters of the same race play and feel different. They have the

intelligence and insidiousness to contemplate campaign-span-

ning plots to destroy kingdoms, subvert good organizations, or

bring ruin and horror to the entire world. Finally, their goals

and desires are innately repulsive to humanoids of all sorts,

and heroes need little in the way of special motivation to take

up arms against them.

Creating a featured villain in your campaign is a powerful

way to build a central theme for the game. It provides continu-

ity from scenario to scenario and gives your players a clear

foe for their characters to strive against. A memorable villain

is an essential part of any D&D game, and few villains are as

memorable or as dangerous as a master aberration.

frightful pricea character who willingly  irts with madness,

or allows herself to be captured and experimented on by her

foes, or who abandons her moral and ethical anchors in order

to win the knowledge necessary.

The  adventure  begins  with  a  dif cult,  possibly  lethal,

encounter that shakes the players con dence in their char-

acters ability to meet the threat. It slowly becomes easier as

the characters acquire more information and understanding

of the enemy they face, but ultimately their preparations are

insuf cient in the face of the cosmic evil they have chosen to

oppose. The horri c adventure is a bleaker, more challenging

game in which characters die (or suffer other incapacitating

dooms)  more  frequently  than  they  do  in  conventionally

heroic games.

HEROIC VS. HORRIFIC ADVENTURE

The typical pacing of an adventure presumes that the threat

gradually gathers, and the heroes in turn  rst face relatively

simple challenges that grow more dangerous the deeper they

proceed  into  the  plot.  In  effect,  the  heroes  grow  to  meet

the  challenge,  and  by  the  time  they  confront  the  ultimate

encounter, they have been strengthened by their efforts. They

are more capable, more courageous, and hopefully equal to the

task of defeating the ultimate threat. In game terms, a heroic

adventure  built  around   ve  key  encounters  might  follow  a

progression like this:

First encounter

Second encounter

Third encounter

Fourth encounter

Fifth encounter

EL 1

EL +0

EL +0

EL +1

EL +3

Heroic adventures grow more challenging and offer a climactic

battle when the heroes are ready for it.

Aberration  adventures  are  not  heroic.  Instead,  they  are

horri c.  They  start  badly,  and  end  worse.  The  heroes   rst

encounter with their adversary teaches the heroes that they

are up against a threat that likely exceeds their capabilities.

Resolving a horri c adventure almost certainly requires ter-

rible sacri ce on the part of the heroes; the best they can hope

for is to return things to the way they were before. A horri c

adventure built around  ve key encounters follows a much

harder progression:

First encounter

Second encounter

Fourth encounter

Fifth encounter

COMPONENTS OF AN

ABERRATION CAMPAIGN

Not only does an aberration-centric campaign feel different

from  a  campaign  featuring  mundane  enemies,  it  also  plays

differently.  Aberration  races  include  extremely  powerful

individuals, creatures with access to mighty mental powers,

and creatures steeped in evil so relentless and sinister that

only the strongest and most courageous of characters can face

them without retreating.

Epic-Level Play

Terrible creatures rule over the aboleth and mind  ayer cities.

An aboleth savant-lord or mind  ayer elder brain is a foe that

only the most accomplished of characters can challenge with

any hope of survival. Moreover, master aberrations frequently

entertain plots and schemes of truly epic scale. These two facts

imply that aberration-focused campaigns eventually enter the

realm of epic-level play. Characters who have not yet achieved

epic levels themselves might  nd that they cannot defeat the

lurking cosmic evil at the root of their troubles, and must settle

for containing it as best they can.

Since  many  aberrations  are  quite  brilliant,  it  is  not  at  all

unusual for individuals to acquire class levels in psion, sorcerer,

wizard, or other classes. Such creatures with racial Hit Dice

and class levels can easily exceed 20 total Hit Dice and begin to

qualify for epic feats. For example, a 16th-level aboleth wizard

has 24 Hit Dice, and could reasonably select epic feats when

it reaches 21 and 24 HD. For that matter, some aberrations

might advance both by gaining more Hit Dice, as monsters

do, and adding class levels. A truly awful aboleth savant might

be a Gargantuan monster with 18 racial Hit Dice and  fteen

wizard levels.

The  parenthetical  Encounter  Levels  represent  the  differ-

ence  between  informed and  uninformed characters.  If  the

characters  take  steps  to  understand  their  foes  and  plumb

their  horrible  secrets,  they  have  an  easier  time  in  dealing

with them, at least at  rst. Comprehension should come at a

Aboleths  and  mind   ayers  are  renowned  for  their  psionic

might. While the spell-like psionics described in the Monster

Manual  certainly  permit  a  psionic  aberration  to  do  terrible

things to an unfortunate characters mind, you should consider

making  use  of  the  rules  presented  in  the  Expanded  Psionics

Handbook  if  you  intend  to  spotlight  a  psionic  aberration  in

your campaign.

Basing the mental powers of psionic aberrations on psi-like

abilities or psion levels rather than spell-like abilities or wiz-

ard levels adds a new dimension to your game. First of all, if

your players are not familiar with the psionic

rules, they will quickly realize that they

dont know what their enemies are truly

capable of. This is a desirable state of affairs in

an aberration-centric campaign, because

the players will naturally be at least a

little scared of the unknown. Increas-

ing your players sense of the threat

to  their  characters  and  reducing

their comfort level with the

perils they face goes a long

way  toward  transform-

ing your campaign into

a  darker,  more  alien

place.  Even  if  your

players  are  familiar

with  the  psionic  rules,

they will  nd that facing

foes  that  are  every  bit  as

psionically capable as they are

goes a long way toward leveling

the playing  eld between characters

and monsters.

Vile Darkness

Finally, master aberrations such as aboleths, mind  ayers, and

tsochari are capable of cold, dispassionate evil that humanoids

simply cannot comprehend. Mind  ayers rip the living brains

from their hapless captives and devour them; aboleths

transform heroes into gelatinous, mucus-

breathing slaves. These are not foes for

the faint of heart. They are hor-

rible, repellent, and positively

shocking  in  their  diver-

gence from any normal

standards of human

morals or behavior.

Some  powerful

aberrations  might

have knowledge of the

Dark  Speech,  or  wield

spells or items that deal

vile  damage,  or  coldly

in ict terrible tortures

on their captives. In addi-

tion, the deity known

as the Patient One

serves as patron

to  aberrations

that  lack  other

divine   gures.

MORE ABERRATIONS

Lords of Madness spotlights the most iconic and prevalent aber-

rations from the Monster Manual, plus a handful of notable ab-

errations from other sources. If you would like other aberration

choices, here are some interesting aberration races you might

want to feature in your own campaign.

Avolakia:  These  wormlike  creatures  possess  the  ability  to

assume humanoid form and use that power to lead adventurers

to terrible ends deep underground. They are potent necroman-

cers and guard their lairs with hordes of animated dead. Monster

Gibbering Orb: Sages speculate that the gibbering orbs are

progenitors  of  both  beholderkin  and  stranger  beasts  such  as

gibbering mouthers. These horrifyingly alien creatures wander

the planes in search of spellcasters to devour. Epic Level Hand-

book page 191.

Naga: Although they rarely gather in great numbers, nagas

charm  or  dominate  lesser  creatures  into  doing  their  bidding.

Some believe that nagas were bred thousands of years ago by

the  yuan-ti  as  sacred  animals  or  guardians.  Monster  Manual

ost  races  maintain  as  part  of  their  culture

elaborate creation myths, stories they pass down

through the generations with great respect, for

these myths tell of how their race came to be.

Often, one races creation myths are at odds with anothers,

but this is of little concern, since a con icting tale can easily

be discounted as sheer fabrication.

Not  all  races  have  creation  myths.  The  aboleths  do  not

share  myth-stories  for  a  simple  reason.  They  believe  it  an

indisputable fact that they were the  rst, the primal race that

existed before nearly all else, second only to the unknowable

Elder  Evils  that  spawned  them.  They  know  this  because

they remember the ancient past with crystal clarity. All else

in the world is a pale imitation of their primal perfection.

Even the deities themselves are subject to derision, for the

aboleths know that they predate the gods. They have seen the

world destroyed countless times by apocalypses both natural

and arti cial, yet each time the world remade itself and the

aboleths survived. They are truly nightmares out of time.

ABOLETH ANATOMY

Super cially, an aboleth resembles a  sh. Yet it takes only

a few moments of observation to realize that an aboleth is

something else entirelynot  sh, nor squid, nor boneless

deep-sea predator, but something that combines elements

of all three.

EXTERNAL ANATOMY

An average aboleth measures 20 feet long and weighs

6,500 pounds, although many live to grow much larger.

The largest aboleth encountered by reputable adventur-

ers measured just over 40 feet long, but certainly even

larger  specimens  lurk  in  the  deepest  reaches  of  the

unseen  realm.  Their  streamlined  shape  ef ciently

slithers through the primeval seas of the ancient past

as  well  as  through  the  contemporary  underground

seas that  ll the lower reaches of the world.

Perhaps the most distinctive of an aboleths features

are  its  four  tentacles.  Used  primarily  to  capture,

subdue, and transform prey and slaves, they serve the

creature as a means of locomotion when out of the

water. The powerful tentacles grab nearby surfaces

and literally drag the creatures writhing bulk along

behind. Each tentacle is little more than a power-

ful coil of muscles wrapped in a sheath of mucus

membrane. Down the length of each tentacle runs

a single primary slime duct (labeled 1 on  the diagram

on the next page) as well as countless capillary ducts

that transport the specialized slime created in its

15

milathast  (an  organ  described  in  Internal  Anatomy,  below)

to the tentacle surface. The creature uses this toxic slime to

transform captured victims into creatures more able to serve

in its watery lair.

An aboleth swims using powerful strokes of its tail while

holding  its  tentacles  up  against  the  side  of  its  body.  The

creature possesses numerous  ns to stabilize and guide its

motion. A swimming aboleth looks more like a snake than a

 sh, so sinuous and  uid is the motion of its tail and body.

The creatures mouth is a unique organ. When closed, little

is visible beyond a pale white pucker, no more than a few

inches across. It opens with shocking speed when the crea-

ture feeds. Fully opened, the mouth resembles an equilateral

triangle about 2 feet wide on a side. At each corner, a long,

thin stalk tipped with a bony spike (2) extends outward. The

inner walls of an aboleths mouth are studded with thousands

of tiny serrated teeth. The three bony stalks are used to col-

lect food and push it into the mouth, which then constricts

and shreds the food into easily swallowed ribbons. Despite

its fantastic amount of teeth, an aboleth has no natural bite

attack;  its  feeding  mandibles  and  teeth  are  too  small  and

weak to be used in combat.

Along the creatures  anks run twin sets of large ori ces (3),

each of which can open as wide as 2 feet. Most aboleths have

two ori ces on each  ank, but a particularly well-endowed

specimen can have up to seven on a side. On a more natural

creature, they might be called nostrils. An aboleth uses these

vents to breathe, scent, speak, and expel mucus into the sur-

rounding area. On land, this mucus provides a slimy bed of

ooze that allows the creature to slither about more easily. In

water, the mucus transforms the liquid around the creature

into a cloud of soupy slime. In either environment, an aboleth

breathes the mucus in order to survive; an aboleth that some-

how loses the ability to create the slime quickly suffocates,

even underwater.

An aboleths senses are roughly equal to that of a humans,

with the exception of its eyesight. An aboleths three eyes see as

well as a humans in bright light, but in complete darkness they

give the creature darkvision out to 60 feet. All three eyes appear

as little more than large, red ovals; no iris or pupil is visible.

An aboleth detects scents via its ventral ori ces, as mentioned

above, and detects sound by feeling the vibrations in the air or

water upon its skin; in effect, the creatures skin acts as a huge

eardrum. Aboleths lack tongues, but the walls of their mouths

The aboleth revealed (numbers keyed to text references)

have a highly developed sense of taste nonetheless. The most

sensitive parts of an aboleths body are its tentacles and the tip

of its tail (where its reproductive organs are located).

Skin

An aboleths hide is actually a thick layer of multiple mem-

branes  too  solid  to  be  called  mucus  and  too  runny  to  be

called skin. The membrane layer acts like soggy rubber when

manipulated,  capable of stretching out to great lengths but

returning to its original shape when released. The material

is far tougher than skin and is quite dif cult to cut or pierce,

affording  excellent  natural  armor  when  buttressed  by  the

creatures skeleton. To casual observation, the membranous

skin  seems  to  be  a  dark,  nauseating  green,  but  on  closer

inspection, a rainbow of faint colors can be seen dancing across

and under its surface. These  ashes of prismatic light are no

mere  gments; they are the latent energies the creature uses

to manifest its amazing psionic powers.

When  the  layer  of  membranes  dries,  it  becomes  rough,

leathery,  and  completely  waterproof.  This  seals  essential

moisture inside the aboleth but the drying process is excru-

ciatingly painful and debilitating to the creature. An aboleths

membranes dry quite rapidly once the creature is out of water;

under such conditions, it takes 2 points of Dexterity damage

per hour (to a minimum Dexterity of 1). This damage can be

cured  by  magic  or  by  immersion  in  water  (which  cures  all

damage and rehydrates the membranes at the rate of 2 points

of Dexterity per minute).

An aboleth whose membranes remain dry does not die. It

merely enters a state of suspended animation similar to sleep,

except that the creature remains aware of its surroundings. It

can hear and see, but cannot detect odors or feel tactile sensa-

tions. The creatures natural armor gains a bonus of +6 (which

offsets the loss of Dexterity), and it gains damage reduction

5/adamantine. It retains the ability to think and observe, but

it can take no actions, not even purely mental actions. Inside,

it remains moist and functional; an aboleth in this state that

is badly cut or pierced leaks and quickly bleeds to death. Left

undisturbed, though, it can remain in this state forever. This

is known to aboleths as the long dreaming and is considered

a fate far worse than death.

INTERNAL ANATOMY

Unlike other aberrations, an aboleths internal organs are fairly

analogous to those found in more natural creaturesin their

case,   sh.  Despite  these  similarities,  certain  aspects  of  the

aboleths innards defy logic and explanation.

Skeletal System

The creatures skeletal system is perhaps the simplest of its

internal organs. Fully a third of the creatures skeleton consists

of its massive skull, a huge shape that extends from the front

where its three jawbones (which allow for its triangular mouth)

come together down to the midpoint of its back. Extending

back from the skull is the spinal cord, a wide set of interlocking

bones with incredible  exibility; an aboleth can coil up like a

snake if it wishes. Descending from either side are numerous

long ribs, each independently articulated and connected on the

beasts underside to a large,  at bone that protects its stomach

and other internal organs from attacks and damage. The ribs

vanish as the tail begins. The tail is supported by a long exten-

sion of the spinal cord. The creatures  ns contain no bones

and are supported by thick sets of cartilaginous spines.

Digestive System

An aboleths digestive system is straightforward as well, consist-

ing of a mouth, an esophagus, a particularly large stomach, and

coils of intestines. The creatures teeth are small but numerous,

and  they  extend  all  the  way  down  its  esophagus  (4)  to  the

stomach (5). An aboleth takes several minutes to swallow food,

and such morsels are slashed and torn by the tiny teeth the

entire way. Food reaches the stomach as a slurry.

The  stomach  breaks  the  food  down  further  and  siphons

off  a  certain  portion  to  a  long,   at  organ  wedged  between

the stomach and the lower ribcage. This organ is part of the

respiratory  system  and  is  known  as  the  milathast  (6).  The

actual process of extracting nutrition from food occurs in an

aboleths intestines (7). The creature can digest  esh, bone, and

vegetable matter with equal ease; other materials are either not

swallowed in the  rst place or passed through the intestinal

tract with great pain.

Respiratory System

While it is commonly believed that aboleths breathe water,

they do not. They possess neither lungs nor gills, yet they still

must process something to provide their blood and bodies with

energy. Whatever it is that aboleths breathe, it is found only in

the clear, runny mucus that they constantly produce.

This  mucus  is  generated  in  the  creatures  milathast,  the

closest organ an aboleth has to a lung. The milathast draws

in water from the numerous ventral ori ces on the creatures

body,  mixes  it  with  material  siphoned  from  the  creatures

stomach, and squirts the resulting mess back outside the body,

where it interacts with the surrounding water to create a thick

cloud of mucus that the creature can then breathe.

An  organ  similar  to  the  milathast  is  located  above  the

creatures stomach, nestled between its two hearts. This organ,

the nilthast (8), converts liquid mucus into a foul-smelling gas.

By regulating the amount of mucus and gas in this bladder-

like organ, an aboleth can quickly gain or lose buoyancy, and

thus more easily navigate vertical changes in direction while

swimming. The gases generated here are also used to assist

respiration when the monster is not in water.

Circulatory System

The most interesting aspect of an aboleths circulatory system

is that it has two hearts. The primary heart (9) is located just

above the intestines in the creatures lower back. This organ

The most highly developed of an aboleths organs is its cen-

tral nervous systemin particular, its brain. An aboleths

brain is a massive structure that accounts for nearly one- fth

of the creatures body mass. The brain is various shades of

purple and looks somewhat similar in shape to an aboleth

without its long tail.

The brain consists of  ve major sections, each of which

is discussed below.

Frontal  Lobe  (1):  Located  at  the  front  of  the  brain,

this  cone-shaped  lobe  is  pale  purple  and  covered  with

thousands  of  tiny,  hornlike  protrusions.  This  lobe  has

two  primary  functions.  First,  it  generates  an  aboleths

powerful enslaving mental attack. Second, it functions as

a telepathic core that enables the creature to converse with

its enslaved minions, while preventing the minions from

sensing anything in the aboleths mind but its unyielding

domination and control.

Primary Lobe (2): The primary lobe is located directly

behind the frontal lobe and above the ventral lobe. It is

here  that  an  aboleths  primary  brain  functions  occur:

thought, logic, intelligence, reason, and everything else

that brains make possible in other creatures. The creatures

three optic nerves attach to this portion of the brain.

Ventral Lobe (3): Although the ventral lobe looks like

four  separate  tentacle-shaped  lobes  radiating  out  from

below the primary lobe, it is in fact a single lobe, connected

on the underside of the brain. The four arms of the lobe are

striped with alternating bands of dark and light purple, and

they store the memories an aboleth has created for itself and

the racial memories it gained at birth. These arms continue

to grow as an aboleth ages, and in the eldest savants, the arms

of the ventral lobe can reach all the way back to the base of

the tail. Where these arms extend out of the skull, they are

surrounded by a tough but  exible sheath of tissue. The lobe

itself is nearly as strong as bone while remaining as  exible

as the creatures tentacles.

Dorsal Lobe (4): While the ventral lobe might be the largest

portion of an aboleths brain, the dorsal lobe is easily the most

visually stunning. Located behind the primary lobe, it consists

of a writhing mass of purple tendrils with tips that  ash and

pulse with multicolored light. The light arcs and dances from

one tendril to the other, representing the vast stores of psionic

and magical energy at an aboleths command. This energy is

apparently generated by the dorsal lobe and focused by the

primary lobe to create the numerous illusions that aboleths

are notorious for using.

Rear Lobe (5): This is the smallest lobe, consisting of six

long, tendril-shaped extensions connected to a central spheri-

cal hub at the farthest section of the dorsal lobe. This portion

of the brain takes care of the bodys autonomic functions, such

as breathing, circulation, digestion, and the like.

A typical aboleth brain (numbers keyed to text references)

pumps blood throughout the body and maintains blood pres-

sure, just as a normal heart does. This heart is connected to

the secondary heart (10) via a large artery and a large vein; the

artery passes through the creatures nilthast, where it meets

the respiratory system. The second heart provides blood to the

aboleths immense brain and seems to vitalize the blood with

a mysterious chemical or enzyme that only the brain needs.

Aboleth blood comes in two colors; the blood that fuels its body

is bright red, while the blood that  ows from the secondary

heart to the brain is deep purple, almost black, in color.

Reproductive System

Aboleths have both male and female reproductive organs. To an

aboleth, reproduction is a deeply personal process that should

happen in isolation. An aboleth is typically seized with the

urge to lay eggs once every  ve years, at which time it retreats

to an area of solitude. It lays 1d3 eggs at a time, quickly encases

the eggs in mucus, and fertilizes the surrounding water with

a jet of  uid emitted from between the  ukes of its tail. This

 uid clings to the mucus, seeping into it and fertilizing the

eggs within while making the entire mass fairly cohesive and

solid as a whole. An aboleth usually cements the egg mass to a

stone wall or  oor, but if none are available, it allows the egg

mass to  oat free in the water.

AN ABOLETHS MIND

Those who have had mental contact with an aboleths mind tell

of a powerful and alien intellect both vast in size and horrifying

in scope. If a humans mind can be said to be analogous to a

river, traveling through diverse lands and touching numerous

points of the world, then an aboleths mind is the oceana

vast, seemingly endless primal source into which all rivers

must eventually pour.

Most  amazing  is  an  aboleths  vast  racial  memory.  While

one  aboleth  has  no  direct  access  to  the  personal  memories

of any other, its own memories are handed down completely

intact through the generations. A pair of aboleths can easily

determine how they are related if they examine their memories

far enough into the past.

Aboleth memories are legion and predate those of all other

races. Mere access to such a vast wealth of memories would

quickly  and  irrevocably  drive  human  minds  insane,  but

aboleths do not have human minds. It takes time for them

to retrieve speci c bits of information from their memories;

aboleths take great enjoyment from simply wading through

their racial memories and can spend years observing just the

memories of one or two ancestors.

Scholars and clerics  nd it profoundly disturbing that these

memories  extend  back  further  than  most  creation  myths.

They  argue  that  the  so-called  memories  are  nothing  more

than  aboleth  lies,  or  an  exaggeration  spread  by  humanoids

who cant fully understand the aberrant mind. The aboleths

themselves  dont   aunt  their  racial  memories,  which  some

observers interpret as evidence that such memories do exist.

In any case, it is indisputable that the aboleths as a race are old

beyond reckoning.

ABOLETH LIFE

Aboleths  are  born  completely  cognizant  and  mature,  their

minds  instantly  absorbing  and  assimilating  the  knowledge

and memories of their parent. They do not go through any

period of childhood per se, but they are still physically quite

weak and helpless for several years after hatching. As it grows, a

young aboleth remains close to its parent for approximately ten

years, obeying the parent completely and without question for

pqqqqqqqqqrs

ABOLETH BITES

Although  an  aboleths  mouth  is  relatively  small,  it  can  still

deliver a nasty bite. An aboleths bite attack is considered an

unarmed strike, not a natural attack, and without the Improved

Unarmed Strike feat, it provokes attacks of opportunity. Like-

wise, the act of extruding its feeding stalks and rearing back to

bite is a clumsy move for most aboleths, so a bite attack is a

full-round action. An aboleth cant attack with its tentacles at

the same time as it bites.

On  a  successful  hit,  an  aboleths  bite  deals  1d4  points  of

damage, plus half its Strength bonus.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

this period. After reaching maturity at age ten, a fully grown

aboleth  has   nally  developed  all  of  its  psionic  powers  and

enslave abilities, and is ready to head off on its own.

Aboleths continue to grow in size, albeit at a much slower

rate,  as  they  age.  This  growth  continues  until  the  creature

reaches a Gargantuan size and a length of about 40 feet. Tech-

nically,  the  creature  keeps  growing  after  this  point,  but  its

physical growth slows to such an extent that it can be measured

only on a geologic scale.

Nevertheless, it is distinctly possible that larger aboleths

with far more than 24 racial Hit Dice exist, since barring death

from disease or violence, aboleths are effectively immortal.

Their minds and bodies remain as completely formed at age

ten as they are at age ten thousand and beyond. For this reason,

they do not gain penalties or bonuses to their ability scores

as they age; all that expands in aboleths minds as they grow

older are their memories.

Aboleths, as a rule, are not religious. They distinctly remem-

ber life before the arrival of the deities and feel no need to

prostrate themselves before creatures that are relatively new to

the world, no matter how admittedly powerful such creatures

might be. As a result, aboleths have no real concept of anything

like an afterlife, and thus have no rituals for the dead. Aboleths

believe that any of their fellows that die committed some kind

of error that led to their demise. At best, they are considered

sustenance to feed upon, and at worst, a rotting testimony to

failure, barely worthy of the energy it takes to dispose of the

carcass.  A  dead  aboleth  is  left  for  the  creatures  minions  to

handle; aboleths have no graveyards, for to build a graveyard

is to admit mortality.

THE ABOLETH DIET

Although aboleths can subsist by  ltering microscopic organ-

isms out of the surrounding water, they view this practice as

something done in desperation only. Aboleths are carnivorous

and enjoy feeding on a wide variety of  esh. They are fond

of  sh, squid, octopus, whale, and jelly sh, but their favorite

foods  are  those  found  only  on  land.  The   esh  of  human-

oidsespecially that of humans and gnomes (svirfneblin in

particular)is considered a delicacy. Aboleths  nd the  esh

of creatures transformed by their tentacle slime to be the most

delectable and easy to digest, so they take pains to make sure

food is properly seasoned before feeding.

Despite its great size, an aboleth need not eat much to subsist.

Its stomach and intestines are so fantastically ef cient that a

typical Medium creature can nourish an aboleth for a month.

Aboleths might brand their slaves by eating nonessential por-

tions of them, or simply select their least ef cient slave when

its time for a meal.

As an unusual aspect of an aboleths dietary process, it gains

 ashes of memory and emotion from the body of the creature

being eaten. These  ashes come at random times and are little

more than partial memories or powerful emotions. An aboleth

regards them as the height of the culinary experience.

ABOLETH VARIANTS

Although the aboleths have existed for untold eons, the shape

and function of their bodies has not evolved as much as one

would suspect over time. This might be due to the fact that

their racial memories somehow serve to stagnate their develop-

ment by encouraging them to conform to the past. Or it might

be simply that their current form represents the pinnacle of

perfection for their kind, and that any further adaptation or

evolution would be nothing more than regression.

Yet a few alternative forms of aboleths exist, having arisen

as the creatures expanded into new terrains and were forced

to change as a result. For the most part, these variant aboleths

are statistically quite similar to the standard aboleth presented

in the Monster Manual; changes are indicated in the paragraphs

that follow.

Amphibious Aboleth: Aboleths spend

their entire lives underwater. They have little

interest  in  exploring  the

surface world to any great

extent; thats what slaves

are  for.  Yet  some  aboleths,

in the high clouds alone with their unknowable thoughts, and

they seldom take slaves. The creatures dwell miles above the

ground, rarely at an altitude of less than 3 miles and usually

at a height of 3 to 6 miles. They make their homes inside vast,

perpetual clouds  lled with dense moisture and maintained

by their ancient magic. How the uobilyths came to dwell in

the distant reaches of the skies is unknown, but it likely has

something to do with their intrinsic rejection of the traditions

of aboleth history and society.

Stygian Aboleth: Eons ago, a large city of exceptionally

gargantuan aboleths managed an amazing feat of magic and

transported an entire world of slaves and minions from the

Material Plane to the Nine Hells; they arrived on the layer

known as Stygia and  ourished. Since that time, the in u-

ence of the Nine Hells has changed these aboleths, infusing

them with the frozen evil magic of Stygia and creating

an entirely new species. These Stygian aboleths rule

nations of aquatic baatezu and slaves culled from

countless worlds and planes. In time, these

aboleths  might  transform  fully  into  a

new  kind  of  devil,  but  until  then

particularly those that

become stranded after

caverns  collapse  be-

hind them or that are

forced to  ee their home

city  for  some  reason,  must

dwell  in  areas  that  arent  ideal

for  their  physiology.  Aboleths

trapped  in  dry  areas  quickly  succumb

to the long dreaming, but those stuck in areas with at least

some water, such as in a large swamp or fen, can adapt over

time. These amphibious aboleths are identical to their aquatic

kin, except that their land speed increases to 20 feet, their

swim speed decreases to 40 feet, and they gain the amphib-

ious special quality (meaning they can breathe air as well

as water). They can survive inde nitely on land, and they

dry out and succumb to the long dreaming only if they take

enough  nonlethal  damage  from  thirst  or  starvation  to  be

rendered unconscious.

Uobilyth (Aerial Aboleth): The most exotic and unusual

aboleth  variant  is  the  reclusive  uobilyth  or  aerial  aboleth,

as they are known to the few who have encountered them.

An uobilyth looks similar to an aboleth in shape except that

its tail has no  ukes and its coloration is a deeper green-blue.

Uobilyths do not have the aquatic subtype or a swim speed.

They gain the air subtype and a  y speed of 60 feet (good). An

uobilyths ability to  y is a supernatural ability.

Uobilyths are never lawfully aligned; most are neutral evil or

even chaotic evil. Solitary creatures, they are content to dwell

Orluthian,

a stygian aboleth

the  average  Stygian

aboleth  is  similar  to  an

advanced   endish  aboleth  in  capabilities  and  statistics.  A

sample Stygian aboleth is described below.

Orluthian, Stygian Aboleth

Orluthian rules a small city of  endish skum built into the

underside of an iceberg located in a remote corner of Stygia.

There, it plots the construction of specialized vortex portals

that can reach across the dimensions to manifest in Material

Plane oceans. It is from the ships and victims pulled through

these  vortices  that  Orluthian  gathers  the  raw  materials  it

needs to further its experiments to learn why humanoids are

suddenly so common among the worlds.

SAVANT ABOLETH PRESTIGE CLASS

Aboleths  are  powerfully  strong  creatures,  but  they  do  not

value  physical  strength  in  their  leaders.  Rather,  they  look

to the eldest, the most intelligent, the wisest, and the most

forceful of personality to lead them. In short, they look to the

savant aboleths.

Savant aboleths are highly arrogant creatures. They organize

and run aboleth society, rarely leaving the boundaries of their

chosen city except to trade information or to train a new savant

in the ways of the glyph. Savants lust for magical lore and bend

all of their citys resources to the acquisition of new magicin

particular, the capture of new slaves with the ability to cast

arcane spells.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  savant  aboleth

prestige class.

Spellcasting: At each level, a savant aboleth gains new spells

per day as if it had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting

class it belonged to before adding the prestige class. It does not,

however, gain any other bene t a character of that class would

have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcast-

ing. If an aboleth had more than one arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a savant, it must decide to which class it adds

the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Glyph  Mastery  (Sp):  At  1st  level,  a  savant  aboleth  has

mastered the ancient craft of the aboleth glyph. When a savant

aboleth creates an aboleth glyph, multiply the base cost of the

glyph by 75% to determine its cost in XP and raw materials.

Additionally, a savant aboleth gains the ability to cast glyph

of warding as a spell-like ability a number of times each day

equal  to  its  savant  aboleth  level.  Each  use  of  this  spell-like

ability costs 200 gp in raw materials (rare inks, crushed shells,

and powdered gemstones). Alternatively, a savant aboleth can

expend 8 XP instead of spending the 200 gp.

Although this ability mimics a divine spell, this spell-like

ability uses arcane magic.

Ossi  cation (Ex): As a savant aboleth grows more power-

ful, its body begins to transform and become more heavily

armored. Ridges of bone form atop its skull and run down its

spine, eventually encasing the savant aboleths brain and back

in thick natural armor. A savant aboleths natural armor bonus

improves by 2 points at 1st level, 3rd level, and 5th level.

Enlarged Enslave (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, the range

of a savant aboleths enslave special attack is doubled from 30

feet to 60 feet.

Recrudescent  Memories  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  a  savant

aboleths  memories  surface  in  a  sudden  blast  of  forgotten

and hidden knowledge. The memories quickly return to the

hidden depths of the aboleths mind, but the  ash of insight

is enough to infuse the creatures mind with a powerful rush

of  inspiration  and  spontaneous  evolution.  The  aboleth  can

increase  its  Intelligence,  Wisdom,  or  Charisma  score  by  2

points. This is a permanent, untyped bonus, similar to those

gained by advancing four character levels.

At 4th level, a savant aboleths memories  are again, and it

can increase its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by

2 points.

Greater Glyph (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, a savant aboleths

glyph of warding spell-like ability improves and becomes a greater

glyph of warding spell-like ability. It must expend raw materials

worth 400 gp (or 16 XP) each time it uses this spell-like ability.

A savant aboleth can voluntarily underpower this spell-like

ability to cast a glyph of warding instead.

True Enslave (Su): Beginning at 4th level, a savant aboleths

enslave ability grows much more powerful. An enslaved crea-

ture can no longer make a new Will saving throw each day to

break free from the enslavement; the condition is permanent

until  successfully  dispelled.  Additionally,  the  enslavement

lasts no matter how far the savant aboleth moves from its slave.

Slaves  on  a  different  plane  remain  enslaved,  but  the savant

aboleth cannot communicate with them telepathically until

they return to the same plane.

Elder  Glyph  (Sp):  At  5th  level,  a  savant  aboleths  greater

glyph of warding spell-like ability improves and becomes an elder

glyph of warding spell-like ability (see below). It must expend

raw materials worth 1,000 gp (or 40 XP) each time it uses this

spell-like ability. A savant aboleth can voluntarily underpower

this spell-like ability to duplicate either a glyph of warding or a

greater glyph of warding instead.

glyph automatically reappears 1 minute after it is discharged.

Similarly, if the glyph is dispelled, it reforms as good as new

1 minute later. An aboleth glyph can be destroyed only in

the same manner that a magic item can be destroyedMor-

denkainens disjunction, physical destruction of the glyph, and

so on.

Alternatively, the aboleth can create a master glyph. Each

master glyph is a unique glyph with speci c effects and base

costs; several sample master glyphs are detailed later in this

chapter.

Death Frenzy

When an aboleth takes this feat, its sense of immortality rebels

against the very concept of death. If threatened with death,

the creature becomes frenzied with speed and fury.

Prerequisites: Aboleth, Diehard, Endurance.

Bene  t: If the aboleth is reduced to fewer hit points than its

total Hit Dice, it automatically enters a death frenzy. Entering

this state is an immediate action; the aboleth can enter a death

frenzy even when its not its turn. While in a death frenzy,

the aboleth cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or use

supernatural special attacks.

When an aboleth enters a death frenzy, it gains a +4 morale

bonus to its Strength and Dexterity, and the threat range for

all its natural attacks doubles. When it makes a full attack, it

can make one additional attack each round at its highest base

attack bonus. Its land speed increases by 10 feet, and its swim

speed increases by 20 feet. Finally, it gains fast healing 2.

A death frenzy lasts until the creature is killed or until its

hit points rise enough to equal or exceed its total number of

Hit Dice. Upon emerging from a death frenzy, the creature

immediately takes 1d4 points of Strength damage.

ABOLETH FEATS

Enlarge Mucus Cloud

Although aboleths have no doubt discovered and developed

countless specialized and unique feats during their millions

of years of existence in the sunken realms of the world, those

aboleths that come into contact with other races favor a fairly

small number of unique feats. These feats are detailed below.

An aboleth with this feat can extend its mucus cloud into a

wider area.

Prerequisites: Aboleth, Con 20.

Bene  t: The aboleths mucus cloud extends to  ll an area

equal to its natural reach (a 10-foot radius for most aboleths).

Normal: The aboleths mucus cloud has a radius of only 1

Craft Aboleth Glyph [Item Creation]

foot.

An aboleth with this feat can create magic glyphs that store

spells or have specialized effects of their own.

Prerequisites: Aboleth, caster level 5th.

Bene  t: The creature can create a permanent glyph of ward-

ing effect that automatically recharges and replenishes its own

energy after a short period of inactivity after it is triggered.

Crafting an aboleth glyph takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its

base price. The base price of an aboleth glyph is its caster level

 spell level  1,000 gp. To create the glyph, the creature must

spend 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials

costing one-half of the base price.

A newly created glyph functions exactly as if the creature

had cast glyph of warding on the affected area, except that the

Special:  On  land,  the  aboleths  mucus  cloud  becomes  a

mucus puddle of an equal radius. The mucus can affect other

beings in contact with the puddle (including any that move

through it using their base land speed), but beings that jump

or  y over it, or otherwise avoid the puddle, are safe.

Memory Eater

An aboleth with this feat is particularly adept at extracting

memories  and  knowledge  from  the  bodies  of  those  it  con-

sumes.

Prerequisites: Aboleth, Cha 21.

Bene  t: The aboleth processes and remembers countless

memories of those it has eaten. It can make untrained skill

and that normally cannot be used untrained.

Normal: Aboleths receive only random  ashes of memory

that  quickly  fade  while  eating  the   esh  of  an  intelligent

creature.

Powerful Bite

Glyph of slaves glory

An aboleth with this feat develops jaws that are much more

muscular than normal, allowing it to bite more ef ciently.

Prerequisites: Aboleth, Str 28, Weapon Focus (bite).

Bene  t:  An  aboleth

with this feat gains a nat-

ural bite attack that deals

2d6  points  of  damage

plus  half  its  Strength

modi er. If the aboleth

makes a full attack, this

bite attack is a second-

ary  attack  and  is  made

with a 5 penalty on the

attack roll.

Normal: The aboleths

bite attack is an unarmed

strike  that  takes  a  full-

round  action  to  use

and deals 1d4 points of

damage on a hit.

Quickslime

The  slime  attack  of  an

aboleth  with  this  feat

is  particularly  fast  and

dif cult to resist.

Prerequisites:

Aboleth,  Ability  Focus

(slime).

Bene  t: The save DC

of  the  creatures  slime

attack gains a +2 bonus;

this  stacks  with  the

bonus  granted  by  the

Ability Focus (slime) feat. Further, the transformation process

takes only 1d4+1 rounds to affect the victims skin.

Glyph of the deep

Normal: The transformation process takes 1d4+1 minutes.

Reach Bite

An aboleth with this feat can extend its jaws and esophagus out

from its body to make attacks beyond its normal reach.

Prerequisites:  Aboleth,  Str  28,  Powerful  Bite,  Weapon

Focus (bite).

Bene  t: The creatures reach with its bite attack extends by

an additional 5 feet.

Normal: The creatures bite attack has a reach equal to its

standard reach (10 feet for most aboleths).

Thicken Mucus

An aboleth with this feat can produce mucus that is thicker

than  normal,  and  other  creatures   nd  it  dif cult  to  swim

through.

Prerequisites: Aboleth, Con 22, Enlarge Mucus Cloud.

Bene  t: Creatures within range of the mucus cloud have

their swim speed reduced by half if they start their movement

in  the  cloud.  Additionally,  all  creatures  in  melee  with  this

aboleth take a 1 penalty on attack rolls, Armor Class, and

Re ex saving throws.

Glyph of law

Aboleths,  skum,  and

creatures  transformed

by  an  aboleths  slime

attack  are  unaffected  by

Thicken  Mucus  and  can

move  through  the  cloud

without penalty.

Special: When on land,

this  ability  affects  only

nonaboleth (or nontrans-

formed  creatures)  that

walk through the mucus

puddle. The land speed of

these creatures is reduced

by  half,  and  their  swim

speed  is  not  affected.

Flying  creatures  are  not

affected.

Freedom  of  movement

negates these penalties.

Toxic Mucus

An aboleth with this feat

can  produce  mucus  that

is  poisonous  to  other

creatures.

Prerequisites:  Abo-

leth,  Con  22,  Enlarge

Glyph of the slime curse

Bene  t:  Any  creature

that  comes  in  contact  with  the  mucus  cloud  becomes

poisoned.  The  creature  must  make  a  successful  Fortitude

save (DC 10 + half the aboleths Hit Dice + Con modi er) or

take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the

creature must save again against the same DC or take another

1d4 points of Dexterity damage. Creatures that remain in the

mucus cloud for multiple rounds must make additional saving

throws each round.

Aboleths, skum, and creatures transformed by an aboleths

slime attack are immune to the effect of Toxic Mucus and can

move through the cloud without penalty.

Special: When on land, this ability affects only nonaboleth

(or nontransformed creatures) that walk through the mucus

puddle;  ying creatures are not affected.

An aboleth must replenish its mucus constantly to maintain

the poisonous qualities. Samples taken from the aboleth retain

their toxic qualities for only 1 minute.

self-defeating. Armor is thought of as something that lesser

races  wear  in  a  futile  attempt  to  protect  themselves  from  a

dangerous world in which they should not rightfully exist.

Due  to  their  unusual  anatomy,  aboleths  use  magic  items

differently than humanoid-shaped creatures do. An aboleth

can wear:

ABOLETH MAGIC

Aboleths constantly search for new magic items,  nding them

to be among the few objects that lesser races are any good at

producing. An aboleth that enslaves a spellcasting creature

that has Item Creation feats  nds itself the owner of a potent

commodity. A slave who can create new magic items is perhaps

the most valued of resources in an aboleth city and is rented

out  to  other  aboleths  for  extensive  payments  of  additional

slaves or favors.

Aside  from  specialized  glyphs,  aboleth  spellcasters  also

spend  their  resources  on  creating  new  magic  items  for

themselves. Although only a rare few aboleths take levels in

divine spellcasting classes, they have no compunction against

utilizing magic items created by divine magic.

An aboleths tentacles can wield objects like wands, staffs,

rods, and other held magic items. An aboleth can even wield

magic  weapons,  although  most  prefer  to  use  their  tentacle

attacks in combat because they are not naturally pro cient

with any form of weapon. Additionally, an aboleth that wields

a weapon in one tentacle must make any other tentacle attacks

as secondary attacks (at the standard 5 penalty). It can wield

multiple weapons in its tentacles if it takes the Multiweapon

Fighting feat; otherwise, the penalties it suffers for using more

than one weapon are severe.

Although an aboleth could theoretically wear armor, the

armor  would  have  to  be  sized  and  built  to  conform  to  the

creatures body shape. Additionally, the fact that armor check

penalties  count  double  against  Swim  checks  means  that

aboleths   nd  the  prospect  of  wearing  armor  illogical  and

One headband or phylactery on a tentacle.

One pair of eye lenses or goggles on or over one eye. Because

aboleth eyes are considerably larger than human eyes, one

eye can hold both lenses of a pair without having to stack

them.

One belt, cloak, cape, or mantle about the tail just behind

the  ukes.

One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab

embedded in the slimy  esh on top of its head.

Two pairs of bracers or bracelets on two pairs of tentacles.

Up to three rings on the ends of its tentacles.

Aboleths cannot wear hats, helmets, vests, vestments, shirts,

robes, gloves, gauntlets, boots, or shoes.

MASTER GLYPHS

Aboleths that learn the Craft Aboleth Glyph feat can use their

knowledge of magic to create powerful magic glyphs. Most of

these glyphs merely duplicate the effect of a glyph of warding

spell. Aboleths that have the knowledge and power can learn

to craft much more potent, powerful glyphs known as master

glyphs.  Each  master  glyph  is  a  unique  glyph  with  speci c

effects. Several sample master glyphs are detailed here; you

can use these master glyphs as guidelines for creating new

master glyphs.

Master glyphs affect a creature upon its initial entry into the

glyphs range. Bene cial glyphs apply their effects immediately.

Hostile  glyphs  typically  grant  a  saving  throw  to  negate  or

reduce their effects; in this case, a creature need only make the

save upon entering the glyphs range. The effect of a glyph ends

PSIONIC ABOLETHS

This chapter assumes that you utilize the version of the aboleth

from  the  Monster  Manual.  If  you  have  the  Expanded  Psionics

Handbook, you should instead use the psionic aboleth variant

detailed there. This version of the aboleth is identical to the one

presented in the Monster Manual, except that it does not pos-

sess the same spell-like abilities or the enslave ability. It instead

possesses  a  large  array  of  similar  psi-like  abilities,  including

psionic dominate.

A savant aboleth does not gain new spells per day as it gains

levels. Instead, it gains increased power points and access to

new powers as if it had gained a level in whatever manifesting

class it belonged to before it added the prestige class.

A savant aboleths spell-like ability to cast the various glyph

spells is now a psi-like ability that duplicates the effect of the

spell in question.

A 2nd-level savant aboleths psionic dominate psi-like ability

is now enhanced as if by the Enlarge Power metapsionic feat

for free; the savant need not expend its psionic focus to use the

Enlarged psionic dominate psi-like ability.

The  Craft  Aboleth  Glyph  feat  requires  the  aboleth  to  be  at

least a 5th-level manifester rather than a 5th-level spellcaster.

Likewise, the glyphs created by this feat are considered to be

psionic  in  nature,  not  arcane  magic;  this  includes  all  master

glyphs.

If  you  wish  to  use  psionic  aboleths  in  your  campaign,  you

can do so with a few adjustments to the rules in this chapter. In

particular, you should make the following minor adjustments to

the new rules introduced in this book:

The savant aboleth monster prestige class no longer has an

entry  requirement  of  ability  to  cast  3rd-level  arcane  spells.

Rather, it must be able to manifest 3rd-level psionic powers as

a psion or wilder.

immediately after a creature leaves the glyphs area of effect,

but the creature must make a new saving throw immediately

upon reentering the glyphs range.

The effects of multiple master glyphs do not stack. In a case

where more than one master glyph would have an effect on

a speci c area, the master glyph with the highest caster level

suppresses the other glyphs. In the case of multiple glyphs of

the same caster level overlapping, the most recently created

glyph suppresses the older glyphs. A master glyph always sup-

presses the effect of a glyph of warding, greater glyph of warding,

or elder glyph of warding.

Glyph  of  the  Deep:  Any  air-breathing  creature  that

approaches within 20 feet of this glyph must make a DC 19

Fortitude save to avoid having its lungs instantly  ll with water.

A creature whose lungs  ll with water immediately begins to

drown. On the  rst round, its hit points drop to 0, and it falls

unconscious. On the following round, its hit points drop to

1, and on the third round, it dies. Any effect that returns a

drowning character to positive hit points wakens the creature

and allows it to cough up the water in its lungs. Otherwise,

only a DC 15 Heal check can empty the creatures lungs of

water and save it from a watery death.

THE NIGHTMARE

OUT OF TIME

Aboleths  are  characterized  by  their  ancient  nature.  They

remember the rise and fall of countless nations, the foundation

of the  rst religions, the formation of mountain ranges, and

the creation of the seas themselves. They have had more time

to build their empires than any other race; these empires rise

and fall on a geologic scale through the eons. They are primal

forces, unknowable to anything but their own kind.

There can be no accounting of the history of the aboleth

race. The creatures have existed for millions of years, and any

chronicle  of  their  history  with  even  a  small  level  of  detail

would  require  a  tome  thousands  of  pages  in  length.  Still,

despite  its  age,  the  aboleth  race  follows  certain  inexorable

trends,  just  as  the  life  and  death  of  mountains  and oceans

follows a cyclic path.

To  understand  the  source  of  the  aboleth  race,  one  must

 rst realize that other entities existed long before even the

aboleths themselves. Their goals and desires were alien and

unknowable to humankind. Yet they did exist, in the spaces

between reality and possibility. Modern sages theorize that

these creatures might be the primal source of the dimension

known as the Far Realm, while others argue that their presence

only enabled the existence of this dimension, and that the Far

Realm is but one of a myriad of their workings. Sages refer to

these beings collectively as the Elder Evils.

One of the Elder Evils was the source of the aboleth race.

The aboleths know this entity by the name Piscaethces, which

roughly translates as Blood Queen, for it is from her blood

that the primal aboleth was spawned. Piscaethces has since

retreated from the physical world, and although insane cultists

periodically attempt to call the Blood Queen back, she never

stays for long. Her interests lie beyond this dimension. The

aboleths themselves understand this, and they know that the

Blood Queen didnt spawn them out of scienti c curiosity or a

need for companionship. At best, the foundation of their race

was a cosmic accident that came about merely as a by-product

of the interaction between the Blood Queens body and the

material world. Yet this concept does not trouble the aboleth;

if anything, it has liberated them. If their progenitor is uncar-

ing and unfeeling to them, they are free to make their own

progress through existence without fear of reprisal or desire

to please. What the aboleth race has done and shall continue

to do, it does for itself.

Since their inception, aboleths have founded countless

empires in the watery reaches of the world. Their  rst empire

remains their longest-lived and most expansive. Built when

the world itself was a barren rock of boiling seas and choking

skies, this empire spanned the globe. With the world already

under their control, the aboleths turned their intellects to

other pursuits, primarily the creation of minions to perform

the dreary, day-to-day tasks of keeping their empire running.

They experimented with countless forms of life, including

constructs, oozes, elementals, vermin, and eventually more

complex  creatures  like  animals,  magical  beasts,  and  even

humanoids. The world of the primal empire was a place of

eternal  night,  truly  vast  oceanic  gulfs,  and  twisted  mon-

strosities fashioned by the aboleths in their own image. For

timeless ages, this primal empire prospereduntil disaster

struck.

What  precisely  destroyed  the  primal  empire  is  known

only to the aboleths, and they do not speak of it, even among

themselves. Sages of other races have posited theories. Perhaps

their slave races managed to rebel against them. Perhaps some

great  natural  disaster  struck.  Perhaps  the  aboleths  turned

on themselves in a  t of self-destruction. Perhaps the Blood

Queen or another of the Elder Evils returned and wreaked

unimaginable devastation.

One  popular  theory  holds  that  the  slave  races  developed

something new over those millions of years, something the

aboleths had no prior experience with and were thus wholly

unprepared to defend against. This theory claims that the slave

races developed faith and found that there were creatures above

the abolethscreatures with power even more awe-inspiring.

Apparently, these slaves called the deities into being, and the

deities smote the aboleths to a shadow of their former glory.

This, if true, would go a long way toward explaining the aboleth

races cultural disdain for divine magic.

Whatever the cause of it, the primal empires devastation

was not quite complete. Ruins of the empire survived here

and thereterrible structures founded on vile and unclean

geometric principles. While the aboleths themselves were

nearly obliterated, at least some survived. It might even be

possible that only one survived, for a single aboleth, given

time, can spawn legions. In any case, the world was free of

their reign for another span of time, perhaps millions of years.

When the aboleths again emerged from wherever they had

hidden, it was into a strange new world, one with a profu-

sion of life beyond what they had managed to achieve. They

could not know if this life had been visited upon the world

by  an  outside  force  of  divine  nature,  or  if  their  surviving

slaves  and  living  experiments  had  simply  evolved  during

their  absence.  The  aboleths  didnt  care;  they  simply  knew

that the world was theirs, and all other beings were vermin

to be exterminated.

Thus, the aboleths set about a great crusade to retake the

world. Through the millennia, their efforts have been repeated

time and time again; they conquer and hold the world for a

period before events conspire to wrench it away from their

control and force them once again into seclusion. Certainly,

the aboleths know how many times this cycle of triumph and

defeat has repeated itself, yet this is another subject they never

discuss. Learned individuals argue over the current state of

the aboleth empire; is it waxing or waning?

The growth and decline of this race is spread out over such

vast periods of time that it is akin to the observation of events

on a geologic scale. A pessimist believes that the aboleths are

still building their forces and preparing for an assault on the

world, while an optimist sees that they are again in decline.

Whatever the truth, it is unlikely that the aboleth race will

see any change in activity over the next few thousand years.

BILESTONE

Bilestone is similar to obsidian in texture and strength, but it

feels slightly greasy and warm to the touch. Large concentra-

tions of bilestone (such as a vein running through rock or por-

tions used in the construction of a building) have a debilitating

effect on the minds of all creatures within 30 feet that are not

aberrations.  If  such  a  creature  is  within  30  feet  of  a  cube  of

bilestone 5 or more feet on a side, it takes a 2 penalty on all

saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities and

on all Wisdom-based skill checks.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

However, there is always the possibility of unforeseen events.

Just as a massive volcanic eruption can change the face of a

world overnight, so can a single event change the strength

and power of the aboleth race for better or worse.

ABOLETH RELIGION

Aboleths are a race of agnostics. They acknowledge the exis-

tence  of  the  deities  of  the  lesser  races,  because  when  such

obvious proof as divine healing is so prevalent in the world,

only a fool would deny the presence of the gods, and the abo-

leths are not fools. Yet they do not see the deities as infallible or

all-powerful, for if indeed the deities had such might, then why

are the aboleths allowed to exist at all? Their own continued

existence and memories of a time before the gods is all the

proof they need to justify their disdain of the divine.

The aboleths acknowledge the fact that the gods are power-

ful, but they also know that the Elder Evils existed before the

deities of the current world, and they know that the Elder

Evils will remain after the world has come to an end. They

are beyond eternity. Aboleth minds do not grasp the concept

of faith, but they do understand the concept of respect, so the

creatures pay their respects to these Elder Evils. They do not

worship or gain divine aid from the Elder Evils. They build

great statues in their cities and model their buildings after the

supposed shape of the entities, but aboleths do not fawn over

them or expect anything of them. Indeed, it is doubtful that

any of the Elder Evils look more favorably upon the aboleths

than upon any other creatures. Nevertheless, this respect is

the closest the aboleth race comes to an actual religion.

Of the various Elder Evils, the aboleths save the majority of

their admiration and interest for a select  ve. These  ve Elder

Evils are those whose activities and dimensional wanderings

bring them most often in contact with the Material Plane. As

opponents, all of these Elder Evils should be on par with the

mightiest of demon lords or even deities themselves; meeting

an Elder Evil in combat should make even the greatest of epic

heroes quail. A better use for these beings is to keep them as

abstract concepts lurking in the roiling darkness beyond the

edge  of  sanity,  perpetual  terrors  whose  existence  threatens

life but can never be defeated.

Each of the  ve Elder Evils most commonly associated with

the aboleths are detailed below. Two of them are among the

few of their kind to exist wholly in the material world, while

the others are of interest because of their passing in uence

on the world at large.

Bolothamogg  (Him  Who  Watches  from  Beyond  the

Stars): Bolothamogg is said to be the darkness between the

stars, the guardian force or entity that exists to ensure that

nothing in the multiverse can escape to taint the true reality

of the outer dimensions. More a primal force than a physical

entity,  Bolothamogg  is  honored  in  aboleth  architecture  by

leaving large gaps and empty spaces in the facades of buildings,

and by constructing large open coliseums and other structures

without roofs.

Holashner (The Hunger Below): Holashner is one of the

few Elder Evils to exist fully in the physical world. Appearing

as part squid and part centipede, this massive creature burrows

through the deepest reaches of the world, driven only by its

unending hunger. It eats stone, magma, creatures, and anything

else in its path. The material it leaves behind is called the Black

Bile of the World by aboleths. This runny, tarlike substance

is explosive and volatile when exposed to air. Over the course

of only a few months, it can be compressed by tremendous

pressures into a black obsidianlike material called bilestone.

Fortunately for the world, Holashners progress through the

depths is far slower than the time required for bilestone to

degrade back into normal stone.

Holashner is honored in aboleth architecture by the inclu-

sion  of  myriad  spindly  protrusions,  tangled  foundations  at

the base of buildings, or, rarely, by the inclusion of bilestone

inlays in the buildings walls, ceiling, and  oor.

Piscaethces (The Blood Queen): Piscaethces, the source of

the aboleth race, is depicted as a vast aboleth with no tentacles

and with mucus the color of blood. The aboleths believe that

the Blood Queen travels the currents of probability between

in nite realities, spreading her seed almost as an afterthought

as she moves from one world to another. The aboleths do not

expect her return, but if she did come back and spawn a new

aboleth scion, that would be proof that existence is a circular

but  nite realm, and thus able to be conquered completely.

Piscaethces is honored in aboleth architecture by the inclusion

of large domed windows of red crystal.

Shothotugg  (Eater  of  Worlds):  Shothotugg  shares  one

quality with Holashnerit is one of the few Elder Evils to exist

entirely within the realm of the Material Plane. Shothotugg

dwells  in  a  distant  corner  of  the  multiverse,  physically  far

removed from the world itself. An undulant mass of seething

 uid the size of a mountain, Shothotugg travels through the

gulfs of space from world to world, poisoning and parasitizing

any  world  on  which  it  alights.  With  each  destruction,  the

fundamental forces in the Material Plane shift ever so slightly,

but over time, these changes signi cantly alter the multiverse.

Shothotugg is honored in aboleth structures by the placement

of large pools and fountains of magically treated and colored

liquids that are much heavier than water, or by swirling vortex

patterns laid into the  oor.

Ychak (The Violet Flame): Ychak is unique among the

Elder Evils in a terrible wayit is actively interested in the

development of life or, to be more precise, in the development

of the destruction of life. Its presence can be felt in civilizations

throughout time, because it acts as a muse and inspiration for

all that is destructive and ruinous. The aboleths believe that

the gods of cruelty, war, and death came to be as a result of

Ychaks whisperings. Ychak certainly encourages the worship

of evil deities. It appears to those it contacts as a seductive or

respectable member of the same race, but its true form is said to

be a brilliant pillar of violet  ames that conceal an inner form

so horrifying that to see it clearly is to invite utter destruction

upon the body and the soul. The aboleths honor Ychak in their

cities by the construction of massive pillars of violet  ame that

burn even underwater. The pulsations and writhing of these

columns of  re are used to mark the passage of time or even

to send simple messages out to the entire city at once.

Adopted Deities

With each passing incarnation of the aboleth empire, more

and more of their kind are exposed to divine magic and the

power of faith. Not all of the coldly logical aboleths are as quick

to discount the obvious bene ts of divine magic as inferior

to psionics or arcane magic. Of these aboleths, a few actually

come to realize that forging an alliance with a powerful entity

(about as far as an aboleth can go toward worshiping another

being) can be a useful advantage. Thus, the advent of aboleths

that become clerics, druids, and other divine spellcasters is

slowly on the rise. These aboleths are naturally drawn to the

worship of deities such as Ghaunadaur, the Patient One, and

Tharizdun (see pages 177178).

While  cities  of  devout,  deity-worshiping  aboleths  might

exist,  they  remain  the  exception  to  the  norm.  Traditional-

minded aboleths regard aboleths that adopt the gods of lesser

races as traitors of the worst sort, enemies of the aboleth race

as a whole.

The Aboleths and Cthulhu

Readers will notice a thematic resemblance between the abo-

leths, the Elder Evils, and various creatures or beings found

in the stories of H. P. Lovecraft. This is, of course, completely

intentional. Of all the major aberration races in the DUNGEONS

&  DRAGONS game,  the  aboleths  best  personify  the  sense  of

cosmic horror and the ultimate insigni cance of humankind

expressed in Lovecrafts writings. In fact, its quite easy to treat

the aboleths themselves as a Lovecraftian race akin to the elder

things featured in At the Mountains of Madness and The

Dreams in the Witch House.

By extension, the various monsters of the Cthulhu Mythos

 t nicely into encounters with aboleths or adventures set in an

aboleth city. Aboleth allies or servitors might include mi-go,

deep ones, dholes, gugs, shoggoths, or serpent people. Enemies

might include the elder things,  ying polyps, or the Great Race

of Yith.

Likewise, the  ve Elder Evils commonly honored by the

aboleths  could  be  previously  unknown  Great  Old  Ones  or

Outer Gods, or perhaps they are just alternate names for more

familiar entities:

Bolothamogg: Yog-Sothoth.

Holashner: Shudde Mell or Tsathoggua.

Piscaethces: Cthulhu or Shub-Niggurath.

Shothotugg: Azathoth.

Ychak: Nyarlathotep or Hastur.

ABOLETH LANGUAGE

Aboleths employ a fantastically complex language that is dif cult

for creatures with only one mouth to reproduce. Aboleths speak

through the numerous vents along their  anks, the same ori ces

they use to breathe and spew mucus into the surrounding water.

The simplest aboleth words require only one ori ce, but the more

complicated a word or concept is, the more vents are required

to properly pronounce it. Without exception, scholarly aboleths

have more mouths than their poorly endowed kin.

Lesser creatures with only one mouth can speak Aboleth,

but they are either limited to only the simplest words or forced

to  ape  the  complex  sounds  via  improvisation  or  additional

tools (such as  utes, bagpipes, or large brass horns like tubas

or trombones). In either case, to an aboleth, the speaker comes

off sounding uncultured and dull-witted.

The written language of the aboleths is likewise complex,

with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  intricate  glyphs  similar  to

abstract  hieroglyphics.  An  aboleth  writes  upon  stone  or

metal with tiny, thimblelike devices made of crystal that  t

over the tips of its tentacles. The aboleth dips the crystals into

dense acids that are not easily washed away by water, and then

etches the runes directly into the stone or metal tablets. All

four tentacle tips are used simultaneously to etch the runes;

a creature with only one or two hands takes a proportionally

longer time to write in Aboleth.

Aboleth  names  (both  for  themselves  and  for  their  cities)

run the gamut from wildly complex to ominously simple. The

aboleths make little distinction between a speci c aboleths

name and the name of its city; often, an aboleth citys name is

the same as the savant aboleth that founded the city. Arche-

typical  aboleth  names  include  Dupapn,  MavadNidhuned,

NevekDithasig, Sochsna, ToropJethixur, and Urdol.

RELATIONS WITH

OTHER CREATURES

Although the aboleths see themselves as the rightful rulers

of creation, they are also logical and realistic. They have come

to accept the fact that the world is a crowded place, at least

compared to the way it was during the primal empire of ages

past. These new, powerful races would pose a signi cant threat

to the aboleths were they to simply attack.

The  aboleths  mostly  ally  with  other  aquatic  races.  Since

their  lairs  and  cities  are  always  located  in  water  (and  are

completely submerged), terrestrial and airborne races have a

distinct disadvantage when it comes to assaulting an aboleth

in its home. Aquatic races, on the other hand, have no such

disadvantage. The aboleths thus ally with aquatic races and pool

their resources to wage war against and defend themselves from

the surface races. The aboleths  gure that once the nonaquatic

races are conquered, they can focus their attentions on their

aquatic neighbors and reconsider old alliances as needed.

The aboleths are now primarily a race that dwells in the

farthest reaches of the  ooded underground or in the light-

less trenches of the deepest oceans. These haunts severely

limit the number and variety of races the aboleths interact

with on a regular basis. Speci c relations with other races

of these regions are summarized below. As a general rule,

aboleths  treat  any  race  not  mentioned  here  as  fodder  for

slavery, dinner, or both.

Drow: The drow, one of the most numerous and successful

of the underground races,  nd themselves regularly coming

into contact with the aboleths or their allies. Usually, these

meetings  result  in  warfare,  but  an  increasing  number  of

aboleths and drow  nd a strangely comfortable connection

in the veneration of Ghaunadaur. Since the worship of this

An aboleth tries to ruin Regdars day

29

foul deity is viewed as heresy at best and treachery at worst

by their respective races, Ghaunadaur-worshiping drow and

aboleths frequently join forces to create cities that are dif cult

to assault by land or by sea.

Illithids: Aboleths make alliances with illithids more often

than with any other lesser race, for two reasons. First, the aboleths

and the illithids have similar mindsets; theyre coldly logical,

emotionless, and constantly hungry for knowledge. In addition,

the illithids view all other races as little more than fodder or

slaves, a viewpoint the aboleths naturally identify with.

Second,  the  inscrutable  mind   ayers  are  the  race  that

aboleths  come  the  closest  to  fearing.  The  aboleths  do  not

remember the genesis of the illithid race, not even in their

racial  memories.  As  far  as  the  aboleths  know,  the  illithids

simply appeared from nowhere, and that makes the aboleths

uncomfortable. The origin and capabilities of the mind  ayers

are unknown. Of course, the reason for this is simple: Mind

 ayers came to the world from the distant future. In a way,

the aboleths and the illithids are like cosmic bookends: two

similar races with similar goals, one from the ancient past and

one from the doomed future.

Ixitxachitl: Ixitxachitl (Monster Manual II page 128) are

a  common  ally  among  the  oceanic  aboleths,  serving  them

as elite warriors in a similar manner to the way the kuo-toas

serve  the  underground-dwelling  aboleths.  Certain  pockets

of aberrant ixitxachitl known as ixzan are said to lurk in the

deepest underground seas; the aboleths there welcome these

creatures into their cities as well.

Kopru: The aboleths feel strong ties of kinship to the kopru

(Monster Manual II page 134), a fellow aquatic race with the

power of mental domination and a history of a vast civiliza-

tion fallen into ruin. Yet where the aboleths have recovered

the glory of their past empires many times over the eons, the

kopru have yet to rebuild their cities.

Krakens: The aboleths pay these mighty and  erce lords

of the deep a measure of respect similar to that given to the

Elder Evils themselves. Willful enough that they are dif cult

to enslave and powerful enough to crush an aboleth to pulp

in seconds, krakens are afforded a wide berth. An aboleth city

might try to woo a kraken with offers of allianceperhaps

a trade of slaves and treasure in return for defense and alle-

giancebut they rarely attempt to coerce the mighty beasts.

A kraken escaped from enslavement is a force few aboleths

wish to encounter.

Kuo-toas: The kuo-toas are an obvious choice as allies for

the  aboleths  for  many  reasons.  First,  they  are  individually

much weaker than the aboleths and can be bullied into ser-

vitude. Second, they are amphibious and can carry out their

masters plans on the surface. The aboleths keep the kuo-toas

docile with their enslavement powers, but favored kuo-toa

leaders  are  allowed  to  keep  their  own  minds  as  a  reward

for  good  service.  Since  most  of  the  other  kuo-toas  remain

enslaved, the aboleths have no fear that the few free-willed

kuo-toas can engender rebellion.

ABOLETH LAIRS

Aboleth cities are located primarily in deep underground

seas and buried waterways miles below the surface of the

world, but not all aboleths dwell in these infamous sunken

cities.  A  relatively  large  number  can  be  found  closer  to

the surface.

Aboleths that live near the surface fall into one of three

categories. Some are slavers that live in regions heavily trav-

eled by members of useful slave races (such as humanoids

or giants); these aboleths dwell in small lakes or rivers near

underground trade routes. Once a slaver aboleth has collected

its quota of slaves (usually a dozen), it returns with them to

its home city before coming back to gather more.

Aboleths can also be found near the surface. These indi-

viduals have been forced to  ee the deeper cities due to their

religious or philosophical beliefs. They seek out others of their

kind with like-minded desires and form small communities

of their own.

The most commonly encountered aboleths near the surface

are  nomadic  members  of  their  race.  These  aboleths  have

become disillusioned with life in their sunken city, curious

about  the  surface  world,  or  perhaps  just  too  egotistical  to

remain a small part of a larger whole. These aboleths fancy

themselves leaders and deities, and they travel to the surface

to establish cults of enslaved humanoids to worship and tend

to their needs. They retain the standard aboleth disdain for

divinity but lack the desire to add to the legacy of the race.

Aboleths are immortal, after all; perhaps these nomads simply

 gure that the goals of their home city wont be realized for

several thousand years and decide to take a few centuries off

to relax near the surface.

Whatever their reason for relocating closer to the surface

world, aboleths craft lairs similar to those of their deeper-

dwelling  kin.  An  aboleth  lair  almost  always  features  an

underground  waterway  that  eventually  connects  to  a  vast

underground sea that is home to an aboleth city. Aboleths

that  live  in  lakes  or  rivers  not  connected  in  this  manner

always have a magical method of travel, such as teleportation

or shadow walking, that they use to travel to and from the

deep sunless seas.

Aboleths prefer to lair in natural caverns, although they

sometimes  seek  out  partially   ooded  ruins  as  well.  An

aboleths personal lair is completely underwater, with perhaps

a small beach or ledge overlooking a portion of the waters

surface. The route that connects the primary lair to the surface

or to more commonly traveled underground trade routes is a

maze of chambers and rooms,  ooded and populated with a

host of enslaved minions. These minions must visit the abo-

leth at least once a day to have their enslavements rekindled,

but  only  the  creatures  favorite  slaves  are  kept  nearby  and

transformed by its mucus cloud. Unless some of the minions

are particularly adept at crafting traps, aboleth lairs are free

of such hazards. The primary exceptions, of course, are the

illusions it uses to protect its personal lair.

ABOLETH MINIONS

With their ability to enslave other creatures, aboleths are never

without minions to guard their lairs, provide entertainment,

or otherwise serve their needs. The variety and nature of an

aboleths minions depend primarily on what kind of creatures

are native to its lair. An aboleth dwelling near a svirfneblin city

has numerous svirfneblin minions (as well as earth elementals

the svirfneblin clerics might have called up). An aboleth lurk-

ing in a pool below a hidden ledge that provides access to a

ruined city might have a large number of bullywug (Monsters

of Faern), tasloi (Oriental Adventures), or yuan-ti minions. An

aboleth dwelling at the bottom of a lake in the middle of a

human nation might keep any number of humans, hal ings,

dwarves,  elves,  and  gnomes  to  serve  its  needs.  An  aboleth

divides the duties of its available minions between assassins,

entertainers, procurers, and guardians as be ts each minions

strengths and weaknesses.

In  addition,  a  few  speci c  kinds  of  creatures  often  work

alongside the aboleths regardless of the nature of the regions

indigenous life.

Adventurers:  Adventurers  come  already  equipped  with

powerful weapons and magic gear, and an enslaved group can

put its potent tactics to good use.

Baatezu: Aboleths with the capability to summon aid from

the Outer Planes particularly enjoy calling upon the baatezu

for assistance. They  nd that the infernal mind offers riveting

conversation, and baatezu, highly capable combatants them-

selves, add immeasurably to an aboleths defenses. Aboleths

send other minions out to purchase or steal magic scrolls or

items that can be used to summon such devils and bind them

to servitude.

Constructs: Aboleths are fond of constructs as minions

because they are completely obedient and impossible for an

enemy to charm or control. The aboleths of the grand city of

Shaboath even developed a highly specialized form of golem

constructed from aboleth mucus; these golems have become

popular additions to cities with denizens powerful enough

to  construct  them.  However,  the  constructs  most  coveted

by the aboleths are those that have survived the passage of

innumerable eons. These elder eidolons are leftovers from

the primal empire, and aboleths devote hundreds of years

to  exploring  remote  corners  of  the  world  where  ruins  of

primal cities still stand in hopes of capturing a surviving

elder eidolon or two.

Derro: The derro are one of the few races that seem to under-

stand and accept the alien nature of the aboleths. Entire groups

of derro offer themselves as servants to aboleths of their own

free will. The aboleths appreciate their willingness to admit

inferiority  but  rarely  trust  these  creatures  with  important

tasks. Derro are used as shock troops along the periphery of

an aboleths territory.

Oozes: Aboleths have a particular fondness for the various

forms of ooze. Although they cannot directly control oozes

with their enslavement powers, they gather the creatures in

regions around their city, either as scavengers to help dispose

of waste or as guardians around the periphery. The only ooze

that  aboleths  avoid  completely  is  the  teratomorph  (Monster

Manual II, page 194); they  nd these creatures to be far too

unstable and unpredictable to be anything but a menace. The

arrival of a teratomorph in the vicinity of an aboleth city is

one of the few events that can prompt a total evacuation or

relocation.

Skum: The most iconic aboleth minions are the skum. Cre-

ated from human stock, these amphibious humanoids are bred

for their strength and combat skills. The number of skum an

aboleth commands is an excellent indication of that aboleths

standing in its society. The closest analogy in human society

is the collection and breeding of warhorses.

ABOLETH CITIES

Aboleth cities are truly alien and terrifying places, wholly

primeval in feeling and offensive to those used to structures

with hard edges, straight lines, and subdued colors. Aboleth

cities are built completely underwater, and because the waters

help support the buildings, the towers and spires can be of

a  much  greater  magnitude  than  anything  on  the  surface.

These  towers  feature  numerous  tunnels  and  openings  to

allow water currents to  ow around and through them to

prevent collapse. Aboleth cities can be raised from the sea

 oor by the will of the citys rulers, either through the use

of powerful spells or a magic device. The cities then drift

through the depths of the sea or rise to the surface and  oat

like horri c islands.

The buildings of an aboleth city are made of stone, built with

the aid of magic like stone shape but sometimes constructed

with  talented  and  well-directed  slave  labor.  Aboleth  build-

ings might be composed of brooding, drooping shapes that

look  melted  or  cancerous,  or  they  might  be  towering,  thin

spires with multiple twisted crenellations and jagged spikes.

All together, an aboleth city looks like discarded shells from

massive prehistoric shell sh scattered upon the ocean  oor.

As mentioned above, aboleths decorate their buildings with

 ourishes intended to honor or evoke the memories of the

Elder  Evils.  Needless  to  say,  these  embellishments  further

create a sense of wrongness about an aboleth city.

The disturbing and alien architectural styles found in an

aboleth city are typically direct in uences copied from their

memories of the primal empire, but in the case of the largest

and most secluded cities, these buildings might incorporate

actual structures that have survived from the primal empire

to  the  modern  age.  These  buildings  seethe  with  a  sense  of

brooding history, and damaging them is viewed as the greatest

offense possible to the aboleth race.

Each aboleth typically lives in a building far larger than it

needs, because the lower reaches are reserved for its slaves.

The leaders of an aboleth city are always savant aboleths; small

cities have only one leader, while in larger cities, several savant

aboleths might work together as a council.

ABOLETH CHARACTERS

Aboleths often advance in character classes. In particular, they

favor the  ghter, monk, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard classes.

Aboleth wizard spellbooks consist of stone tablets or metal

sheaves;  they  might  even  record  their  spells  on  the  inner

walls of their lair. Aboleths almost never gain levels in divine

spellcasting classes; clerics of Ghaunadaur, the Patient One,

and Tharizdun are rare exceptions to this rule.

As  for  prestige  classes,  aboleth  characters  take  levels  of

archmage, assassin, eldritch knight, and loremaster. Dragon

disciple aboleths are rumored to exist as well, and of course,

the majestic and dangerous savant aboleths rule their kind.

SAMPLE CHARACTER: ILTHARSHUB

The savant aboleth Iltharshub is a member of a council of four

savant  aboleths  that  rule  the  deep  city  of  Yolinithili.  Well

served by ample slaves and loyal aboleth mages, Iltharshub

spent large portions of its time sifting through the ancient

memories of its ancestors. It was thus with great shock that it

stumbled upon a memory of an ancient ruin from the primal

empirean aboleth laboratory located only a few dozen miles

away in a forgotten section of deep underground waterways.

Iltharshub pondered its memories of the ruins for several

more  days  and  came  to  realize  that  the  building  was  con-

structed  well  enough  that  it  likely  survived  the  passage  of

eons.  It  decided  there  and  then  to  claim  the  ruins  and  the

fantastic treasures lost within for its own. It did not want to

share any discoveries with its rivals on Yolinithilis council, so

it took only a single assistant and its most loyal and powerful

bodyguard, a greater stone golem. It then set off to  nd the

nameless ruins.

Encounter (EL 20): The PCs can encounter Iltharshub and

its golem and assistant in any number of ways. They might

stumble  across  the  aboleths  while  exploring  the   ooded

underground. They might be seeking out the same ruins, not

realizing that the site is an ancient aboleth laboratory. They

might also be hired by a powerful wizard who has learned that

one of the leaders of the nearby city of Yolinithili passed by

recently. The fact that a savant aboleth left the city intrigues the

wizard greatly, and he sends the PCs to investigate in return

for information, items, or spells they seek.

1. Entrance

This  building  is  fairly  unassuming.  Its  wooden  walls  and  wood

shingle roof are spotted with lichens and  laments of fungus, and

the solid stone foundation is thick with moss.

THE GOD IN THE LAKE

The sleepy village of Ravens Lake has a secret: A terrible god

lives in the depths of the settlements namesake.

The citizens of Ravens Lake know that something lives in

the lake. People who go out on the lake after dark go missing far

too often and frequently turn up weeks later with no memory

of where theyve been. The local church of St. Cuthbert has

been  abandoned  no  fewer  than  seven  times  in  the  last  two

years,  each  time  its  lone  cleric  packing  hastily  and   eeing

town without a word. Adventurers who come to Ravens Lake

have a habit of vanishing forever.

The truth is that something does indeed live in Ravens Lake,

but it is far from a deity. Its an exiled aboleth by the name of

Zlorthishen.

Adventure Hooks

The  PCs  could  be  drawn  to  Ravens  Lake  for  a  number  of

reasons. An associate might have visited the town and disap-

peared. A PC cleric might be asked by a superior to investigate

why clerics of St. Cuthbert never stay in the town longer than a

month. The PCs could just be passing through town and catch

wind  that  somethings  wrong  by  the  way  the  locals  regard

them with such sadness.

Ravens Lake could also serve as the genesis of a new cam-

paign.  The  PCs  could  all  be  locals  who  slowly  uncover  the

sinister secret that festers in the lake and the tunnels below

town.

No map of Ravens Lake is provided, so you can more easily

place the village in your campaign world. Detailed below is the

home of Huck One-Eye, an old hunter who lives in a simple

one-story house with a solid foundation.

Huck One-Eyes House

Huck One-Eye is an old human ranger who was the  rst person

the aboleth Zlorthishen enslaved after arriving in Ravens Lake

 ve  years  ago  via  an  underground  river.  The  aboleth  knew

that its survival depended on its quickly establishing a secret

stronghold  under  the  unknowing  eyes  of  the  locals,  and  it

enslaved Huck as he wandered alone by the lake edge. Over

the last  ve years, the aboleth has managed to secretly enslave

nearly half the town, including all of its leaders and prominent

members. Its slaves created a set of underground tunnels that

connected  the  lake  to  Hucks  basement,  and  recently  the

aboleth has started to breed skum in these tunnels.

After some investigations in town, the PCs should eventually

be led to Hucks home. No one talks, but careful observation

allows the PCs to note that despite the amount of traf c that

goes in and out of Hucks home, there never seems to be much

noise or clamor coming from inside the building.

Worn paths around the exterior of the house lead to the back

door (area 7) as well as to the nearby lakeshore.

2. Storeroom

This  room  is  completely  cluttered  with  a  fantastic  amount  of

junk. Coils of rope, old bows, barrels, crates, boxes,  shing poles,

broken bear traps, and more assault the eye.

None of the equipment here has seen any use since Huck was

enslaved; his hunting days are over.

3. Washroom

This  dirty,  foul-smelling  room  could  serve  as  a  washroom  only

for the bravest soul.

Hucks personal hygiene has always been a topic in town, and

his habits have not improved as a result of his enslavement.

4. Antler Storage

This room seems to have once been a bedroom, but before it can

serve as such again, someone needs to clean out the hundreds of

antlers stacked in tangled piles.

Huck had a liking for antlers: deer, elk, moose, peryton (see

Monsters of Faern)anything he could knock off and keep,

he tossed in here. He planned to sort them and keep only the

best, but he never got around to it. The antler collection has

taken over this room completely; Huck now sleeps on a pile

of rugs next to the stove in his living room (area 5).

5. Living Room (EL 3)

This room is warm but cloying; the air is thick with the scents of

unwashed  esh and smoke. Pieces of old, worn furniture sit in

the corners of the room, including chairs, a desk, shelves, and an

empty bookcase. A cast-iron stove sits to the north, and a  lthy

pile of rugs and blankets lies heaped in front of it.

This is where Huck sleeps, eats, and whiles away the hours as

he waits for his master below to contact him with a new task.

Hucks hearing isnt as good as it used to be, so chances are

he wont hear anyone who knocks on a door, or even anyone

who breaks into his home. If startled here, his initial attitude

is hostile. He yells and curses, hoping to drive the intruders

off, unless his attitude is adjusted at least to friendly, in which

case  he  calms  down  and  engages  in  idle  chatter.  If  made

helpful, he invites his visitors to dinner (water from rusty

bowls and rabbit stew thats a bit off). He wont reveal the

presence of the skum or the aboleth downstairs, but anyone

who speaks to him and makes a DC 15 Sense Motive check

realizes that hes being magically controlled somehow.

In any case, Huck uses his telepathic link with Zlorthishen

to warn the aboleth of intruders. If the PCs get too nosy, the

aboleth tells Huck to lead them down to the caves so the skum

can take care of them. Huck has done this many times before;

he pretends to panic and runs through the secret door in area 8

and into the caves below, leading the adventurers into a skum

ambush in area 11.

If freed from magical control, Hucks eyes clear and he tries

to  ee. He knows that the aboleth is doubtless sending skum

up the stairs at that very moment to collect him, and he wants

nothing more than to vanish into the wilderness. Hes right,

too; 2d4 rounds after the enslavement is lifted, a group

of   ve  skum  bursts  into  the  room  to  investigate,

recapture  Huck,  and  bring  him  downstairs  for

reenslavement.

6. Kitchen

This kitchen seems quite well organized, but everything is cov-

ered with a thick layer of dust except for a pathway of footprints

between the east and west doors.

Since his enslavement, Huck hasnt used his kitchen to cook

food. He instead moved the wood-burning stove into his living

room and cooks on it as the mood strikes him.

7. Skinning Room

This  large  room  contains  several  long  tables  and  tools  used  in

skinning animals and preparing furs. Everything here is covered

with a thick layer of dust, except for an

obvious  pathway  of  footprints  lead-

ing between the west door and the

north door.

9. Root Cellar

This  large  area  is  supported  by  numer-

ous  wooden  beams.  A  tangle  of  hundreds  of

strangely shaped gourds hang from above, and

stacks of  rewood and old dried fruit sit near the stairs.

10. Prison

This room reeks of algae-choked water. Thick green puddles of the

35

iron bars line the walls of this room, and a dripping, jagged hole

in the wall to the east opens into a cavern passageway.

Any PCs or NPCs captured by enslaved townsfolk are brought

here,  where  they  are  imprisoned  naked  in  a  cell  until  the

aboleth is ready to enslave them. The gates to these cells are

rusty and decrepit; a DC 23 Strength check is good enough

to rip one open. Unfortunately, prisoners are always tied with

ropes by a skum (Use Rope +1) as well. Generally, a prisoner

has to wait only 1d4+1 hours for the aboleth to call.

11. Interrogation Cavern (EL 7 if ambush is prepared)

This large cavern is humid and a bit chilly. Pools of brackish water

glisten on the  oor, and a single stout chair with manacles built

into the armrests and front legs sits in the middle of the room.

This  chair  is  used  to  restrain  the  few  individuals  that  the

aboleth has dif culty enslaving (such as nonhumanoids). Its

skum minions take turns questioning and beating the victim

to  nd out what it knows, and once the victim divulges what

the skum want to hear and is too battered to defend itself, it is

dragged into the cavern to the southeast to be killed.

If the PCs make it this far without being seen, theres a 40%

chance  that  1d4  skum  are  here  when  they  arrive.  If  Huck

telepathically  warns  the  aboleth  of  the  PCs,  all   ve  skum

(including Toruk) are here, hiding in the cave and prepared

to  ambush  the  group.  They  do  their  best  to  bull-rush  the

characters into the water to the east, where the skum have the

advantage.

12. Disposal Cavern (EL 4)

The   oor  of  this  long  cavern  angles  steeply  away  in  a  10-foot

drop. The  oor of the cave itself is spotless.

The aboleth, Huck, and the skum managed (with great dif-

 culty) to catch and herd a gray ooze into this cavern. The ooze

cannot climb out of the pit, and the skum use it to get rid of

victims whove been interrogated. A victim is tossed off the

ledge into the pit for the ooze to eat; the skum stick around to

watch unless theyre needed elsewhere.

This large cavern is  ooded completely with cold, dark water.

Zlorthishen has managed to breed only  ve skum so far, but

one has already become a 2nd-level  ghter. This skum is named

Toruk and serves as the leader when the aboleth is elsewhere.

If the skum havent been encountered elsewhere in the caves,

they are encountered here. The water in this area is 10 feet

deep, so the skum prefer to  ght enemies here.

14. Breeding Cavern

This cave smells of sickness and rotten food. Several shallow pits

line the northern wall, and blood-stained manacles dangle from

iron hooks driven into the wall above the pits.

Female prisoners who are enslaved and wont be missed by

anyone  in  town  face  a  truly  terrible  fate  here.  Zlorthishen

uses them as incubators for new skum. The birthing process is

nearly always fatal, and the remains are fed to the skum or the

ooze in area 12. If the PCs are searching for a missing female

NPC, she might well be imprisoned here.

15. Zlorthishens Lair

This  large,  underground  lake  ripples  softly,  almost  as  if  some

unseen thing were writhing just below the dark surface.

This large cavern is where Zlorthishen the aboleth lives. If the

PCs arrive without alerting the aboleth, theres a 75% chance

it  is  here.  If  it  knows  the  PCs  are  coming  (as  is  the  case  if

Huck warns it telepathically), it creates an illusory wall over

the southern section of the cave, and then creates a persistent

image of a kopru swimming in the main cave. It hopes to trick

the PCs into using some of their resources against the illusion,

which the aboleth tries to control in a realistic manner. The

image of the kopru quickly tries to escape through one of

the passages to the east.

If the PCs follow, Zlorthishen uses project image to send an

image of itself into the cave behind them and tries to enslave

them via the image. Any PC who approaches the image is hit

with hypnotic patterns. If the aboleth is discovered, it  ghts until

reduced to below half its hit points, at which time it  ees into

the depths of Ravens Lake to heal and plot revenge.

A  search  of  the  southern  section  of  the  cave  uncovers  a

respectable  amount  of  loot  that  the  aboleth  collected  from

other  adventurers  and  victims.  The  spoils  consist  of  4,120

sp, 1,003 gp, two thunderstones, a masterwork light wooden

shield, a spyglass worth 1,000 gp, a potion of bears endurance,

a wand of bulls strength (20 charges), a +1 scimitar, and a pair of

boots of striding and springing.

eholders  are  perhaps  the  most  deadly  of  the  great

aberration races. They are certainly one of the most

distinctive and unusual in appearance.

The  original  beholders  are  said  to  have  been

spawned on one of the Outer Planes by a primal entity as

powerful as a deity. This creature has no name, and its children

have no need to generate one for it. To others, it is known

only as the Great Mother, a name granted more for the fact

that the creature spawned the entire beholder race from its

very  esh than for any real certainty that it is female. From

the Great Mother, the beholder race and its various kin have

propagated to the other planes with great success, for few can

stand in the way of such destructive creatures.

Although the information in this chapter is presented as

fact, beholders are alien creatures in body, mind, and soul.

Even Iphegor of the Ebon Mirror might not have divined all

of their secrets, nor recorded everything he discovered in his

Codex Anathema.

BEHOLDER ANATOMY

Although beholders might look like relatively simple crea-

tures, they are in fact complex and alien in nature. Some of

their features and internal organs have similar shapes and

functions to those found in other creatures, but many of them

are wholly unique to these terrible monstrosities.

EXTERNAL ANATOMY

A beholders body appears, on the outside, quite simple.

It consists of a single sphere about 8 feet wide, but its not

unusual to  nd a specimen slightly smaller or even much

larger. A beholders natural buoyancy cuts down on its

weight somewhat, but their bodies are still dense and

compact. An 8-foot-diameter beholder typically weighs

anywhere between 4,000 and 5,000 pounds.

A beholders skin has the strength of steel. Apart from

the specialized skin of the eyelids and along the jaws,

beholder skin is singularly in exible. Coloration and

texture varies widely from one beholder to the next.

Some beholders have smooth, almost shiny skin of a

single drab color, while others have brightly colored or

even striped or spotted skin that seems to be comprised

of  thick,  bony  interlocking  plates.  Each  beholder

thinks of itself as the true form spawned eons ago by

the  Great  Mother,  and  any  variations  exhibited  by

other beholders are taken to be marks of inferiority.

The  esh of a beholders eyestalks is tough and

 brous, but unlike the skin that covers its body,

this skin is quite  exible. On most beholders, each

eyestalk is smooth and rubbery, almost like a tentacle.

Again, there can be much variation. Some beholders

have segmented eyestalks similar to a worms body,

while  others  have  articulated,  almost  insectlike

37

stalks composed of numerous knuckles and digits that can

rotate and bend in any direction.

A  beholders  mouth  performs  the  same  functions  as  a

humans mouth; it has a tongue, soft upper and lower palates,

and upper and lower teeth. A beholders teeth are long, thin,

and sharp, designed for ripping and tearing.

A beholders sensory organs are, for the most part, not quite

as acute as a humans. Their sense of touch has atrophied nearly

to the point of uselessness, except for the surface of the tongue.

Beholders use their tongue to feel objects, since this  eshy

muscle is quite sensitive. One thing its not well designed for,

ironically, is taste. Beholders have no sense of taste whatsoever,

which might explain why they eat anything that falls prey to

them. Beholders detect scents through thousands of miniscule

openings (called spiracles) over the surface of their bodies, and

it is through these openings that they also breathe. Of the four

nonvisual senses, only a beholders hearing approaches that of

a humans. Beholders typically have a dozen small tympanic

membranes at almost random spots across their bodies; each

is merely an inch in diameter and impossible to see except

upon the closest examination.

Of course, beholders nonvisual senses are so rudimen-

tary  primarily  because  their  eyes  are  so  much  more  so

developed.

EYES

Its  multiple  eyes  are  a  beholders  most  notable  (and

feared) anatomical feature. In addition to providing the

creature  with  all-around  vision,  the  eyes  can  be  used

to aim, direct, and emit powerful supernatural effects.

These effects aside, the eye of a beholder is a wondrous

and complex organ that has long been the obsession of

countless sages and wizards.

A  beholders  eyeball  is  remarkably  hard  and  solid,

about as strong as a similarly sized ball of stone. While

at rest, the eyes have a round, brilliantly colored iris (1).

The  iris  seems  to  be  some  sort  of  translucent  crystal

consisting  of  hundreds  of  interlocking  sheaves,  each

of  which  is  capable  of  independent  movement.  This

allows a beholder amazing control over the shape of its

iris and the amount of light that is allowed to enter the

eye. A beholder can adjust its iris to almost any shape

imaginable, and can even expand it to the rim of its eye

socket to give the appearance of having no iris at all.

Curiously, a beholders eye doesnt have a single lens.

Rather, an eye can have as many as a dozen differently

sized and shaped lenses (2), all capable of independent

rotation and movement and linked to the movement of

the iris. By adjusting these lenses and the iris, a beholder

can aim with its eye ray. The numerous lenses have the

added bene t of granting the creature exceptional vision.

All beholders possess darkvision out to 60 feet, and in

brightly lit conditions can count the legs on a mosquito

at over twice this distance.

The interior of a beholders eye is a tangled mess of

transparent, nearly invisible strands of nervous tissue

called evocularies (3). Each evoculary feeds directly into one of

the eyes three retinas and anchors an iris sheath (4), a lens, or

both. The evocularies not only aid in the movement of the vari-

ous components, but also transmit light and magic energy from

the retinas to the lenses and vice versa. Each eye has a slightly

different con guration of evocularies. In one eye, they might

form a complex spiral. In another, they might form tightly wound

corkscrew patterns. In a third, they might be taut and straight.

The nature of an eyes evoculary con guration is believed to be

what focuses the raw magic energy the creature generates deep

in its brain to create its signature eye ray effects.

The three retinas (5) of each eye coil into a highly complex,

braidlike structure as they wind down the stalk or up behind

the central eye to converge deep inside the creatures body and

brain. The raw magic energy that powers a beholders eye rays

is transmitted along this braid from the dweomerlobes of its

brain.

INTERNAL ANATOMY

A beholders outer body, although strange, at least seems logi-

cal in construction. The farther one gets into the innards of a

beholder, however, the more alien and unusual the components

become.  Its  internal  organs  are  a  tangled,  brightly  colored,

often inscrutable mess of tubes, sacs, coils, and things that

have little or no analogy to those found in a human. Sages have

managed to pin down the purpose for some of these organs

The beholder revealed (numbers keyed to text references)

by  the  process  of  elimination  or  by  their  proximity  to  the

creatures mouth. A beholders digestive system (and its con-

nected circulatory and respiratory systems) is fairly obvious.

Beyond these, sages are positive about only the reproductive

organs and the brain.

Perhaps  the  most  unusual  shared  feature  of  a  beholders

internal  organs  is  their  freakish  buoyancy.  Even  when

separated from the remainder of the body, these organs  oat

like  balloons,  despite  the  fact  that  they  rarely  contain  any

appreciable volumes of air or natural gas (with the exception of

the lung itself). An internal organ separated from a beholders

body  retains  this  buoyancy  for  up  to  12  hours,  or  longer  if

preserved by magic like gentle repose. This natural buoyancy

allows a beholder to  y, its motions and movement controlled

by bursts of air expelled from its thousands of spiracles.

Skeletal System

Technically,  beholders  are  endoskeletal  creatures,  although

what passes for a skeleton in their bodies really amounts to

nothing more than a large skull. The material that comprises the

skull isnt bone, though; in fact, it is so similar in construction to

the creatures skin that its impossible to tell where the skin ends

and the skull begins. The material is hard, in exible, and, above

all else, remarkably light. Despite the fact that it is incredibly

porous (a cup of water poured onto a sample of beholder bone

is absorbed in a matter of seconds), it remains rigid and nearly

as strong as iron. Unfortunately, the material quickly grows

brittle upon a beholders death. Some alchemists have devised

methods to maintain the bones strength after the creatures

death, but because this material is only about as strong as iron

and much more dangerous to harvest, armor and weapons made

of beholder bone remain little more than curiosities.

Vascular and Digestive System

The most readily obvious set of internal organs make up the

creatures  digestive  tract.  The  back  of  a  beholders  mouth

consists of a powerful sphincterlike muscle (1), opening into

a short esophagus (2) and then into a large,  at stomach (3) that

 lls most of the hollow inside its lower jaw. Numerous smaller

tubes  that  are  similar  to  intestines  (4)  branch  off  from  the

stomach and coil up the back of the creature. As they continue

to split, they carry the lique ed remains of a meal farther up

into the body. Eventually, these intestines become as thin as

hairs, and they coil around and through a large, fan-shaped

organ (5) that contains hundreds of tiny, air- lled channels.

This is the beholders lung, and the channels constantly mix

air with digested food to produce a frothy, pink  uid.

The lung itself is lined with powerful muscles that expand

and contract rhythmically, drawing in and expelling air from

the spiracles in a beholders skin. From the lung, hundreds

of thousands of  ne arteries branch out to deliver the  uid

mixture to the other organs. This runny material is pumped

through the creatures body by the pulsations of the lung. Once

the nutrients and oxygen provided by the  uid are completely

consumed, the waste liquid drains back into the beholders

cavernous maw. It is then expelled or, more often, it dribbles

out in a constant stream of foul-smelling drool. A beholder that

goes without food grows more lethargic as its body begins to

dry out.

Anything  a  beholder   nds  indigestible  is  either  vomited

back up and spat out or slowly absorbed into the lining of its

stomach and eventually embedded in the inside surface of its

skeleton.

Reproductive System

Beholders are gender neutral, and they become fertile only

once  in  their  lives.  During  this  period  (which  happens

within the  rst forty years of a beholders life), the creature

grows increasingly more erratic and paranoid in behavior. A

strange ovoid organ (6) below the back of the creatures tongue

grows large and swollen; this is the creatures womb. A typical

beholder gestates up to twelve young in its womb over a period

of nearly six months, during which time it grows more and

more active and cantankerous. A pregnant beholder eats nearly

four times its normal amount of food for the  rst four months

of its term, storing up food reserves in its stomach, intestines,

and even its lung. During the  nal two months, the creatures

womb has swollen so large that its mouth becomes incapable of

swallowing more food, and its tongue protrudes grossly from

its maw. A beholder is at its most paranoid during this time

and remains hidden in its lair until it gives birth.

The  birthing  of  new  beholders  is  a  sight  that  few  have

witnessed,  and  by  all  accounts,  its  something  that  even

fewer would want to witness. When a brood comes to term,

a beholders jaw unhinges, and it regurgitates its womb out

through the mouth. The creature bites the womb off, and it

 oats gently in the air. The young beholders are forced to chew

their way out of the gory mass to freedom; they are capable of

 ight immediately, but their eye powers develop later in life.

Although  a  beholder  gives  birth  to  up  to  a  dozen  young  at

once, only a handful survive. The parent observes its young

and decides which look most like itself. The others are eaten

by the ravenous parent, along with the discarded womb, and

the surviving young are forced from the parents lair within

the hour to fend for themselves.

Central Nervous System

A beholders intense magical power and energy are gathered

and directed in the internal organs that comprise its nervous

system and brain (7). Some theorize that beholders gather magi-

cal energy from the bodies of spellcasting creatures theyve

eaten, while others believe that they simply absorb ambient

magic from the environment.

In fact, a beholders vast store of magical power is directly

connected to its eyes. Just as the creatures braided optic nerves

transmit light to the brain to allow sight, so do the eyes transmit

magic to the brain for storage and augmentation. A beholder

can absorb magical energy by looking at spell effects in action,

by observing magic creatures like constructs or spellcasters,

by gazing upon ancient relics and minor magic baubles, and

by simply reading or studying spellbooks. It can even absorb

magic from watching its own eye rays, recycling the power

back into its brain as it uses them.

The amount of magical energy the eyes absorb is miniscule;

a beholder could study the same magic missile scroll nonstop

for months before the study would render the scroll useless.

The more powerful and permanent the magic is, the longer

it takes to absorb. Further, beholders build up tolerances to

magic of the same variety. A beholder would gain much less

magical energy from studying a single pair of winged boots over

the course of a week than it would from studying an entire

library  full  of  arcane  tomes.  A  beholder  that  goes  without

a  steady  supply  of  new  magic  to  study  grows  cantankerous

and paranoid. More than any sense of greed, this forces the

creature to hoard magic items as treasure or to seek out ruins,

dungeons, and other repositories of powerful magic.

A beholders brain is quite large. Much of it consists of two

lobes that descend down to the left and right like horns. These

are known as dweomerlobes, and it is here that magical energy

is stored and ampli ed.

THE BEHOLDERS MIND

A beholders mind, like its body, is alien to the natural world

and  actually  consists  of  two  separate,  independent  minds.

These minds can be categorized as the rational mind and the

intuitive mind. Having two minds does not give a beholder any

sort of tactical or magical advantage; if anything, it is perhaps

the monsters greatest disadvantage.

The  rational  mind  is  a  coldly  logical  machine  that  clas-

si es  information  into  forms  and  shapes  that  a  beholder

can assimilate. It stores plans, magical knowledge, personal

rationalizations, memories, and goals.

The intuitive mind consists of what a beholder sees. It sorts

what it observes to determine what can and cannot be passed

on to the rational mind. Here, a beholder keeps suppressed

memories and suppressed knowledge, details of past failures,

and theories that would shatter its rational mind.

In the gulf that exists between a beholders two minds lurk

its paranoia and xenophobia. Beholders are considered to be

insane, but not all beholders suffer from the side effects of

having two minds. In some, their rational and intuitive minds

work together to assimilate thoughts and plans without hiding

truth and knowledge. These beholders are considered sane,

and they can interact with other creatures in a nondestructive

manner, although they remain just as capable of cruelty and

sadism as the more common variety. (See Beholder Society,

below, for more details.)

BEHOLDER LIFE

Theoretically,  a  beholder  can  live  for  more  than  a  hundred

years. In practice, though, only a few survive their  rst decade,

since beholders spend their early years exploring and seeking

a proper lair.

A  newborn  beholder  possesses  strong  racial  memories.

Within minutes of emerging from the womb, it can speak the

beholder language and already displays powerful xenophobic

and intolerant attitudes. For these reasons, it is dif cult for a

beholder to become anything but evil.

Newborn beholders grow quickly. For the  rst few months

of  life,  though,  they  are  fairly  helpless,  since  their  eye  rays

take some time to develop. A beholder needs to spend several

months observing magic before its eye rays develop fully. For

beholders born in remote ruins or magic- lled dungeons, the

proper development of their eye rays takes about two to three

months. Until then, they keep low pro les and feed on smaller

animals and beasts. In areas where magic is scarce, it can take

up to a year for a beholders eyes to absorb enough magic to

properly fuel its powers.

Physically, a beholder reaches normal size and maturity at

two years of age. Afterward, its growth continues at a much

slower rate. In theory, a beholder becomes increasingly frail

as it progresses beyond its ninetieth year. By the age of one

hundred, its eyestalks begin to lose their powers and wither

away. Only rarely do beholders live past the age of one hundred

twenty. In practice, though, a beholder cunning and strong

enough  to  survive  attacks  from  powerful  adventurers  and

other beholders  nds a way to extend its lifespan with magic.

If a beholder can stave off aging, it continues to grow slowly

in size. Stories persist of immense beholders several hundred

years old and nearly 20 feet in diameter.

THE BEHOLDER DIET

Despite  its  awesome  power  and  magical  might,  a  beholder

remains at its core a physical being. It must eat and drink, and

often these are its only vices and indulgencesapart from the

intellectual pursuit of magical knowledge or the domination

of lesser races.

A beholder is omnivorous and can gain sustenance from

anything organic. A typical beholder must consume about 10

pounds of food and drink and at least 2 gallons of water per

day. For beholders, the act of feeding and drinking is their

greatest physical pleasure, and as such, they often consume far

more than they need. For example, a beholder could eat a large

fallen foe, consisting of up to 200 pounds of meat and several

pints of blood, in one sitting. While this far exceeds what the

creature needs for that day, it wont turn down any additional

offers of food or drink that happen to present themselves.

Because a beholders sense of taste is so atrophied, it  nds

satisfaction in the texture and visual qualities of the food. To a

beholder, desirable food has an interesting texture (the combina-

tion of soft  esh and crunchy bones found in living creatures

is considered a delicacy) or an interesting shape or color, since

it can observe its food with its front eyestalks as it eats. For this

reason, a beholder prefers colorful food over drab food.

Beholders  nd wine especially pleasing. Alcohol is one of the

few tastes that beholders can experience, and this, combined

with the colorful varieties of wine, make it an ideal beholder

drink. A beholders body processes alcohol very ef ciently, so

the quantity of wine required to intoxicate a typical beholder

usually exceeds the amount available to drink. As a general

rule, a beholder can imbibe well over 10 gallons of wine before

getting drunk.

Since beholders often overeat, their bodies are capable of

dealing  with  sudden  gluts  of  food.  A  beholders  digestive

system can store a large amount of material (600 pounds or

more) inside the various folds of its stomach. The creature can

process this stored food at the rate of about 20 pounds per day,

during which time it need not eat (although it must still drink

normally). Food in excess of this simply cannot be swallowed.

Although a sated beholder might chew on food simply for the

texture and enjoyment of eating, it allows the chewed food to

drop from its mouth when the texture is gone.

A  beholders  favorite  foods  include  small  live  mammals,

exotic mushrooms and other fungi, gnomes, beef, pork, color-

ful leafy vegetables, leaves,  ower petals, insects, and birds.

BEHOLDER VARIANTS

Beholders  are  hateful  creatures,  and  nothing  inspires  their

hatred more than other beholders. In theory, a beholder could

get  along  well  enough  with  another  beholder  that  looked

similar  to  itself,  but  over  time,  beholders  always   nd  tiny

imperfections in a companion that drive them to rage. Each

beholders physical characteristics are unique, and no beholder

would regard another as anything other than an inferior, good

only for food.

Physical differences are the most minor of variations among

beholders. Two notable beholder variants, the elder orb and the

hive  mother,  possess  wildly  different  abilities  from  those  of

normal beholders. Beyond these are the myriad forms of behold-

erkin, true aberrations among the race. Creatures like gauths,

overseers, and eyes of the deep are the subjects of wrath among

true beholders, for they are similar enough in appearance and

ability to be regarded as mockeries of the beholder self-image.

Elder Orb

One in every several hundred beholders is born with amaz-

ing longevity. These beholders are known as elder orbs, and

the source of their longevity is hotly debated. The elder orbs

themselves  believe  that  it  is  proof  that  they  embody  the

primal purity of the Great Mother. An elder orb is effectively

immortal; it never grows senile or in rm from age and can live

forever unless it perishes from violence or disease.

Elder  orbs  have  statistics  similar  to  those  of  standard

beholders,  although  most  have  signi cantly  advanced  Hit

Dice. All elder orbs have at least six levels of sorcerer. They

favor spells without material components (or take the Eschew

Materials feat), but they can easily produce a spells somatic

components with their eyestalks. Elder orbs never summon

familiars. Naturally, they must close their central eye when

casting spells.

When  an  elder  orb  reaches  venerable  age,  it  stops  losing

physical ability score points for increasing age but continues to

gain mental ability score points. The cumulative effect of middle

age, old age, and venerable age therefore modify the elder orbs

ability scores as follows: 3 Str, 3 Dex, 3 Con, +3 Int, +3 Wis,

and +3 Cha. Elder orbs have enough additional racial Hit Dice

that their size increases to Huge; this helps offset their lower

Strength and Constitution scores, but, in the end, elder orbs

are less agile than standard beholders.

Eye  of  the  Deep:  An  eye  of  the  deep  rarely  comes  into

con ict with true beholders, for this aquatic variant dwells

deep  underwater.  It  has  only  two  eyestalks,  but  its  massive

pinchers make it a dangerous combatant.

Hive Mother

Even  rarer  than  elder  orbs  are  hive  mother

beholders.  Although  their  name  implies  a

feminine gender, these beholders are as gen-

der-neutral as typical members of their

species. Their name stems

more from the fact that

they have the ability to

magically dominate other

beholders. Hive mothers

form  large  commu-

nities  of  beholders

to  serve  them.  This

is how beholder cities

originate; left to their own

devices, beholders would rather slay

their kin than live in harmony with

them.

Hive mothers are

universally  larger

and  fiercer  than

typical  beholders.

For  hive  mother  statis-

tics, see page 135.

Death Tyrant

These  truly  reprehensible  creatures  are

undead beholders akin to zombies, though

they  retain  some  innate  magical  abilities.

These creatures are used by powerful wizards

as guardians; they are almost never encoun-

tered near other beholders, who  nd them

abhorrent. Death tyrants are detailed on page

309 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Beholderkin

A vast number of beholderkin exist. Not true beholders, these

creatures do not share the races xenophobia, although most

are still quite evil and cruel in nature. True beholders consider

beholderkin to be abominations.

The death kiss, eyeball, and gouger are detailed in Monsters

of  Faern.  The  gauth  is  detailed  in  the  Monster  Manual.  For

statistics for the director, eye of the deep, overseer, and specta-

tor, see Chapter 8.

Death  Kiss:  This  creatures  eyestalks  are  replaced  with

blood-draining tentacles, and its body roils with a powerful

electric aura.

Director: A director is often found dwelling in a beholder

community  led  by  a  hive  mother  or  an  overseer.  It  has  six

eyestalks and three clawed tentacles with which it bonds with

monstrous vermin mounts.

42

Eyeball: An eyeball is a Tiny beholderkin with four eye-

stalks;  they  are  popular  familiars  in  some  wizardly  and

sorcerous circles.

Gauth: Easily the most common of the behold-

erkin, a gauth has six eyestalks and a central eye

that can stun its enemies.

Gouger:  A  gougers  ten  eyestalks  are

magically useless. Its central eye retains

the  antimagic  proper-

ties  of  true  beholders,

and  four  small  legs  hang

from the creatures under-

side.  A  gougers  most

hideous  feature,  though,

is its long, barbed tongue,

which is adept at temporar-

ily  neutralizing  beholder

eyestalks.

Overseer:  An  overseer

is  the  most  dangerous  of

the known beholderkin.

Rivaling  the  power  of  a

hive mother, an overseer

resembles  nothing  so

much as a large,  eshy tree

with  mouths  on  its  trunk

and eyes on its branches.

Spectator:  A  spectator  is  an  extraplanar

beholderkin with four eyestalks. Somewhat mild

and  even-tempered,  spectators  have  even  been

known to form friendships with other creatures,

a trait that no other beholderkin or true beholder

ever displays.

An elder orb is a foe

to be feared

BEHOLDER MAGE

A  normal  beholder  can  become  a  wizard  or  sorcerer.  The

more  ancient  beholders  are  powerful  arcanists  (see  Elder

Orbs, above) that have used magic to extend their lifespans.

Nevertheless, two practical limitations keep beholders from

becoming spellcasters. First, their lack of hands makes it hard

for them to use large numbers of spell components. Second,

their central eyes antimagic cone makes the study and use of

arcane magic dif cult.

However, an increasing number of beholders are embracing

a practice once held to be vile and unthinkable to their kind.

Through ritual destruction of its central eye, a beholder can

learn to channel and use magic much more quickly and ef -

ciently than can almost any other race. These are the members

of the beholder mage prestige class, and the power they wield

is truly impressive.

Entry Requirements

Race: True beholder (beholderkin cannot become beholder

mages).

Special: Must put out central antimagic eye.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  beholder  mage

prestige class.

Spells:  A  beholder  mage  gains  the  ability  to  cast  arcane

spells. These spells are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell

list.  At  1st  level,  a  beholder  mage  masters  all  the  cantrips

detailed in the Players Handbook and also knows two 1st-level

spells. Each time it gains a level, it automatically learns two

more spells of any level it can cast.

To learn or cast a spell, a beholder mage must have an Intel-

ligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Dif culty

Class for a saving throw against a beholder mages spell is 10 +

the spell level + the beholder mages Intelligence modi er. A

beholder mages spells function at a caster level equal to twice

its beholder mage level.

A beholder mage can cast only a certain number of spells of

each spell level per day. Its base daily spell allotment is given

in Table 31. In addition, it receives bonus spells per day if it

has a high Intelligence score.

A beholder mage combines the best of two worlds; it can

learn new spells as a wizard can, and there is no upper limit

to the number of spells it can learn and know. However, it

casts its spells on the  y like a sorcerer. A beholder mage of

high level typically knows a huge number of spells and can

call upon any one of them at any time, providing it has a spell

slot open of the appropriate spell level.

Starting at 1st level, whenever a beholder mage gains the

ability to cast a new level of spells, it must sacri ce the use

of its eye rays from one of its ten small eyestalks. From then

on, that eyestalk casts spells of that level and is referred to as

a spell-stalk. At 10th level, all of its eyestalks are spell-stalks.

As with its eye rays, casting a spell from a spell-stalk is a free

action (although a single spell-stalk can cast only one spell

per  round).  The  spell  is  technically  considered  a  cast  spell

(as opposed to the use of a spell-like ability), and thus the act

of casting provokes attacks of opportunity normally. A spell

cast  from  a  spell-stalk  otherwise  resolves  normally;  unlike

an eye ray, it does not need to make a ranged touch attack to

successfully strike a target (unless the spell itself requires a

touch attack). The standard beholder limitation against turning

more than three eyestalks in any particular direction (that is,

forward, backward, left, right, up, or down) still applies.

Beholder mages do not require material components to cast

their spells. The ruined central eye acts as an arcane focus for

KULARKUTHAN, ELDER ORB

Kularkuthan  is  a  particularly  ancient  beholder  elder  orb  with

formidable sorcerous skill. It would make an excellent primary

villain  for  a  long  campaign  against  a  powerful  beholder  cult;

the elder orbs high Intelligence score and impressive Charisma

score make it a natural leader.

New feats described on pages 4445.

Languages: Beholder,  Common, Undercommon,  Draconic,

Infernal, Dwarven.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of a beholders ten small eyes can produce

a magical ray once per round as a free action. During a single

round, a beholder can aim only three eye rays at targets in any

one 90-degree arc. Each eye ray resembles a spell cast by a 13th-

level caster, with a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 30. See

the Monster Manual, pages 2627.

Antimagic Cone (Su): A beholders central eye continually

produces a 150-foot cone of antimagic that functions just like

an antimagic field (caster level 13th). Once each round, during

its turn, the beholder decides whether the cone is active or

not.

Flight (Ex): A beholders buoyancy allows it to fly and grants

it  a  permanent  feather  fall  effect  (as  the  spell)  with  personal

range.

Spells Known (6/9/9/8/8/8/8/6/4 per day; caster level 16th):

New spells described in Chapter 9.

Possessions: bracers of armor +8, ring of protection +5, ring of

wizardry (IV), amulet of health +6, lens of ray doubling (worn

on flesh to stone eye and with 5 charges remaining), two lenses of

ray widening (one worn on disintegrate eye and with 4 charges

remaining, one worn on finger of death eye and with 6 charges

remaining). Kularkuthan has read a tome of leadership and influ-

ence +5; his +5 inherent bonus to Charisma is included in the

statistics block above.

New magic item described on page 46.

All-Around Vision (Ex): Beholders are exceptionally alert; their

eyes give them a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks,

and they cant be flanked.

all the creatures spells. If a spell normally requires a material

component that carries with it a gold-piece cost, the beholder

mage instead spends a number of experience points equal to

one- fth of the normal gold-piece cost (minimum of 1 experi-

ence point). The somatic components of a beholder mages spells

are supplied by the weaving and waving of its spell-stalks. The

verbal component of a beholder mages spells is the creatures

special  spellcasting  song.  The  song  takes  effort;  a  beholder

mage that is casting spells cannot speak or use its mouth to do

anything else that round, including making bite attacks.

Arcane Hands (Su): A beholder mage develops the ability

to manipulate objects as if with a mage hand spell. This ability is

constantly active and can not only manipulate objects but also

use magic items like wands, staffs, rods, and some wondrous

items (like a bag of tricks). The hand cannot activate items that

must be worn to utilize an effect (such as a helm of brilliance).

A beholder mages arcane hand has an effective Strength

score  equal  to  the  creatures  beholder  mage  class  level.  An

arcane hand can be used to perform any attack or defensive

action for which a regular hand can be used. Using an arcane

hand to make an unarmed strike provokes attacks of oppor-

tunity unless the beholder mage has the Improved Unarmed

Strike feat. Theoretically, a beholder mage with monk levels

could use its arcane hand for its unarmed attacks.

Ocular  Transformation  (Su):  At  10th  level,  a  beholder

mages ruined central eye undergoes a supernatural transfor-

mation and can absorb magic energy directed at the beholder.

This grants the beholder spell resistance equal to its Hit Dice

+5 (maximum spell resistance of 30).

If the creatures spell resistance succeeds in preventing the

effect of a spell, its central eye begins to glow with red light

equivalent to that of a torch. While it glows, the eye no longer

grants spell resistance. In order to regain spell resistance, the

beholder must spend a full-round action to absorb the energy

stored in the eye. At the end of the full-round action, the eye

stops  glowing,  and  the  beholders  spell  resistance  is  again

effective.

Absorbing the energy stored in the eye does not provoke

attacks of opportunity, and it heals the beholder of 5 points of

damage per spell level absorbed. Hit points gained in excess

of the beholders normal maximum are lost.

BEHOLDER FEATS

Beholders  are  highly  intelligent  creatures  with  an  ancient

history, so it should come as no surprise that they have devel-

oped unique feats to further enhance their already formidable

abilities.

AGILE TYRANT

A  creature  with  this  feat  develops  longer,  more   exible

eyestalks than its kin. This extra  exibility allows it to bring

additional eye rays to bear against its foes.

Prerequisite: True beholder or beholderkin.

Bene  t: The creature can direct an extra eye ray into a single

90-degree arc.

BANE OF THE UNCLEAN

A creature with this feat hates aberrant beholders so strongly

that it gains bonuses when  ghting them.

Prerequisite: True beholder or must have aberration as a

favored enemy.

Bene  t: The creature gains a +2 morale bonus on attack

rolls,  weapon  damage  rolls,  touch  Armor  Class,  and  saving

throws when  ghting a beholderkin.

Special: If the creature is a true beholder, the bene ts of this

feat apply to other true beholders as well as to beholderkin.

DISINTEGRATION FINESSE

A creature with this feat can use disintegrate effects to affect

smaller, more exacting areas.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, ability to cast disintegrate as a spell

or use it as a spell-like or supernatural ability.

Bene  t: When the creature uses disintegrate on a target, it

can elect to disintegrate only portions of the target. Against

living targets, it still does the normal amount of damage, but

any parts of the target it wishes to spare remain unaffected by

the spell. The creature could, for example, disintegrate only

a  targets  skeleton,  leaving  its  skull  untouched.  It  also  can

voluntarily reduce the amount of damage dealt.

Against nonliving targets, the creature can use disintegrate

to sculpt and reshape the object in any manner desired, as long

as the result is no larger in volume or size than the original

object.  The  quality  of  the  result  is  determined  by  a  Craft

(sculpting) check.

Normal: A disintegrate effect destroys all of a slain creature,

Special:  The  creature  cannot  use  this  ability  with  a

metamagic feat that would increase the level of a spell by more

than three levels.

an entire object, or one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter.

Special: If your campaign uses the Damage to Speci c Areas

variant rule on page 27 of the Dungeon Masters Guide, a creature

with this feat can disintegrate a single part of a targets body,

such as its hand, arm, head, eyes, ears, feet, legs, and so on, as

long as the target is not killed outright by the damage caused

by the spell.

DISJUNCTION RAY

A beholder with this feat can narrow its antimagic cone down

to an eye ray that disjoins magic.

Prerequisites: Cha 19, Focused Antimagic, beholder with

functional antimagic ability.

Bene  t: As a standard action, the creature can reduce the

cone-shaped area of effect of its central eyes antimagic cone

down to a razor-thin eye ray. If the creature hits a magical effect

or magic item with this narrowed eye ray, it disjoins the effect

or item as if it had cast Mordenkainens disjunction on the effect

or item.

Beholders  avoid  using  this  narrowed  ray  on  magic  items

since the destruction of a magic item also destroys a potential

source of magic that could be used to charge their dweomer-

lobes.

FOCUSED ANTIMAGIC

A beholder with this feat can focus the antimagic of its central

eye to target a single person or object.

Prerequisite: Beholder with functional antimagic ability.

Bene  t: The creature can reduce the cone-shaped area of

effect of its central eye to target a single creature or object. The

target must be within range of its normal cone-shaped effect

(150 feet).

METARAY

A beholder with this feat can apply the effects of metamagic

feats to its eye rays.

SKILLED TELEKINETIC

A  creature  with  this  feat  becomes  so  skilled  with  its  teleki-

nesis ability that it can manipulate and use magic items via

telekinesis.

Prerequisite: Ability to use telekinesis as a supernatural

ability.

Bene  t: As a standard action, the creature can use its tele-

kinetic power to trigger a command word, spell completion,

or spell trigger magic item as long as the item is unattended

and the creature would normally utilize the item when hold-

ing it. The magic item must be within reach of the creatures

telekinesis ability, the creature must have line of sight with its

target, and the creature must have line of effect between the

magic  item  and  the  target.  The  item  must  otherwise  ful ll

all the requirements for manipulating an object via telekinesis

(such as weight).

BEHOLDER MAGIC

Although  they  are  naturally  potent  adversaries,  beholders

understand the value of augmenting their capabilities with

additional magic. Yet beholders are not known for their skill

or even their interest in creating magic items. Therefore, most

of a beholders magic gear has been stolen from others.

Since most magic items are crafted by humanoids, a beholder

cannot use all of the items it  nds. Still, it hoards weapons,

armor, cloaks, boots, gauntlets, and similar magic items so it

can study them to charge its dweomerlobes.

A creature with a beholder-shaped body can wear the fol-

lowing magic items:

One headband, hat, or phylactery on the body. A beholder

can only wear a helmet specially designed to  t over the

creatures entire body.

Three pairs of eye lenses or goggles over the central eye and

Prerequisites: True beholder or beholderkin, at least one

up to two eyestalks (one pair per eye or eyestalk).

metamagic feat.

Bene  t: Once per round, as a standard action, the creature

can enhance one of its eye rays with the effect of a metamagic

feat that it possesses. Enhancing an eye ray in this manner

burns the eyestalk out for a number of rounds equal to the

amount by which the metamagic would normally increase a

spell level. Since  ring an eye ray that hasnt been enhanced

with metamagic is a free action, the creature still can use its

other eye rays in a round in which it enhances one ray with

metamagic.

For  example,  if  a  beholder  had  the  Maximize  Spell  feat

and the Metaray feat, it could take a standard action to  re a

maximized in ict moderate wounds eye ray that would cause

26  points  of  damage  on  a  hit.  Its  in ict  moderate  wounds

eyestalk would then not be usable for the next 3 rounds.

Three amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts,

or scarabs on up to three eyestalks (one item per eyestalk).

One belt worn about an eyestalk.

One pair of bracers or bracelets on a pair of eyestalks.

Up  to  three  rings  on  up  to  three  eyestalks  (one  ring  per

eyestalk).

Beholders  cannot  wear  vests,  vestments,  shirts,  robes,  suits

of armor, cloaks, capes, mantles, gloves, gauntlets, boots, or

shoes.

Beholder mages and elder orbs are exceptions to the rule

that beholders do not create magic items. Some of the items

fashioned by these powerful creatures are among the treasures

sought after by their lesser kin and adventurers alike.

ray chaining is enhanced so that it jumps from the initial target

to a second target within range of the users actual location. If

the ray misses its initial target, it does not jump to a new target.

A spellcaster can use a lens of ray chaining as an additional focus

component to chain a ray spell as long as he holds the lens in

one hand. A lens of ray chaining shatters into ruin after it is used

nine times.

Lens of Ray Doubling: This magic lens functions as a lens

of ray chaining, except that it instead splits any ray shot through

Lens  of  Ray  Widening:  This  magic  lens  functions  as  a

lens of ray chaining, except that it instead widens any ray shot

through it into a cone-shaped effect. The user no longer rolls

to hit a target with the ray. Instead, any creatures caught in

the cone-shaped area must make a DC 15 Re ex save to avoid

the effect of the ray entirely. Each target in the area that fails

to save is affected as if struck fully by the ray. This widening

magic dilutes the original strength of the ray; creatures affected

by the cone gain a +2 bonus on any saving throws made to

resist or negate the actual effect of the ray. When widened,

rays that normally affect objects (such as a disintegrate ray)

now affect only creatures, unless the ray deals some form of

energy damage, in which case objects automatically make their

saving throw against the damage caused by the attack.

Mouthpick Weapon: Although most beholders are content

with the vast power afforded by their eye rays and antimagic

cone, some revel in the act of melee combat and enjoy the sensa-

tion of crushing bone and cutting  esh. For these beholders,

a mouthpick weapon is a valued treasure indeed.

Mouthpick  is  a  weapon  quality  that  can  be  added  to  any

melee  weapon.  The  weapon  must  be  of  a  size  the  beholder

would normally use, or it takes a penalty for using an awk-

wardly sized weapon. Mouthpick weapons are of Large size.

Only creatures with a natural bite attack can wield a mouth-

pick weapon. A mouthpick weapon looks similar to a normal

weapon, but when a qualifying creature places the handle of

the weapon in its mouth, the handle writhes and transforms

into a shape that can be wielded easily in the creatures jaws.

The creatures natural bite attack is now replaced by the weapon

attack;  if  the  creature  has  a  suf ciently  high  base  attack,  it

can even gain additional attacks with the mouthpick weapon.

While wielded in a creatures mouth, the weapon automatically

grants the creature pro ciency in its use.

Recently,  mouthpick  weapons  have  begun  to  gain  favor

among other creatures that lack hands but have a natural bite

attack.  They  are  particularly  useful  to  druids  who  wish  to

continue wielding their favorite weapon while in a wild shape

form.

Sphere Mirror: This large pane of glass measures 10 feet

tall by 5 feet wide. The items name, which seems at odds with

its rectangular shape, actually refers to the spherical shape of

a beholders body.

The glass surface of the mirror does not re ect light, and,

viewed under normal circumstances, it seems like little more

than an empty metal frame. The magic of the glass perfectly

re ects the image of any beholder that looks into it, up to a

range of 60 feet. The image is so perfect that it is very likely to

be mistaken for a live beholder; a DC 30 Spot check reveals the

truth but offers no additional protection from the beholders

eye rays.

A beholder can re ect and amplify any of its eye rays off the

surface of the mirror, effectively  ring the ray from the location

of the mirror rather than from its eye. The beholder needs line

of sight to the mirror, but not line of effect. If it  res a ray at

an object it cannot see from its actual location or the mirrors

location, the target gains the bene t of total concealment. It

is possible for a beholder to redirect its eye ray attacks around

numerous corners if multiple sphere mirrors are used, as long

as no two mirrors are more than 60 feet apart. A beholder must

use a standard action to focus on a sphere mirror, and can use

only one eye ray per round when employing this magic item.

Attacks made against the beholders re ected image do not

harm the beholder, although they might damage the mirror

itself, which has hardness 10 and 30 hit points.

A beholder cannot use a sphere mirror if its central eye is

open.

BEHOLDER SOCIETY

Although beholders are dangerous, powerful creatures, one

factor  above  all  others  has  played  a  key  role  in  preventing

them from establishing dominance over large portions of the

world. Beholders are, by any de nition of the word, insane.

Spawned  from  an  insane  deity  and  spending  all  their  days

 lled  with  hate  and  wrath,  beholders  have  minds  that  are

as fragmented as any intelligence can be. This insanity does

not breed chaos; rather, it drives each beholder to adhere to a

strict pattern that forces it to consider all other forms of life

inferior and insulting.

As  a  result,  beholders  are  hateful  and  aggressive  in  their

relations with all other creatures. Ironically, it is toward other

beholders (and especially beholderkin) that this hatred is the

strongest. A beholder typically views nonbeholders as a neces-

sary evilstock to gather and command in its never-ending

quest to eradicate other beholders and their ilk. Although a

beholder is completely logical and organized in its efforts, its

goals remain insane.

RELIGION

Beholders almost never become clerics. They lack the inter-

est to devote their lives to higher powers, and in truth, their

minds simply cannot conceive of doing so. The fact that their

antimagic eye disrupts their own magic is another reason they

avoid the clerical path. Yet beholders are not atheists; they live

every moment in constant devotion to an ageless entity known

as the Great Mother.

From birth, beholders know that they came not from their

parent, who disavows them and turns on them as an enemy,

but  from  an  ancient  being  known  as  the  Great  Mother.  To

beholders, the Great Mother epitomizes the truth. All else is

imperfection, and as a result, each beholder strives to become as

perfect in mind and body as the Great Mother. Each beholder

vividly recalls its birth not as the event occurred, but as if it

had been spawned personally by the Great Mother herself.

Each  beholder  also  believes  to  the  core  of  its  being  that  it

personi es the closest approximation the  esh can hope for

in replicating the true majesty of the Great Mother. All others

are pretenders that must be destroyed, for each moment that

another beholder lives is an insult to the Great Mother. To a

beholder, there is no greater way to demonstrate its faith than

to slaughter and kill.

LANGUAGE

All beholders can speak Common, mostly so they can inter-

rogate and menace anyone they capture alive. Beholders  nd

it crude and debasing to speak in this language (or any other

nonbeholder  language),  as  if  the  mere  act  of  speaking  in

another creatures language acknowledges that races creativity

and intelligence. For this reason, beholders prefer to speak in

their own native tongue.

The language of beholders is dif cult, but not impossible,

for humanoids to understand and speak. Beholder is a guttural

language that incorporates plenty of lip-smacking, gurgling,

and slobbering. A lengthy conversation between two beholders

that dont immediately try to kill each other can quickly douse

the surrounding area with drool and worse.

Strangely, the beholder language does not include a word

for  the  name  of  their  species.  The  term  beholder  is  an

appellation granted to the race by those they deem inferior.

Each beholder  nds the idea of belonging to a beholder race

disgusting, assuming that it is a one-of-a-kind representation

of the Great Mother. On the rare occasion that one beholder

befriends another, it typically refers to the other by its own

name, perhaps the greatest way it can respect another.

Beholder  names  are  long,  complicated,  and  slobbery  to

pronounce; a beholder typically names itself within the  rst

year of its life. Sample beholder names include Blorghathus,

Gazriktak, Irixis, Ixahinon, Khuxristul, Kreskalat, Murlbal-

bluthk, Qeqtoxii, Sespetoxri, Sikrewxes, Vhalantru, Xanathar,

Zommist, and Zulnethrak. Rarely, a sane beholder that estab-

lishes itself as the leader of a guild of lesser beings adopts a

more easily pronounceable name formed in the language of

its minions. Sample names of this type include Cinderglare,

Eyebiter, Gobblegut, Manglecramps, Orbius, and Slatherjaw.

RELATIONS WITH

OTHER CREATURES

A  beholder  (sane  or  otherwise)  tends  to  place  members  of

nonbeholder species in one of  ve categories.

Powerful: The creature in question is something that the

beholder  admits  is  equally  powerful  or  even  more  powerful

than itself. This category is by far the smallest, and beholders

avoid these creatures completely rather than confront them.

Examples include storm giants, outsiders with more than 16 Hit

Dice, powerful liches or vampires, most dragons, and deities.

Dangerous:  This  category  includes  creatures  that  the

beholder  admits  can  cause  it  grievous  injury  or  disrupt  its

carefully  laid  plans.  These  creatures  have  information  that

a  beholder  needs  or  access  to  items  it  covets,  and  thus  the

beholder seeks to capture, subjugate, and eventually destroy

the  creature  as  ef ciently  as  possible.  Examples  include

humanoids,  intelligent  undead,  mind   ayers,  aboleths,  and

outsiders with 12 to 16 Hit Dice.

Usable: These creatures pose little threat to a beholder, but

they possess useful abilities that a beholder can bene t from if

it can charm them. Examples include goblinoids, giants, grell,

neogi, and outsiders with fewer than 12 Hit Dice.

Inferior:  These  creatures  offer  nothing  of  interest  to  a

beholder and are simply annoying. Beholders prefer to enslave

or destroy them but dont normally go out of their way to do

so.  Examples  include  elementals,  nonintelligent  undead,

constructs, fey, vermin, and sentient plants.

Inconsequential:  These  creatures  offer  nothing  to  a

beholder but a convenient source of food. Examples include

animals and magical beasts.

Relations with Other Beholders

A beholders typical reaction to encountering another beholder

is rage. If possible, the beholder directs its minions to attack

the other beholder and kill it, but sometimes this tactic isnt

the best one available. In such a case, the beholder is driven

to attack the other beholder personally.

Of all creatures, a beholder is perhaps the most invulner-

able to others of its kind, due to its antimagic cone. A combat

between two beholders is savage and ruthless, especially if the

terrain doesnt allow one an advantage over the other. A beholder

that is able to ambush another can end the  ght quickly.

When two beholders meet on equal ground, each rotates

quickly enough to keep its enemy in the area of its antimagic

cone. Thus, the encounter rapidly degenerates into a frenzied

battle of  ashing teeth and tearing  esh. Each beholder uses

Flyby  Attack  to  swoop  in,  bite  its  enemy,  and  then  retreat

to a point where its foe cannot escape its cone of antimagic

with a single move action, forcing the foe to take two moves

to escape the antimagic or retaliate in a similar swoop-bite-

retreat tactic. Sometimes, a beholder can use the surrounding

terrain to turn the tide of battle in its favor by using its eye

rays to attack its enemy indirectly. For example, a beholder

could use disintegrate rays to drop trees or cave in a roof on

an enemy, or it could use its telekinesis eye ray to hurl objects

at its enemy. (If the beholder uses the violent thrust form of

telekinesisthat  is,  using  magic  only  to  launch  the  object,

which thereafter moves of its own accord as if it had been

thrownthe object maintains its velocity and trajectory even

after it enters an antimagic cone.)

In the exceedingly rare cases where more than two behold-

ers meet, the resulting melee is proportionally more savage

and destructive. Beholders in such a  ght team up against the

one that looks the most unusual. The beholders form groups

based on their similar physical features and work together

to  nullify  the  others.  As  each  beholder  falls,  the  groups

reorganize so that the next most unique-looking beholder is

the common target.

SANE BEHOLDERS

Not all beholders are insane, solitary creatures with little more

on their minds than slaughter. Just as other races have members

who simply cant abide by the rules of their society, so too do

beholders have outcasts. From a humanoid viewpoint, these

outcasts are the few sane beholders. These creatures maintain a

hatred of other beholders, but this is a hatred born of fear rather

than intolerance. A sane beholder understands that others of its

kind view it as the greatest threat of all, and it seeks out places

that other beholders shun. In other words, these beholders live

in the societies and cities of other races.

Although these beholders might be considered sane, most

remain evil to the core. They know that they are objects of

fear to other races and take pains to establish their lairs in

secret underground chambers below a city. They make use

of their charm person and charm monster eye rays to build

a  small  army  of  loyal  minions  from  the  local  population,

and before long, they establish themselves as the shadowy

leaders  of  new  organizations.  Many  of  these  groups  func-

tion as thieves guilds, with the beholder running the show

behind  the  scenes  or  through  a  carefully  selected  proxy.

Other  beholder-driven  groups  might  include  religious

organizations, bard colleges, wizardly schools, or even the

government of a small city.

The most common form of organization, of course, is the

beholder  cult.  These  cults  consist  of  a  single  beholder  that

charms  a  number  of  minions,  who  then  take  to  worshiping

the beholder as a deity. Beholders  nd that being worshiped

is an excellent path to self-satisfaction and delight, and they

encourage such behavior in their minions. In many cases, a

beholder keeps only a few select cult leaders charmed, and

these leaders guide and in uence the main body of the cult.

That  way,  cult  members  worship  the  beholder  voluntarily,

without being coerced into doing so by magic, which beholders

 nd most rewarding.

Some beholder cultists go so far as to gouge out a portion of

their own forehead and graft in a beholders eye during a foul

ritual dedicated to the Great Mother. These people become

clerics of the Great Mother, after a fashion, even though they

themselves are not beholders. Known as ocular adepts, they

represent  the  most  devoted,  and  thus  most  dangerous,  of

beholder cultists. Often, an ocular adept runs an entire cult

and is allied with a beholder that might not live nearby at all.

In some cases, a dozen or more ocular adepts based in as many

cities might all follow the same beholder. The beholder selects

the location of the most powerful cult as a base of operations

and rules the other branches by proxy. The ocular adept is

detailed in full in the FORGOTTEN REALMS supplement Faiths

& Pantheons, but a sample ocular adept appears in the Cult

of the Hungry Eye adventure at the end of this chapter.

In rare circumstances, sane beholders pool their resources

and work together to accomplish a common goal. Such a group-

ing of beholders is called a beholder cluster and consists of

anywhere from two to six of the creatures. Because beholders

are asexual and have little need for physical companionship,

these clusters are almost always focused on dominating inferior

races or gathering new magic sources for study. A beholder

cluster becomes the prevailing force in the region and, if left

alone, can eventually challenge the rule of nations.

Even beholder clusters do not represent the most dangerous

aspect of beholder society. For this, one need look no further

than the dreaded beholder hives.

HIVES AND HIVE CITIES

One of the most terrifying manifestations of beholder society is

a beholder hive. It is not unheard of for similarly shaped behold-

ers to live in close proximity to one another, cooperating to build

incredible and alien cities in the far corners of the world.

The existence of beholder hive mothers and overseers makes

these  gatherings  possible.  These  thankfully  rare  creatures

possess a supernatural ability to command and dominate other

beholders. Hive mothers are powerful beholders said to have

been spawned directly from the shuddering folds of the Great

Mother herself. Overseers are horribly mutated creatures that

only super cially resemble the original beholder stock from

which  they  sprang.  Both  can  organize  a  large  collection  of

beholders to work toward a common goal.

The appearance of a beholder hive varies wildly. Some are

little more than tangled underground mazes of chambers and

circular  passageways  carved  by  a  multitude  of  disintegrate

eye rays, while others are fantastic cities of alien, disturbing

architecture. These hive cities are built by charmed minions,

with  nishing touches by particularly artistic beholders that

use their disintegrate eye rays to carve sculptures from solid

stone or metal.

A  beholder  hives  population  depends  on  the  nature  of

its leader. An overseer can command only a relatively small

number  of  beholders  at  once,  and  thus  its  hive  consists  of

only twenty or so beholders and beholderkin. These hives are

typically underground warrens.

A hive ruled by a hive mother, on the other hand, has no limit

to its size. Such a hive usually even incorporates a few overseers

(all under the hive mothers control, of course). These hives are

more on the scale of cities, and although they are often found

in underground regions, a rare few appear in remote regions

on the surface. The primary goal of a hive mother that rules

a hive city is almost always the collection of other beholders

and beholderkin; hive mothers believe that they themselves

are the chosen of the Great Mother and must work to bring

unity and order to the beholder race. Other beholder cities

ruled by rival hive mothers are their greatest enemies, for they

represent all that is tainted and wrong about the beholder race.

Once  all  other  hive  cities  are  destroyed  or  assimilated,  the

surviving hive mother can turn its vast resources to the other

races of the world and begin the  nal cleansing to prepare for

the Great Mothers return.

A typical hive city has a population that breaks down roughly

as follows:

1 hive mother

2 to 4 overseer beholderkin

6 to 12 director beholderkin (each with a bonded vermin

mount, usually Huge monstrous centipedes)

11 to 30 beholders

5 to 15 gauths

3 to 8 beholderkin guardians (death kisses or gougers)

12 to 24 gas spores (see page 148), used almost like traps at

the outer city perimeters

30 to 120 charmed minions (these can be of any of the races

that are dominant in the region)

Of course, these numbers represent only the average popula-

tion of a hive city. Particularly massive hive cities are reputed to

be located in the deepest underground reaches or the farthest

corners of the world.

Life  for  a  beholder  in  a  hive  city  is  an  unusual  prospect.

The  hive  mother  knows  at  all  times  where  its  commanded

minions are, and even if this command is disrupted (by the

antimagic eye of another beholder, for example), the beholders

do their best to maintain a civil air, for to disrupt the city is to

invite the terrible wrath of its ruler. Yet even a hive mother is

incapable of directing an entire hive. It allows favored behold-

ers or overseers to rule its city as a council of sorts. All city

activities are directed by this council, and the hive mother

WHY DONT BEHOLDERS DISINTEGRATE THE WORLD?

This question has haunted sages and adventurers, in particular

the famed half-elf scholar Odiit Tenrest. In his famous speech

about  beholders,  delivered  to  students  in  the  Mages  Guild

some years ago, Tenrest put forth his theories on the matter.

Tenrest  wondered  why  these  horribly  powerful  creatures,

capable of using great magic virtually at will, havent used these

abilities in a more obvious show of force. Sure, beholders are

more concerned with fighting others of their kind, but certainly

there must be at least a few that would use their disintegrate

eye ray to try to destroy the world, one 10-foot cube at a time.

His  answer  lay  in  the  mindset  of  the  beholder.  Although

typically  insane  with  xenophobia,  beholders  are  also  incred-

ibly arrogant and vain, and nothing pleases them more than

to  have  other  creatures  fawn  over  them  and  worship  them,

bolstering their own overinflated egos. A beholder that runs

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

amok  with  disintegrate  and finger  of  death  eye  rays  quickly

finds  itself  without  anyone  to  dominate  and  menace.  Thus,

beholders  use  self-control  to  avoid  destroying  everything

around them, simply to keep something nearby to give them

a  sense  of  power.  Without  a  matrix  of  fearful  worshipers,  a

beholder could not exist.

When several students challenged him on this theory, Ten-

rest simply smiled and told them to trust his sources. Newer

students wrote him off as a lunatic, but older students were

not so quick to ignore him. They knew that Tenrest spent much

of  his  time  exploring  the  depths  of  the  Guild  Library,  and,

according  to  rumor,  the  forbidden  depths  were  themselves

patrolled by beholdersinvisible beholders, which might have

whispered advice into old Tenrests ears, telling him what he

wanted to hear. . . .

itself simply observes them rather than watching the entire

city as a whole.

Of course, the multiverse is in nite, so some beholder hive

cities across the planes conform to other rules. Three examples

of alternate beholder hive cities are described below.

In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, located deep below the

desert Anauroch in a great bell-shaped cavern, lies the city

of  Ooltul.  Nearly  450  beholders  and  beholder  mages  live

here in peace, without the presence of a single hive mother

or overseer. Their hatred is held in check by an even more

ancient and more powerful race that has hidden plans for

the city.

In a remote corner of an unknown world on the Material

Plane  lies  the  massive  beholder  hive  city  of  Kaggash.  This

surface city is of unprecedented size, with a beholder popu-

lation  of  about  two  thousand,  and  is  located  on  a  volcanic,

mist-shrouded island. Rumor holds that ten or possibly more

allied hive mothers jointly rule Kaggash.

Somewhere on the cold, barren slopes of Mungoth, the third

layer of Gehenna, looms the beholder hive-tower of Uldinath.

This  massive  spire  is  honeycombed  with

tunnels and is home to a hive of nearly three

hundred half- end director beholderkin

bonded to bonespears (Fiend Folio page

24). Uldinath is ruled by Tchkarthu,

a half- end elder orb and 20th-level sor-

cerer. Tchkarthu desires to gain the power

to command beholders as a hive mother

does, and given its resources, it might

The beholder hive city Kaggash

just  nd what it seeks.

LAIRS

A  typical  beholder  lair

consists of a winding maze

of  passageways  bored

through solid rock with

disintegrate  eye  rays.

These tunnels tend to

be  perfectly  smooth

and round, with a 10-

foot radius. Beholders

know that their ability

to   y  gives  them  a  dis-

tinct tactical advantage,

so most lairs incorporate

a large number of vertical

shafts. This hinders intrud-

ers attempting to penetrate

the  lair  and  keeps  prisoners

from easily escaping.

A  typical  lair  consists  of  three

to   ve  additional  chambers.  The  far-

thest  chamber  from  the  entrance  is  the

beholders  personal  quarters,  where  the

creature  sleeps  and  studies  any  magic

treasure it has accumulated. Beholders are

too arrogant to incorporate escape tunnels

into their quarters; doing so only invites an

invasion  on  multiple  fronts.  In  any  case,

a  beholder  can  quickly  create  its  own

escape  tunnel,  if  need  be,  with  its

disintegrate  eye  ray.  Between  the

quarters  and  the  lair  entrance  are  two  or  more  chambers

used to house guardians. Most beholders keep another room

off to the side of the main complex to dispose of waste or to

hold prisoners. A beholder with a favored minion (such as

a  representative,  see  below)  allows  that  minion  his  or  her

own  chamber  as  well.  Additional  chambers  for  additional

minions are built as needed. Beholders are quite fond of traps,

especially those triggered by pressure plates (which they can

easily  oat over), and they incorporate pit traps and similar

protections into their lairs.

MINIONS

Although beholders are tremendously xenophobic, they can

reign in their fears and intolerance when faced with a creature

that they might be able to use for a time before killing it. A

beholder never trusts bargains when recruiting a minion.

Instead, it uses its charm person or charm monster eyes to magi-

cally control the creature. A beholder is careful to renew any

charms it has on its minions as needed, setting aside the waking

hours of the day for such tasks.

Beholders keep minions for many reasons, the most common

of  which  are  detailed  below.  Beholders  normally  never  use

beholderkin  as  minionstheyd  rather  simply  disintegrate

them. Exceptions exist among those that are sane or that have

been commanded to employ such minions by an overseer or

hive mother.

Assassins:  Beholders  invent  complicated  schemes  and

plans that can go awry when other creatures meddle in their

affairs. When a beholders plan is foiled, it uses its spies to

 nd out what happened. If it learns that a speci c creature

or  group  of  creatures  is  responsible,  it  sends  assassins  to

remedy the situation. Only if all of its assassins fail to kill

the troublemakers does a beholder get personally involved.

In such a case, it prefers to use its spies or gatherers to lure

the creatures to its lair, where it has the advantage, and then

use all of its resources to  nish the job. Example assassins:

assassins, chokers, derro, doppelgangers, driders, rogues.

Entertainment:  Although  beholders  spend  much  of

their  time  studying  magic,  plotting,  and  bullying  other

minions, most keep at least a few minions on hand solely for

entertainment purposes. Entertainment to a beholder can

range wildly according to personal tastes, from the sadistic

glee derived from watching cowering goblins forced to  ght

each other under threat of petri cation and disintegration to

the more cultured displays of magical prowess from charmed

spellcasters. Beholders particularly enjoy watching illusions,

but observing any magical display by an entertaining minion

can  also  help  charge  the  creatures  dweomerlobes.  Of  all

minions, entertainers are the ones most likely to be eaten at

a moments notice. Example entertainers: bards, goblinoids,

sorcerers, wizards.

Gatherers:  Beholders  prefer  to  remain  in  their  lairs,

surrounded by their guardians and defenses, but they need

items that can be procured only from the world outside. In

these cases, a beholder employs charmed gathererscreatures

capable of traversing great distances quickly and penetrating

secure sites with ease. A beholder sends a spy to determine

the  probable  location  of  an  object  or  person  it  needs,  and

then sends a gatherer to  nish the job. Gatherers are used

to catch new prisoners, although for particularly dangerous

missions,  a  beholder  sends  a  combined  force  of  assassins

and gatherers. Example gatherers: ethereal  lchers, mephits,

rangers, wizards.

Guardians:  The  majority  of  a  beholders  minions  are

guardians, creatures selected to protect the lair. Unintelligent

guardians are left to squat in dead-end sections of the lair,

while more intelligent minions patrol the lair and look for

intruders.

Gas  spores  (see  page  148)  deserve  special  mention.  This

unique airborne form of fungus was originally cultivated and

shaped by an ancient beholder mage whose name has long

since been forgotten. In the gas spore, the beholder managed

to create a dangerous yet mindless guardian that served as a

form  of  living  sculpture  to  honor  and  venerate  the  classic

beholder form, was fecund and self-propagating, and required

little to no outside maintenance. Gas spores never rebelled

against their masters, never attacked a beholder by accident,

and couldnt be reasoned with or charmed away by an enemy.

Since their creation, gas spores have taken to the far corners

of the world like a plague, and dungeons that were once under

the rule of a beholder lord that moved on or perished still

serve as breeding grounds for these terrible fungi. Example

guardians:  athachs,  barbarians,  bulettes,  carrion  crawlers,

dire animals,  ghters, gas spores, giants, hydras, minotaurs,

ogres, purple worms, ropers.

Representatives: Rarely, a beholder needs to interact with

another  society  or  civilization  in  a  nonviolent  manner.  A

beholder put in this unenviable position relies on a charmed

representative with a high Charisma score. Beholders treat

their representatives much better than they treat their other

minions, and even though representatives remain charmed,

they are afforded the best personal quarters in the lair and

are allowed to keep a fair amount of wealth and comforts.

Beholders do this because, of all their minions, representa-

tives are the most likely to be discovered and rescued by

interlopers who dispel the charm. Often, a representative that

is no longer charmed remains loyal to his beholder, thanks

to the preferential treatment that he has received. Beholders

keep only one representative, since they  nd treating other

creatures as near-equals to be painful. Example representa-

tives: bards, ogre mages, sorcerers, wizards.

Spies:  Spies  serve  a  similar  role  to  that  of  gatherers,

except that gatherers are sent to collect people and objects,

whereas spies are used purely to observe the lands  around

the beholders lair. A spy typically remains in the  eld for a

week, returning to the lair well before the charm monster ray

wears off to report his or her  ndings. Example spies: cloakers,

kobolds, mephits, rangers, rogues, water nagas.

SEKARVUS LAIR

Sekarvu is a typical beholder. It spent much of its youth explor-

ing underground realms and killing everything it found. One

day, it came upon a large cavern  lled with violet fungi. At the

edge of the cavern, it found a small band of adventurers who

had all but succumbed to the toxins of the fungis tendrils.

They offered little resistance to Sekarvu as it approached and

began to feed on their still-writhing bodies. With its  rst bite,

the beholders life changed forever.

The feeble struggling of each victim it consumed was rapture

to Sekarvu. It quickly ate the bodies of the adventurers, and

Sekarvu spent the next several months charming monsters and

bringing them back to the cavern for food preparation. When

Sekarvu tried this tactic with a well-armed band of svirfneblin

explorers, though, its taste for fungi-tainted  esh nearly cost

the beholder its life.

After escaping, Sekarvu decided to build an underground

lair where it could raise a farm of violet fungi and to which it

could lure new food with ease. It wanted to maintain terrain

advantages over any victims that proved especially dif cult

to eat. The beholder found the perfect site at the base of the

Skitterrift, a narrow but deep subterranean gorge  lled with

monstrous  centipedes.  Sekarvu  spent  several  days  killing

the centipedes before settling in. Since then, it has charmed

a  gnome  illusionist  named  Ilirik  Jadewhisper,  whose  map-

making skills have proven quite a boon in luring would-be

treasure-seekers to their doom.

ADVENTURE HOOK

The best way to lure the PCs to Sekarvus lair is for them to

discover one of the false treasure maps that Ilirik has prepared

and scattered throughout the region. The map shows the best

underground route from a fairly well-known surface entrance

to what is reputed to be the lair of a powerful medusa. The

map shows areas 1 and 2 of the lair, but it doesnt show the

passageway leading south from area 2. It also indicates that

the medusa lives in area 2 and that she has amassed a huge

mound of treasure within.

1. ENTRANCE CAVERN

This long, dry cavern is free of stalagmites and rubble. The  oor

is smooth and covered with a thick layer of pale yellow fungus.

Dozens of humanoid statues lie in a jumbled heap against the

walls. At the far end of the cavern, a 10-foot-wide circular pas-

sageway opens into the rough cavern wall.

The forty-seven statues piled along the walls of this cavern

are  indeed  petri ed  humanoids,  victims  of  Sekarvus   esh

to stone eye ray. Each statue is badly damaged and missing

suf cient parts that any victims restored to life immediately

die. If a body is resurrected, the victim can warn its rescuers

that a beholder petri ed him or her.

Characters who do not learn this information can still obtain

a clue as to the possible nature of the creature that lairs within

by studying the smooth, circular tunnel that leads to area 2. A

DC 26 Spellcraft check con rms that disintegrate spells were

used to dig the tunnel.

The tunnels of Sekarvus lair remain fairly level, except for

the numerous vertical shafts. The beholder can navigate these

easily, but it knows that its enemies and prisoners cannot. The

walls of the shafts are extremely smooth and can be climbed

only by creatures that have a climb speed, use magic, or use

a rope or similar climbing tool. A PC who uses a rope or tool

can climb a shaft with a DC 5 Climb check. The depth of each

vertical shaft is indicated on the map; the directional arrow

shows in which direction the shaft descends, and the number

indicates the shafts depth.

2. FOOD TRAP (EL 10)

This circular room glitters and shines, illuminated by  ve free-

standing torches along the edge. The  oor is hidden from view by

a veritable carpet of coinscopper, silver, gold, and even some

platinum pieces sparkle invitingly. Strewn among the coins are

the odd gemstone, necklace, ring, and work of art. A large golden

divan sits against the far wall, and lounging upon it is a  gure

with writhing hair and terrible, glowering eyes.

The majority of this rooms contentsthe coins and treasure,

the divan, and even the reclining medusaare illusions. Only

the  ve torches are real. At Sekarvus command, Ilirik placed

the illusion here with a permanent image spell (DC 22 Will

save to disbelieve).

The real threat that lurks in this room comes from the three

charmed driders that Sekarvu has guarding this chamber. These

driders cling to the ceiling 30 feet above. Once they hear the

PCs approach or spot their light sources, each drider casts invis-

ibility on itself. One then casts major image to make it seem as

if the medusa stands up to attack the intruders. The other two

driders position themselves so that one can cast a web in the

hallway to the east while the other casts major image to make

it seem as if the vertical shaft to the east has just collapsed in

a cave-in. Sekarvu has ordered the driders to catch food alive

if possible, so they use spells like ray of enfeeblement and web

to catch the PCs and suggestion to keep them from  eeing if

they escape. If the PCs look relatively healthy, the driders use

magic missiles to soften them up.

Once their spells are spent or the PCs are caught, the driders

levitate down to attack, using their bites and heavy maces to

make nonlethal attacks (taking a 4 penalty on attack rolls as

a result) and beat the intruders into submission. If their tactics

are successful, one drider skitters off to alert Sekarvu, while

the others carry the unconscious prisoners to area 5. There,

they strip the PCs of their equipment, which they leave piled

in the center of the room for Sekarvu to look over, and deposit

the characters in separate pits.

The passageway leading south from this room is hidden by an

illusory wall placed here by Ilirik (DC 20 Will save to disbelieve

if the PCs interact with the wall). Numerous other illusory walls

placed by Ilirik protect the lair, as indicated on the map.

bolt is replaced by major image.

3. DINING ROOM

This large room is empty except for a bowl-shaped depression in

the  middle  of  the   oor.  A  narrow  channel  runs  from  this  bowl

down the passageway to the southeast. The inside surface of the

bowl and the channel are stained a dark red-brown and smell of

rotten meat.

This  is  where  Sekarvu  eats  its  victims.  After  the  mess  that

resulted  from  its   rst  few  meals,  the  beholder  used  its  dis-

integrate  eye  ray  to  create  the  bowl-shaped  depression  and

channel to capture blood and other material. Once Sekarvu

 nishes eating, it uses telekinesis to sluice the remains down

the channel and into the violet fungi farm in area 4.

If the PCs manage to in ltrate the lair this far without alert-

ing Sekarvu, theres a 20% chance that the beholder is here,

eating one of the still-living prisoners from area 5.

4. THE SKITTERRIFT (EL 15)

This massive rift in the surrounding stone stretches up into the

darkness.  Below,  a  softly  shifting  and  slightly  phosphorescent

violet  mass  seems  to  writhe.  Several  ledges  protrude  from  the

edge of the rift at various heights. A thick stink of rotting meat

wafts up from below.

This large rift is where Sekarvu grows its precious violet fungi

to satisfy its hankering for fungi-tainted  esh. To prepare a

meal, the beholder uses telekinesis to lift a prisoner from a pit

in area 5, carries him out to this area, and dips him into the

fungi  below  until  hes  nearly  dead.  Sekarvu  then  retires  to

the dining room (area 4) to eat. Waste left over from the meal

is drained back into this room to feed the fungi; as a result,

the plants are particularly thick in the northeast end of the

chasm. In all, twenty-four violet fungi grow on the rift  oor.

A  cautious  party  should  be  able  to  avoid  the  hazard  these

fungi present, but anyone who comes within their reach is

in deep trouble.

The beholder is terribly protective of its fungus farm and has

posted three charmed ropers on the ledges that overlook the

bulk of the fungi. These ropers are located at the areas labeled

A, B, and C on the map (there is no roper at location D). The

ropers have been commanded not to attack the violet fungi,

driders, ethereal  lchers, Ilirik, the beholder itself, or anyone

Sekarvu accompanies, but any other creatures they spot are

fair game.

Ledges A and C are 50 feet above the rift  oor, ledge B is

20 feet above the rift  oor, and ledge D is 180 feet above the

rift  oor. Squares shaded in tan indicate a square of the rift

 oor that the ropers can attack with their strands. Ropers A

and C can attack any adjacent square on the rift  oor (these

squares are colored a darker shade of tan). Since roper B is 30

feet closer, it can reach any target in any of the shaded squares.

The rifts ceiling stretches nearly 400 feet up, but there are

no  other  exits  from  the  chamber  larger  than  a  few  inches

in diameter.

The ropers have no treasure, nor is there anything of value

hidden in the mulch below the violet fungi.

5. PANTRY (EL 8)

This large chamber is ringed by six 10-foot-wide pits. Stacked in

the center of the room are six large wooden discs, reinforced with

bands  of  metal.  Several  1-inch-wide  holes  are  drilled  into  the

center of each disc.

Sekarvu keeps its captives here, trapping no more than one

creature  per  pit  if  possible.  Each  pit  is  50  feet  deep,  so  the

beholder can observe the contents of the pit with its darkvision.

The walls of each pit are smooth and cannot be climbed by

creatures  without  a  natural  climb  speed.  The  wooden  and

metal discs in the middle of the room are lids; each weighs

300 pounds. Whenever Sekarvu drops a prisoner into a pit, it

uses telekinesis to move a lid and cap the opening.

When the PCs reach this area, they might  nd prisoners in

the pitsperhaps someone theyve been looking for or charac-

ters caught by the driders in area 2. As a general rule, Sekarvu

keeps prisoners in a pit for only one or two days before eating

them, since to keep them any longer requires the beholder to

feed them. In the rare cases where it wishes to keep a prisoner

alive, either Ilirik or the denizens of this room provide food

and water as necessary.

Sekarvu has managed to charm  ve ethereal  lchers, and

these creatures stay here as guards when not out on duty. Their

ability to ethereally jaunt makes them valuable gatherers for the

beholder, which sends them out to distribute more of Iliriks

false treasure maps or to gather food and water for the other

creatures in the lair.

6. ILIRIKS QUARTERS (EL 11)

A  single  freestanding  torch  leaning  against  the  west  wall  inef-

fectively lights this chamber. The contents of the room include

a single bed, a desk and chair, and a large barrel that seems to

contain water.

This is the home of Ilirik, the illusionist Sekarvu charmed

several years ago. Iliriks long servitude to the beholder has left

him a hollow, joyless gnome who spends his free time studying

magic  and  slowly  researching  new  spells.  Sekarvu  collects

these notes on new spells as they are completed, promising to

keep them safe and return them when the gnomes servitude

to the beholder ends sometime in the future.

In truth, Sekarvu uses Ilirik as a constant source of new

magical  writings  to  observe  and  absorb.  It  also  uses  the

gnome to shore up the defenses of the lair with illusions, and

as an envoy on the rare occasions that it needs

a  humanoid  representative  with  which  to

conduct business.

Ilirik  is  encountered  here

unless  the  beholder  has  com-

manded  him  to  aid  in  the

defense of the lair elsewhere.

If  caught  alone  in  this

room, he panics. He knows

that  if  Sekarvu  discov-

ers  that  intruders  have

penetrated this far into

the lair, he will never

see his spell research

again (at best) and will

be  eaten  (at  worst).

Thus, he does his best

to   ght  the  PCs.  If  it

looks like the PCs are

about  to  defeat  him,

his  last  act  is  to  seal

off  the  northeastern

passageway  with  a

wall of stone. Sekarvu

will be able to escape

at any time with its dis-

integrate  eye  ray,  and

hopefully  the  wall  of

stone can slow the PCs

down  long  enough

for  the  beholder  to

get away.

If  the  charm  per-

son effect  on  Ilirik  is

dispelled,  his  atti-

tude  changes  from

unfriendly  to  in-

different,  and

the gnome is in-

clined  to  flee  the

scene.  He  doesnt

think  that  Sekarvu

can be beaten, and he

 gures his best hope

to  avoid  death  or

reenslavement

is to run far and

fast.  He  does  not

stay  to  help  the  PCs

unless he is awed by a

show of competence and con -

dence or persuaded with skillful

diplomacy.

7. SEKARVUS INNERMOST VAULT

(EL 15)

This  large  chamber  is  quite  impressive;  the  walls  and  ceiling

are covered with intricate carvings depicting beholders eating

humanoids,  and  vast   elds  of  mushrooms  with  writhing  ten-

drils.  On  the  ceiling  above,  the  image  of  a  single  immense

beholder  watches  everything.  Two  large,  uneven  stalagmites

protrude  from  the   oor  along  the  northeastern  wall,  and  to

the south stand several well-made statues of powerful-looking

adventurers and fearsome monsters. In the center of the room

sit numerous desks, each of which is covered with mounds of

papers and books.

This chamber is Sekarvus personal lair, and where it spends

the majority of its time. If the PCs have not yet encountered

the beholder, they  nd it here.

Sekarvu keeps an additional pair of charmed ropers here as

guardians; these are the two stalagmites to the northeast.

Their positions allow them to attack anywhere in the room

with their strands. In addition, Sekarvu defends its lair with

ferocious rage. The prospect of defeat is as alien to it as is the

concept of friendship, and it  ghts to the death.

The tables in the center of the room are covered with Iliriks

spell research notes from the past several years. Sekarvu spends

much of its time studying these notes and basking in the magic

they represent. The DM can place any number of new, unusual,

or unique arcane illusion spells in this mass of notes.

The statues to the south are the remains of creatures petri-

 ed by the beholder. None of the statues retains its original

form, though, for Sekarvu has used its disintegrate eye ray on

them to sculpt them into  ner poses or to change their faces

to look more like its own visage. If any of these bodies are

restored to  esh, they die immediately. If a creature is raised,

its personality, statistics, and purpose are left to the DM.

The southernmost statue, a hal ing with a large central eye

for a face, sits over a small hollow in the ground (Search DC 25

to discover). The PCs must move the 300-pound statue before

they  can  investigate  the  hollow,  which  contains  Sekarvus

treasure. Inside the hole is 8,025 gp, 521 pp, 15 gems (worth a

total of 5,510 gp), a bottle of air, a +1 bastard sword, a pair of boots

of the winterlands, pipes of haunting, and a sword of subtlety.

Sekarvus feats and skills are slightly different than those of a

standard beholder, as detailed below.

CULT OF THE HUNGRY EYE

Akeni  was  born  a  servant  to  a  powerful  drow  family  deep

underground, but her personality was anything but servile.

When  she  was  caught  in  an  affair  with  the  house  matrons

mate, she killed the matron and her own paramour and  ed,

eventually stumbling into the lair of a powerful beholder mage

named Ormathulak. Akeni knew immediately that the creature

was just the ally she needed to wipe out her hated family.

Ormathulak found her dif cult to charm, but just as it was

about to kill and eat her instead, the drow pledged her loyalty

to  the  beholder  in  return  for  its  support.  Ormathulak  was

impressed with her bravery and imperious attitude and agreed

on one condition: She must submit to the test of the Hungry

Eye. Akeni agreed, and after a grueling 20 hours of torture

and grafting, she emerged with a beholders eye grafted to her

forehead and a newfound adoration for both Ormathulak and

the Great Mother. Ormathulak promised to help her destroy

her familys house if she would  rst aid the beholder in the

creation of a large network of cult bases on the surface. Akeni

agreed  and  set  out  for  the  surface  world  without  a  second

thought.

She took the  rst three letters of her patrons name as her

surname and has since established no fewer than nine beholder

cults. She left each cult in the care of a charismatic individual

whod been fully brainwashed and converted to her cause. Her

tenth cult is nearing completion and is based in the Lost Gull,

a roadside tavern perched atop a sea cliff. Akeni has converted

the owners of the tavern along with most of its regular patrons,

but none of them are charismatic enough to serve as a proxy

leader. As soon as she  nds her proxy, though, she plans to

return to Ormathulak to report her success.

ADVENTURE HOOK

The PCs can become involved in the machinations of the Cult

of the Hungry Eye in many ways. They might simply stop at

the Lost Gull for a drink, or they might arrive seeking a regular

patron who hasnt come home for several days. Akeni takes note

of any charismatic PC and tries to kidnap him or her and use

her magic to convert that character to her cause.

As  the  PCs  approach  the  tavern,  read  or  paraphrase  the

following description.

A large building stands at the side of the road ahead. It appears

to be a tavern, with a dome-shaped roof and a two-story tower

attached to the far side. A newer extension, apparently a stable,

juts off to the  east of  the main  building, but the  stable  doors

are  boarded  over  and  a  sign  has  been  nailed  over  the  boards.

Several posts to tie up horses have been placed recently along

the stables northern side. A sweeping arc of wooden steps leads

up to the main entrance, over which swings a sign depicting a

ravenous sea gull tearing into a dead  sh.

The doors into the stable were boarded up by Akeni because

the stables serve as temporary barracks for the cultists. The

sign on the boards reads: Stables closed for repair. Please hitch

horses here and come inside to get stablehands.

1. COMMON ROOM

(EL 12, 15 IF AKENI IS PRESENT)

The main entrance is at the north end of the common room.

The  air  in  this  large  room  is  thick  with  a  strange  but  rather

pleasant smoke. Several tables are occupied by patrons. The

place  is  relaxed  and  quiet,  and  none  of  the  customers  seem

willing to break the mood with conversation or games, appar-

ently  content  to  sit  and  drink.  Several  windows,  sooty  and

dif cult  to  see  through,  line  the  wall  to  the  west,  and  a  bar

sits to the south.

The door exiting the inn to the south is kept locked; the key

is hidden on a nearby shelf and can be found with a DC 25

Search check. The lock itself is of good quality and can be

picked with a DC 30 Open Lock check.

All of the patrons found here, as well as the two serving

girls and the matronly barkeep, are members of the Cult of the

Hungry Eye. They take a passing interest in anyone who enters

the tavern, and one of the serving girls invites the visitors to

sit at the table farthest from the exit while the other quietly

slips out of the room to alert Akeni of the new arrivals. The

cultists remain calm and put on a relaxed air, waiting for the

smoke or the food and drink to do most of the work. Each table

(except for the one the serving girl leads the PCs to) has a pair

of light crossbows and ten bolts cleverly hidden in a hollow

underneath the surface. A character who simply walks by a

table notices the hidden crossbows with a DC 35 Spot check;

if the character actually sits at one of these tables, he gains a +4

circumstance bonus on the check. Characters who are smaller

than Medium size also gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the

check.

The smoke in the air is actually a diluted form of insanity

mist that Akeni keeps burning in several well-hidden incense

burners throughout the room. The drug is of drow manufac-

ture, and while it smells exotic and relaxing, it is hard to place.

A  character  who  smells  it  and  makes  a  DC  30  Knowledge

(nature) check recognizes the odor as diluted insanity mist

and knows of its effects. The smoke does not cause ability score

damage, but all those who breathe it take a 2 penalty on Will

saving throws.

Prices  for  food  and  drink  are  as  detailed  in  the  Players

Handbook, but anything served to the PCs is poisoned with

oil of taggit. Anyone who eats or drinks must make a DC 15

Fortitude save 1 minute later or fall unconscious. If all the

PCs fall unconscious, they are stripped of their gear, tied up,

and taken to the old storeroom. Akeni then leads them one at

a time upstairs to her chambers to fascinate them and implant

suggestions to remain here and join her cult. Characters who

prove too dif cult to manipulate are instead disposed of via

gas spore infestation.

If the PCs dont seem interested in ordering food or drink,

Akeni comes downstairs (disguised as an exotic human gypsy)

and tries to fascinate them with her bardic music so she can

suggest they eat and drink their  ll.

If  at  any  point  the  PCs  grow  belligerent,  attack,  or  start

casting spells (as a result of spotting the hidden crossbows, for

example), the cultists panic. They upend their tables to gain

cover and use the loaded crossbows attached to the undersides

of the tables to attack. Upending the tables and retrieving the

crossbows is a full-round action, but once done, the cultists

try to pin the PCs down with  re from their crossbows until

Akeni arrives with Glaken, her charmed troll minion, to help

 nish them off.

The cultists  ght to the death, completely loyal to Akeni.

Although all the cultists were commoners when Akeni  rst

recruited them, shes had them train as rogues quite rigorously,

and they have become fairly skilled thugs as a result. The DM

should feel free to add a few more dangerous cultists as desired.

Akeni herself does not stick around to the end of the  ght. If

things go poorly, she  ees the room, turns invisible, and tries

to escape on foot. If capture seems inevitable, she tries to bluff

the PCs into thinking that she, too, was charmed, and that the

actual leader of the cult is elsewhere. If the PCs penetrate her

gypsy disguise, she realizes that her unusual appearance (that

of a three-eyed drow) will probably cause her bluff to fail. In

this case, she tries to slip away or, if escape is impossible,  ghts

to the death.

Language: Common.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  A  cultist  deals  an  extra  3d6  points

of  damage  on  any  successful  attack  against   at-footed  or

 anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to

ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures

with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are

all immune to sneak attacks. A cultist can choose to deliver

nonlethal  damage  with  his  or  her  sneak  attack,  but  only

when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a

sap (blackjack).

Evasion (Ex): If a cultist is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him or her to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half

damage, the cultist takes no damage with a successful saving

throw.

Trap nding (Ex): A cultist can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He or she can use the Search skill

to  nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps

(DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If a cultists

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he

or she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A cultist retains his or her Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class even when  at-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (the cultist still loses his or her Dexterity bonus if

paralyzed or otherwise immobile).

Possessions:  masterwork  dagger,  +1  light  crossbow  with  10

crossbow  bolts,  ring  of  protection  +1, potion  of  cure  moderate

wounds, cult ring worth 100 gp, 15 gp in belt pouch.

2. STABLES

The  double  doors  at  the  east  end  of  the  stables  have  been

boarded  up  on  both  sides  to  prevent  entry  by  unwelcome

visitors (DC 23 Strength check to force open).

That this musty room was once a stable is obvious, but the place

does not smell of horses. Several pens line the walls to the east,

each with at least two crude cots.

Since Akeni took control, shes had her cultists temporarily

sleep in the stalls here while she prepares to have more suitable

chambers for the members constructed under the tavern.

3. OLD STOREROOM

This  room  seems  to  have  been  a  storeroom  for  the  stables.  A

number of sawhorses stand in the middle of the room, next to

several  coils  of  rope.  Barrels  of  grain  to  the  south  sit  astride  a

large mound of moldy hay bales.

The grain and hay are slowly rotting, having seen no use for the

several months since Akeni arrived. This room is now used to

hide prisoners the cultists capture. Akeni ties any captives to

the sawhorses while she  gures out what to do with them.

This room contains a single table surrounded by four chairs.

These  rooms  were  once  rented  out  to  special  guests  who

wanted to dine in privacy, but since Akeni arrived they have

seen little use.

5. KITCHEN

This large kitchen is dominated by a huge brick  replace. A long

table sits in the middle of the room, and cabinets line the walls.

For now, Akeni keeps the tavern functional to throw off inves-

tigations, so this kitchen is fairly clean and organized.

A DC 25 Search check uncovers a large glass jar hidden on

a shelf. Inside the jar are thirty doses of oil of taggit poison.

6. PANTRY (EL 3)

The double doors exiting the inn to the east have been boarded

up from the inside (DC 22 Strength check to force them open

from outside).

This room is used by Akenis assistant, a troll ranger she saved

from a group of adventurers months ago. Glaken is in love with

the beautiful drow but fears her temper and her third eye, so

he keeps his feelings hidden. Instead, he serves her loyally as

a thug and bodyguard, but cultists she favors and brings to

her room are marked by the troll as competition. Hed never

betray Akenis wishes and kill a cultist, but he does make his

anger toward them known with growls and threats, something

Akeni  nds quite endearing.

9. AKENIS ROOM (EL 13)

This large room is a well-appointed bedchamber. A roll-top desk

This small room is an earthen- oored pantry. Two double doors

to the east have been boarded up. The room itself is  lled with

crates  and  barrels.  A  strange  circular  shape  about  10  feet  in

diameter and covered with a heavy tarp  oats in the air near the

boarded-up doors.

This room is used to store food and water. Its also where Akeni

likes  to  get  rid  of  dead  bodies  that  could  otherwise  cause

uncomfortable inquiries if discovered.

The  heavy  tarp  covers  a  gas  spore.  The  plant  is  harmless

unless the tarp is removed, at which point it attacks anyone

nearby. Since Akeni has a beholder graft, the spore does not

attack her. When she wishes to dispose of a body, she merely

tosses the victim (alive or dead) into this room and pulls aside

the tarp. She then waits for the body to be turned into young

gas spores, leads the fungus outside at night when no one is

on the road, and kills them with ranged weapons once shes

outside the burst radius of their death throes.

When it comes time to move on, she harvests several doses

of  gas  spore  powder,  kills  the  remaining  spore  from  a  safe

distance, and then uses the powder to grow a new spore from

an unlucky donor once she settles into her new home.

Gas Spore (1): hp 15; see page 148.

7. RECORDS ROOM

This room contains a single desk and several large cabinets and

shelves.

When the Lost Gull was operational, its owners used this room

to track expenses and sort money. The room has been unused

for some time now, since Akeni keeps any pro ts from the

tavern for herself.

8. GLAKENS ROOM (EL 11)

This  was  once  a  bedroom,  but  most  of  the  furniture  has  been

smashed to splinters. The ruins have been used to make a crude

nest to the west, and the entire place reeks of  lth.

Once the personal quarters of the Lost Gulls owner, Akeni

has chosen this room as her own. When not out seeking new

cultists to recruit, she spends much of her time here, dally-

ing with particularly handsome cultists. She is likely to be

encountered here if the PCs manage to in ltrate the tavern

without raising an alarm or being welcomed by the other

cultists. If caught off guard in her natural form (instead of in

her gypsy disguise), she tries to bluff the PCs into believing

that shes been captured and cursed by a terrible beholder that

lurks below in the pantry off the kitchen. If the PCs could just

slay the beast (which, she tells them, covers itself with a tarp

when it sleeps), shell gladly reward them with whatever they

wish. Of course, this is a ruse to get the PCs to attack the gas

spore in area 6 while she sneaks away to regroup and send her

cultists and Glaken after them.

allies against fear and improve their combat abilities.

Suggestion (Sp): Use music or poetics to make a suggestion

(as the spell) to a creature that she has already fascinated.

Elf Traits: Elves have immunity to magic sleep effects. An elf

who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door

is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively

looking for it.

Implanted  Eyeball  (Su):  Akenis  implanted  eyeball  grants

her knowledge of the beholder language and a +4 bonus on

Spot checks. It also grants her the use of a number of eye ray

powers, similar to those  red by a beholders eyestalks. She

can use each eye ray up to twice per day as a standard action

that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The implanted

eyeball closes and must rest for the entire round immediately

following a round in which a ray attack is used.

Each eye effect resembles a spell cast by a 4th-level sorcerer

but follows the rules for a ray. Each ray has a range of 100 feet

and a save DC of 19. As a 4th level ocular adept, she has access

to the following eye rays: charm person, in ict moderate wounds,

sleep, and slow.

Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light (such

as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds drow for 1 round. On

subsequent rounds, Akeni is dazzled as long as she remains

in the affected area.

ew monsters inspire as much horror or terror as the

illithids.  They  are  rightly  feared  by  everyone  and

everything.  Few  can  match  them  in  undiluted  evil,

cruelty, or cunning. Their origins are cloaked in mystery,

their  plans  are  enigmatic,  and  their  culture  and  thought

processes are utterly alien.

Illithids are better known by their common name of mind

 ayers, and it is an apt title. A mind  ayers attack strikes into

a victims most vulnerable spot. It can psychically peel back

a targets personality the way a surgeon draws back swollen

 esh. Tentacles slick with slime writhe across ravaged edges

of bone to caress gray, glittering coils of brain before drawing

them from the conscious, screaming prey.

Where the illithids came from, why they choose to live in

eternal darkness beneath the earth, what they seek, why they

take  such  delight  in  cruelty  and  horrorthese  questions

have stymied sages for centuries. The answers are startling

and horrible, yet provide little illumination. One can know

the mind  ayers without understanding them.

Illithids  are  humanoid  monsters,  roughly  the  size  of

humans. Their pale mauve  esh is covered in glistening

slime, and in place of a human head they have a terrifying

visage reminiscent of nothing so much as a four-limbed

octopus.  Their  evil  reputation  is  based  on  their  horrid

appetite for living brains. All mature illithids are psioni-

cally gifted, and some are wizards or (rarely) sorcerers

as well.

Mind  ayers dwell underground and prefer to remain

there. They have sometimes been encountered in deep-

sided  chasms  and  half-buried  surface  ruins,  but  the

world beneath the surface is their realm. In that place,

 lled with fearsome races and monsters, mind  ayers

are among the most dangerous predators of the dark.

A lone illithid hunting in its element is more than a

match for a group of surface warriors, and seldom is an

illithid alone. They travel with the protection of their

minions, enslaved subterranean monsters, or worse

yet, others of their own kind. Those who explore the

deep underground paths agree that it is better to die

almost any other death than to fall into the clutches

of the mind  ayers.

An illithids head is a monstrous sight, resembling a four-

tentacled octopus sitting atop the creatures shoulders. The two

eyes, uniformly pale white and without pupils, are sheltered

beneath  prominent  brow  ridges.  The  creatures  soft,  moist

skin is mauve in color and glistens beneath a thin coating of

mucus.

Mind  ayers have three long, slender  ngers and an oppos-

able thumb on each hand, and two webbed toes on each foot.

Each   nger  and  toe  is  capped  with  a  wicked-looking  nail,

which arent as dangerous as they seem. In fact, the nails are

composed of soft cartilage and present little danger to anyone

struck or scratched by them.

INTERNAL ANATOMY

Internally,  illithids  are  similar  to  humans.  More  precisely,

they are very close to the base stock of the host in which they

grow bodies prior to ceremorphosis (see Reproduction, below).

They have hearts, lungs, livers, spleens, stomachs, and digestive

systems that are recognizable to any anatomist. The process of

ceremorphosis alters the appearance of these organs but not

their function or the need to have them.

What  it  does  alter,  however,  is  the  host  bodys  nervous

system.  An  illithids  nervous  system  is  more  extensive  and

more advanced than any humans. Every part of an illithids

body is wired into the brain with direct connections unseen

in any other creature. In effect, an illithids entire body is an

extended brain. One might question the cognitive power of a

liver, but there is no doubting that an illithid has tremendous

physical awareness of its own body and physical condition.

For reasons explained below, an illithids brain is anathema

to its body. The process of ceremorphosis creates something

closer to parasite than brain. That parasite becomes an indis-

pensable part of the body. Its great weakness is that it does not

produce the critical enzymes, hormones, or psychic energy

that the body needs to survive and function. Those critical

components must come from consumed brains.

Because of the mind  ayers all-embracing nervous system,

food does not pass through a simple gastrointestinal tract but

through a cognitive, self-aware digestive system. That system

absorbs more than just nourishment from food. It scavenges

enzymes,  hormones,  and  most  important,  psychic  energy.

Illithids are known for consuming brains, but they eat other

food as well, most of which contains various amounts of these

needed  enzymes  and  hormones.  Internal  organs  are  good

sources,  and  they  rank  high  on  illithid  menus.  Brains  are

ripe with all three and are the only external source of psychic

energy.

MOUTH AND TENTACLES

An illithids tentacles can vary from 2 to 4 feet in length when

fully extended. When the creature is at rest and not excited, the

tentacles appear shorter. Even then, they are in almost constant

motion, writhing absent-mindedly as the creature ponders.

These limbs are extraordinarily dexterous and serve the mind

 ayer as an additional set of hands, even to the point of being

used to punctuate or accentuate communication. The tentacles

are also quite strong; an illithid receives the bene t of its full

Strength score in any situation involving its tentacles.

The  tentacle  cluster  surrounds  a  circular,  jawless  mouth

ringed  with  rows  of  small,  rasping  teeth.  The  teeth  serve

primarily as tools for gripping and to prevent slippery gobs of

brain matter from falling out of the mouth. An illithid does not

bite through the skin and skull of a victim, instead dissolving

it with a powerful enzyme transmitted through ducts in the

tentacles. This enzyme acts so quickly that the tentacles appear

to push right through the scalp and bone as if through soft

clay. The enzyme is highly unstable and never survives more

than brief contact with the air, making it impossible to harvest

from slain illithids. No material other than illithid mucus is

known to resist its corrosive effect.

ILLITHID SENSES

Although their white, pupilless eyes suggest blindness, mind

 ayers see quite well. Their acuity lies entirely in the realm

of darkvision, which operates out to 60 feet. Their hearing is

a little less acute than a humans. They have relatively good

auditory direction sense (they can tell where a sound is coming

from), but they have poor discernment (ability to separate and

recognize discrete components of a particular sound).

REPRODUCTION

From birth to death, the physiology of the illithid life cycle is

unique, and unspeakably horrible.

In  basic  con guration,  a  mind   ayer  is  amphibious.  The

 rst portion of its life is spent as a tadpole hatched from an

egg. An adult illithid spawns hermaphroditically two or three

times during its lifetime, depositing about a thousand eggs in

a briny pool constructed for just this purpose. The eggs hatch

after about a month, releasing the writhing tadpoles into the

pool.

The tadpoles spend ten years in the pool, where they are fed

a fatty mash of brain material and other organs prepared by

nursery attendants. After a decade, they have grown from a

fraction of an inch to around 3 inches in length. At this point,

in terms of sentience and intellect, they are still little more

than intelligent frogs.

The nurseries are home to more than just tadpoles. At the

bottom of the pool resides an elder brain, which survives by

preying on the defenseless tadpoles. The tiny percentage of

tadpoles that survive a decade in the poolno more than a

few in a thousandare rightly considered by the illithids to

be the  ttest, canniest specimens. By surviving, they earn the

privilege of undergoing ceremorphosis.

This is the real mystery of the illithid life cycle, for illithids

do not grow their own bodies. Instead, a mature tadpole is

inserted into the ear, nostril, or eye of a helpless humanoid

captive.  Over  a  period  of  several  days,  the  tadpole  burrows

into the host brain, consuming gray matter and gaining body

62

mass in a nearly equal ratio. When the process is complete, the

victims brain is completely replaced by the tadpoles bloated

tissue. The tadpole is neurologically melded onto what remains

of the lower brain stem and assumes complete control of the

bodys nervous system. The victim dies irrevocably, but the

body lives on with a parasite serving as its brain.

Victims have been rescued from this horrid fate, but only

if help arrives quickly. A victim is permanently drained of 1

point of Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Dexterity every

hour after tadpole insertion. When any one ability is reduced

to 0, the victims psychic essence is destroyed and replaced by

the tadpoles awakening mind. Before that point is reached,

restoration can reinstate lost ability points but wont kill the

tadpole, so damage keeps accruing. The only sure way to save

the victim is to kill the tadpole. The tadpole itself is very easy

to kill (automatic kill with a coup de grace), but its location

inside the victims head is a serious complicating factor. Spells

such as cure disease and remove curse have no effect; only a heal

spell can save a victim undergoing ceremorphosis.

In  most  cases,  the  only  way  to  guarantee  the  tadpole  is

slain is to crush or incinerate the victims head. At that point,

resurrection, true resurrection, or raise dead come into play. Raise

dead alone is of no avail if the victims head was destroyed in

the process of killing the tadpole.

The process of ceremorphosis takes a week to complete but

it  cannot  be  reversed  after

any of the victims ability

scores  are  reduced  to  0.

From  that  point,  no

means can bring the

victim back short of

a miracle.

Only certain races are used by the mind  ayers as recipients

of ceremorphosis. In general, donors must be humanoid, mam-

malian, between 5 feet 4 inches and 6 feet 2 inches tall, and

weigh from 130 to 270 pounds. Humans, elves, drow, githzerai,

githyanki,  grimlocks,  gnolls,  goblinoids  (of  Medium  size),

and orcs are sought-after donors. Races smaller or larger than

these, whether in height, weight, or size category, are never

used, and neither are reptilian or amphibian races. Hal ings,

dwarves, derro, duergar, gnomes, centaurs and their relatives,

giants, and kuo-toas might be used as thralls or as food, but

they are never used as ceremorphosis subjects.

DEVELOPMENT AND AGING

At the end of the week of ceremorphosis, nothing remains of

the victim. Its tissues have been entirely replaced with the

rapidly transforming mind  ayer tissue. The creature is warm-

blooded and hermaphroditic, with a life expectancy of up to

135 years. It looks fully grown, but the newly ceremorphosed

creature is an infant, only days into its sentient existence. It

must grow in learning and experience before coming into its

full power. This process varies from one mind  ayer to another

but the average growing up period lasts about twenty years.

Immature illithids are seldom allowed outside the security of

a well-protected subterranean city.

THE ILLITHID MIND

Illithids seem at most times to be calm, collected, and dispas-

sionate.  Occasionally

they  appear  to  be

gripped  by  great

anger,  but  its

other creatures to distinguish whether that is a true emotion or

a display to impress outsiders or enemies. Because of this, mind

 ayers are assumed to have either few emotions or tremendous

self-control. Both assumptions are wrong.

Illithids feel intense emotions but internalize them almost

completely.  A  mind   ayer  that  looks  calm  might  be  raging

with a cauldron of emotion beneath the surface. In addition,

an illithids emotions are entirely negative: Anger, fear, envy,

hate, shame, indignation, contempt, pride, and anxiety com-

prise nearly their entire emotional repertoire. The closest they

come to experiencing joy is the feeling they get when eating

a brain, but even this is mixed with such sadistic and hateful

overtones that it cant be considered happiness as most races

would de ne it.

This constant negative emotional state colors an illithids

every thought and perception. Because it knows no happiness,

it spends no time planning how to become happy. Pride, sati-

ated curiosity, and self-satisfaction are a mind  ayers highest

emotional states. These feelings motivate it to action.

ILLITHID VARIANTS

Illithids are not a homogenous race. Their decade-long incuba-

tion as tadpoles and the mysterious process of ceremorphosis

spawn numerous mutations and variations. Most of these do

not survive.

Ulitharids

An ulitharid is immediately distinguishable from an illithid

by two characteristics: it towers over its cousins, standing 7 to

8 feet tall, and it has six tentacles rather than four.

The birth of an ulitharid is a signi cant event in an illithid

colony. They are suf ciently rare that a colony with a single

ulitharid considers itself lucky.

As a tadpole, an ulitharid is indistinguishable from other

tadpoles. However, it spends twice as long as a tadpoletwenty

years, compared to the standard tenbefore reaching maturity.

Its true nature does not become evident even to other mind

 ayers  until  ceremorphosis.  Once  an  ulitharid  begins  its

transformation, it is greeted as something akin to a prophet.

These creatures rise to positions of civil or military leader-

ship within their communities, and they frequently receive

diplomatic  embassies  from  other  colonies  that  are  not  so

blessed. In addition to their greater stature and revered status,

ulitharids live twice as long as other mind  ayers, compensat-

ing somewhat for their rarity of birth.

For ulitharid statistics, see Chapter 8.

Illithid Sorcerers

Considering their powerful intellects, its not surprising that

many  illithids  study  wizardry.  What  is  surprising  is  that  a

small number of illithids are actually sorcerers. How sorcerous

talent manifests itself in creatures as nonhuman and alien as

mind  ayers is a great mystery to those who study the basis of

sorcery. Certainly, mind  ayers have no dragon blood. It could

be that this tendency depends on the history of the donor body

prior to it undergoing ceremorphosis, but since no systematic

study is possible, no one knows.

However  its  explained,  the  combination  of  psionic  and

sorcerous  power  is  fearsome.  These  creatures  are  shunned

even by others of their own kind.

Elder Brains

At the center of every large mind  ayer community is a fetid

pool of murky, swirling, briny  uid. The pool itself can have

any con guration, but in every case it serves two purposes.

First, it is an incubator for illithid tadpoles; hundreds of thou-

sands might inhabit the pool as a teeming mass at any given

time. Second, it serves as the nutrient pool for the communitys

elder brain, the intelligence that guides and unites the illithids

into their tightly woven society.

How an elder brain comes to be is unknown. Even to the mind

 ayers, an elder brain is timeless and ageless. It is an amorphous,

writhing bulk of tissue, the conglomeration of cast-off brain

matter from deceased mind  ayers. When a mind  ayer dies, its

brain is removed ceremonially and cast into the pool, whereupon

it sinks to the bottom to be absorbed into the greater mass. This

melding of an individuals brain into the communal elder brain

is a fate to which mind  ayers aspire; they do not fear or regret

their passing. If anything, they fear a death that prevents them

from becoming a part of the elder brain.

No individual personalities survive absorption by the elder

brain. It is sentient (some might say super-sentient), but its

consciousness lies outside any human or mind  ayer experi-

ence. The nature of its intellect is a mystery to mind  ayers,

because even their potent psionics cannot penetrate beyond

the  shallowest  layers  of  an  elder  brain  to  discern  its  inner

workings.

The brain is clearly a physical as well as a psychic entity. It

subsists by extracting presentient psychic vibrations from the

tadpoles that teem around it. Devoured tadpoles are reduced

to oily residue that dissolves slowly into the brine.

An elder brain is typically 8 to 10 feet in diameter, regardless

of how many brains are absorbed into its mass. While an elder

brains mass doesnt increase beyond a known maximum, its

intelligence and knowledge do. Each new brain contributes

all of its life experience to the elder brains totality.

Elder  brains  rule  their  communities  completely.  Their

dictates and pronouncements are beyond question. Some are

cruelly  dictatorial,  while  others  allow  varying  amounts  of

pqqqqqqqqqrs

PSIONIC SUBSTITUTION

In Chapter 8, the elder brain is described as a 20th-level sor-

cerer.  This  spellcasting  merely  serves  to  emulate  its  psionic

abilities for DMs who choose not to use psionics in their game.

Elder brains are never true sorcerers.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

freedom. The most passive serve only as advisors and sources

of  historical  information.  The  norm  is  a  degree  of  control

somewhere between absolute authoritarianism and enlight-

ened despotism.

An elder brains telepathic range extends 350 feet, although

some elder brains might have feats, spells, or psionic powers

that extend this range. Within that radius, an elder brain is

aware of all living things. Intervening material has no effect

on its ability to communicate or on its awareness of all thought

within range. This hyper-awareness makes it almost impossible

for enemies to sneak into an illithid community. Their pres-

ence is detected and resistance organized long before intruders

move close enough to present a signi cant threat.

Besides  communicating  directly  with  individual  mind

 ayers, an elder brain can establish contact between two or

more illithids that would otherwise be outside one anothers

range of 100 feet. In this capacity, the elder brain acts only as

a  conduit,  albeit  one  that  hears  and  remembers  everything

that passes through it. Some elder brains use spells such as

Rarys telepathic bond or equivalent psionic powers to keep in

touch with individual mind  ayers at tremendous distances,

allowing near-instantaneous communication throughout the

community.

Because of an elder brains awareness, mind  ayers are of

necessity among the most lawful of creatures. Plotting against

the community or the elder brain is impossible. Even deviating

from the social norm is likely to bring about swift corrective

action  ranging  from  a  single  stern  warning  to  coercion  or

psychic annihilation, depending on how harsh that particular

elder brain cares to be at the moment.

Elder brains grow and gain power continually. They never

become old, in rm, or senile (their sanity might be called into

question, but only from the limited perspective of mortal crea-

tures). A large number of illithids believe that all elder brains

are growing toward an ultimate purposethat at some point

in the future, the brains will meld into a single, all-seeing elder

brain  capable  of  communicating  across  limitless  distances

through the Astral Plane.

Mind   ayers  are  subject  to  one  huge  misconception

concerning elder brains. They believe that their individual con-

sciousness survives after joining the elder brain. This notion

is completely wrong. The elder brain extracts knowledge and

strength from the brain matter and adds its mass to its own,

but the illithid is dead. Only the elder brain lives forever. Elder

brains guard this secret, as one might expect.

For elder brain statistics, see page 144.

Brain Golems

One of the most astounding and disturbing abilities of an elder

brain is its capacity to create what is known as a brain golem.

This construct is formed from the brains of intelligent crea-

tures, with a body that is an extruded portion of an elder brains

own mass. The head of the golem secretes a slimy substance

that sheathes the body in thin, membranous skin.

Few nonillithids have ever seen one of these monstrosities.

They  sometimes  function  as  added  muscle  for  an  illithid

community  that  is  faced  with  imminent  danger,  but  their

main function is to serve as an elder brains physical hands and

carry out tasks that are too important, secret, or complex for

mind  ayers themselves. As such, they are viewed with great

wonder by mind  ayers. The emergence of a brain golem from

an elder brains pool is considered a grand portent and treated

with awed solemnity by the community.

A brain golem shares its creators imperviousness to psychic

probes.  It  never  communicates  in  any  way  with  entities  it

encounters. If it is destroyed before returning to the pool for

reabsorption, its mass doesnt seem to be missed by the elder

brain.

Brain golems are described in the Fiend Folio.

illithid wears nothing to cover its dark gray  esh. Its head is

smaller and of a different,  attened shape, appearing almost

to  have  shrunk  or  partially  collapsed  inward.  A  vampire

illithids tentacles are longer and more muscular than those

of a living mind  ayer, and it uses them for bludgeoning as

much as grasping.

Such  a  monster  would  be  truly  terrifying  if  it  possessed

the mighty intellect of a mind  ayer. Fortunately, vampiric

mind   ayers  are  completely  feral.  Their  minds  hold  bestial

cunning and savagery, but they do not think or reason. Some

portion of their minds must recall their former lives, since

their favorite haunts are subterranean, in the types of areas

where  mind   ayers  live.  Other  mind   ayers  are  a  vampiric

illithids worst enemies, because they destroy one whenever

given a chance.

Alhoon

A  lot  of  mind   ayers  practice  magic,  and  some  grow  quite

powerful.  However,  illithid  society  prefers  to  focus  on  the

creatures true heritage of psionic mastery. As a result, excessive

study of magic is considered a distraction at best and an offense

at worst. Mind  ayers that persistently violate this stricture

suffer the ultimate punishment; they are banned from joining

with the elder brain upon their deaths.

For that reason, mind  ayers that study magic, and especially

sorcery, devote the better part of their attention to devising

ways to extend their lives unnaturally. The ultimate goal is

to become a lich. Those that succeed at becoming liches are

known as alhoons to other mind  ayers, or illithiliches in the

Common tongue.

Physically, an alhoon can be dif cult to distinguish from a

normal mind  ayer. The most obvious difference is the lack

of the mind  ayers ever-present mucus coating. Without that

protection, an alhoons skin becomes dry and cracked. Its eyes

might appear shriveled and sunken. Both of these clues are easily

missed by someone who hasnt seen a living mind  ayer.

Because of its fascination with arcane magic, a typical alhoon

possesses no more psionic power than an average mind  ayer.

Its frightful mastery of magic more than makes up for its lack

of psionic prowess.

Mind  ayers universally shun alhoons, considering them

abominable  because  the  undead  creatures  have  sacri ced

any hope of joining with the elder brain. An alhoon residing

near  an  illithid  community  or  outpost  will  be  hunted  and

exterminated if its presence is discovered.

For alhoon statistics, see Chapter 8.

Urophions

The  racial  limitations  involved  in  selecting  donor  bodies

for ceremorphosis are well known to the illithids. Still, this

knowledge does not prevent them from experimenting with

other creatures to see what might result. In most cases, both

host and tadpole die.

Oddly, implanting a tadpole into a roper proves viable. The

result is a urophion, or illithid roper. This is the only known

case  of  tadpole  implantation  succeeding  in  a  cold-blooded

creature.

Physically, ropers and urophions are nearly indistinguish-

able.  Urophions  are  stationed  around  illithid  communities

to act as guardians and sentinels. The live their lives much

as any roper would: solitary, sedentary, and stationary. Their

acute senses allow them to detect intruders at great distances.

When a victim approaches within 50 feet, a urophion unleashes

a powerful mental blast to stun the prey, then uses its six very

long tentacles (up to 50 feet in length) to grasp the victim, drag

it close, and extract its brain.

Intellectually, urophions are on par with any other illithid,

and their psionic abilities are nearly as powerful. Nevertheless,

they are viewed by the community as a whole as inferior and

suited only for lives of dreary service. Their one honor is to

be offered to the elder brain upon their deaths.

Brilliant  but  isolated,  urophions  live  lives  of  desperate

loneliness and frustration. While most remain loyal to their

creators, some wander away in pursuit of their own inscrutable

objectives.

For urophion statistics, see Chapter 8.

Mind Flayer Vampires

Neothelids

Even stranger than illithid sorcerers are illithid vampires. How

they come to be is unknown. Unlike other vampires, they do

not create spawn or propagate their kind by leaving victims

wounded but not yet undead.

A vampiric mind  ayer bears little resemblance to its kin.

Where mind  ayers favor rich, luxurious robes, a vampiric

Among the strongest taboos in illithid society is the idea of

not implanting a mature tadpole into a donor brain. While

some tadpoles are implanted experimentally, with death the

almost  certain  outcome,  none  are  intentionally  kept  back

from implantation.

66

On rare occasions, an illithid community collapses, typically

from an external assault, and the elder brain is killed. When

that happens, the tadpoles are suddenly freed from predation

by the always-hungry elder brain. They, in turn, are no longer

fed  by  their  caretakers,  and  the  tadpoles  grow  increasingly

hungry. Driven by hunger, they turn to cannibalism. Only

one tadpole survives from the thousands in the pool.

The psychic energy that this one survivor absorbs from

its  fellow  tadpoles  (and  possibly

from  the  decaying  corpse  of

the  elder  brain,  as  well)  allows

it to grow much larger than any

normal  tadpole  wouldto  the

size  of  a  small  dog.  Eventually,

hunger again drives it to a desper-

ate act: crawling out of the briny

pool into the greater subterranean

world in search of food. Once free

of the pool, the creature lives

by preying on rats and other

vermin, a diet that allows it

to grow even larger.

Eventually,  such  an

abomination  catches  and

devours a sentient creature,

whether  a  duergar,  a  drow,  or  a

luckless  human  far  from  home.

Consuming  that   rst  thinking

brain  triggers  the  same  reaction

in  the  tadpole  that  would  have

occurred if the tadpole had been

implanted  normally.  It  becomes

self-aware,  and  its  latent  psionic

potential awakens.

At  that  point,  the  creature

becomes a neothelid. Untrained,

savage, feral, and brilliant, it knows

nothing beyond the squalid, preda-

tory existence it has lived so far.

Neothelids  prowl  subterranean

passages in search of more brains

to  sate  their  constant  hunger,

growing  ever  larger  and  more

vicious.  Truly  leviathan  speci-

mens have been spotted prowling

the deepest underground.

In addition to having the usual psionic abilities of an illithid,

these  creatures  can  spray  tissue-dissolving  enzymes  from

their  tentacle  ducts,  reducing  victims  to  a  puddle  of  slime

and leaving only the pulsing brain unharmed. They have no

knowledge of their links to illithids, so theyre just as likely

to prey on mind  ayers as on anything else.

Neothelids  are  described  in  the  Expanded  Psionics

Handbook.

ILLITHID MAGIC

Although their highly structured society is sometimes hide-

bound and conservative, illithids are tremendously creative

problem  solvers.  Whether  working  with  pulleys  and  gears,

psionics, magic, alchemy, or a combination of all four, their

great intelligence and natural competitiveness lead to unique

solutions.

MIND FLAYERS

AND MAGIC ITEMS

Unlike  many  other  aberrations,

whose  physical  shape  makes  the

use  of  humanoid-crafted  magic

items  dif cult,  mind   ayers  are

humanoid  enough  in  form  to

wear the same magic items

that  any  human  character

could wear.

Mind   ayers  naturally

favor items that add to their

already  formidable  mental

acuity, seeking out (or craft-

ing on their own) headbands

of  intellect  or  cloaks  of  cha-

risma.  They  also  greatly  value

defensive  magic,  such  as  rings  of

protection,  cloaks  of  resistance,  and

bracers of armor. Mind  ayers feel

that  they  are  far  too  important

to  allow  themselves  to  be  killed

through insuf cient preparation,

and go to great lengths to provide

themselves with magical defenses

of all sorts.

Illithids  that  gain  levels  as

wizards or clerics acquire item cre-

ation feats and produce a variety of

useful  itemsparticularly  items

that  provide  physical  protection

from harm. In addition to bracers,

rings,  and  similar  devices,  mind

 ayers also produce a number of

unique items, which are described

below.

A brain canister

Brain Canister: The ultimate

goal of every mind  ayer is to join the elder brain upon death.

To be denied this is the worst fate imaginable. When illithids

die  far  from  home,  their  brains  cannot  be  brought  back  to

the elder brain before putrefaction begins. Once a deceased

illithids brain begins to rot, the elder brain does not accept

it. This is viewed as a great waste.

To  prevent  such  a  tragedy,  mind   ayers  developed  the

brain canister. This metal urn is typically made from copper

and  lled with an alchemical solution. A brain placed in the

canister lives on inde nitely, although it is unconscious and

insensible.

Removing a brain for storage in the canister requires a DC

25 Heal check (mind  ayers gain a +5 circumstance bonus on

this check due to their natural facility at the task). The body

must be living when removal begins, and the brain must be

placed in the canister within 1 minute of removal, or it dies.

The creature whose brain is removed dies immediately and

cannot be raised or resurrected unless the brain is recovered

or destroyed.

Mind  ayers sometimes use brain canisters to store meals for

long journeys, when it might not be possible to feed as often

as they like. They also store the brains of particularly interest-

ing humanoids, so they can perform terrible experiments or

transplants on the brain or question these individuals through

various psionic means.

repose; Price 30,000 gp; Weight 5 lb.

Brainmate: Mind  ayers in the vicinity of an elder brain

feel its presence constantly. This is not an unpleasant sensation

for them. The never-ending hum of the elder brains activity is a

reassuring sensation for an illithid. When a mind  ayer travels

outside the elder brains range of in uence, that comforting

presence is lost. An imperfect solution to this problem is the

brainmate.

The  brainmate  consists  of  a  tiny  bud,  about  the  size  of  a

walnut,  taken  from  an  elder  brain  and  encased  in  a  crystal

globe  lled with mucus. The brain matter itself might or might

not be visible within the murky goo. The globe can be worn

on a chain around the neck or simply carried on the wearers

person.

A  brainmate  is  nominally  sentient.  It  contains  a  tiny

portion  of  the  elder  brains  knowledge,  and  it  responds  to

direct telepathic questions. Although a brainmate does not

provide the comforting background hum of mental activity

that illithids  nd so soothing, it is a useful companion to a

far-ranging mind  ayer.

If the wearer has the telepathy special ability, the ability

to  cast  Rarys  telepathic  bond,  or  the  mindlink  psionic  power,

he can access the brainmate to make use of its knowledge. A

brainmate possesses 10 ranks in two speci c Knowledge skills,

allowing the wearer to make checks in those speci c skills as

if he possessed the same number of ranks. The wearer uses his

own Intelligence modi er on these checks

Besides storing information from the elder brain, a brain-

mate also records everything its owner imparts to it. If the

brainmate is worn or carried by a telepathic user, it records

everything  the  individual  sees,  hears,  or  experiences.  It  is

common,  therefore,  for  illithid  spies  to  be  equipped  with

brainmates. When a spy returns to its community, the elder

brain has perfect access to everything the spy encountered,

with no memory loss or room for misinterpretation.

telepathic bond or telepathy as a special ability; Price 10,000 gp.

Dampsuit: A dampsuit is a close- tting bodysuit of slick

leather that covers a mind  ayer from head to toe. It seals in a

creatures precious body moisture when the illithid ventures

away from the dark, clammy warrens where it normally lives.

The suit itself consists of several complex layers, each moist-

ened and lubricated with mucus for easy movement. The suit

traps  all  moisture  that  escapes  from  the  wearers  body  and

recirculates it.

Wearing a dampsuit, a mind  ayer can operate in dry, hot

conditions that would quickly exhaust or kill an unprotected

illithid.  Under  normal  conditions,  a  mind   ayers  tentacles

remain curled up inside a special pouch designed for just that

purpose on the front of the suit. When needed, they can be

thrust out through a valve in the face mask, then withdrawn

(along with a brain) when their work is done.

A dampsuit is a suit of +1 slick leather armor that protects its

wearer with an endure elements effect.

Faint  abjuration;  CL  4th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

Striator: This uniquely illithid stylus looks like nothing

more than a nicely polished piece of wood or bone. It typically

is about a foot long, an inch wide, and a quarter to a half-inch

thick. More ornate versions have pleasantly sweeping curves

that  t the hand or are decorated with intricate inked carvings.

The  only  universal  distinguishing  characteristics  are  four

small,  attened nibs at one end.

When a creature grasps the stylus and draws it across a piece

of parchment or paper, the striator reads the thoughts of the

writer and causes a pattern of dashes and spaces to be raised up

on the surface in four parallel lines. This is Qualith, a system

of tactile writing used by illithids (see Language, below).

The striator draws its information directly from the users

thoughts and transcribes the data into Qualith whether the

writer understands Qualith or not.

Faint  divination;  CL  3rd;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  detect

thoughts; Price 1,500 gp.

Thought Extruder: On occasion, a brain is more valuable to

mind  ayers if its not eaten. Prisoners, for example, might have

important knowledge that the mind  ayers need but cannot

extract by brute force. No matter how powerful a characters

psionic or magic resistance to mind-reading might be, it can

be overcome through the use of a thought extruder. The device

allows no saving throw and does not permit spell resistance.

This diabolical device is a collapsible cage of wires, mesh,

and needles. Once its  tted around the head of a restrained

subject (which takes 20 minutes), a mind  ayer uses its bio-

corrosive enzyme to open a  st-sized hole in the prisoners

skull,  exposing  the  brain.  Needles  then  drill  into  the  gray

matter, probing for active thought centers, pleasure and pain

receptors, and repressed or shielded memories. The operator

must be able to establish telepathic communication with the

subject by means of the telepathy special ability or a spell or

The needles are thought conductors made from an organic

material  specially  developed  by  illithid  alchemists.  They

enable the operator to read whatever is in the subjects mind.

The process is slow; the operator can ask only one question

per minute, but receives a complete, truthful answer.

With each question, the victim makes a DC 20 Fortitude

save. Each failure permanently drains its Intelligence, Wisdom,

and Charisma scores by 1. When the illithids are done asking

questions,  the  victim  makes  a  Will  save  using  its  current

Wisdom modi er. Failure leaves it permanently insane, as the

spell insanity.

NAUTILOID

It is rumored that not all mind  ayers live beneath the surface.

Some tales speak of ships shaped like the shell of a nautilus that

are capable of  ying through the spaces between worlds. Most

serious scholars discount these tales as pure fantasy, despite

those who claim to have seen such ships  rst-hand.

The illithids themselves know that the tales are true. The

great ships are remnants of their glorious future, when their

empire will span not just worlds but the entire universe (see

The Whispering Shadow, below). The knowledge of how to

build these stunning vessels is lostor, more correctly, hasnt

been discovered yet. Until it is, the remaining ships ply the

great gulfs of the night skies cautiously, seeking evidence of

lost mind- ayer colonies and hidden githyanki outposts.

PSIONIC SEAL

Some mind  ayers know how to create a special type of magic

item known as a psionic seal. These are similar to psionic tat-

toos (see the Expanded Psionics Handbook), although the design

is created purely by psionic power; no ink is involved.

Creating a psionic seal requires the Craft Psionic Seal feat.

(If you are using the Expanded Psionics Handbook, you might

decide that mind  ayers that have the Scribe Tattoo feat can

choose to make both psionic tattoos and psionic seals.)

Psionic  seals  can  be  inscribed  on   esh  or  on  just  about

anything  else,  including  doors,  hallways,  chests,  articles  of

clothing, weapons, or pages of a book. Creatures can wear no

more than one psionic seal at a time; additional seals scribed

onto them simply fail.

The caster level or manifester level of a psionic seal is the

minimum  level  required  to  cast  or  manifest  the  power.  A

psionic seal can hold spells or powers of 3rd level or lower.

When worn on a creature, a psionic seal activates when its

wearer touches it and wills it to activate. This is a standard

action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The wearer doesnt

get to make any decisions about the seals effectthe person

who scribed the seal has already done so.

When  scribed  on  an  object,  a  psionic  seal  can  be  set  to

activate in response to one of three events: when touched and

willed to activate (useful for helpful spells or powers), when

touched at all (useful for traps), or when a creature with speci c

observable characteristics moves within 5 feet of the psionic

seal (useful for trapping doorways, for example). In the latter

case, the seal must be in plain viewit cant be hidden inside

an object, for example.

A harmful psionic seal is considered a magic trap. It is rarely

hard to  nd, since it must be in plain view to function, but

disarming the trap requires a Disable Device check (DC 25 +

spell level of the spell or power used to make the seal).

In any case, a psionic seal fades away after it is triggered

once.

Craft Psionic Seal

A creature with this feat can create psionic glyphs or symbols

that hold spells or psionic powers until triggered.

Prerequisites:  Int  15,  psionic  ability  (spell-like  abilities

described  as  psionics,  psi-like  abilities,  or  psionic  powers),

caster level or manifester level 7th.

Bene  t: A creature can cast or manifest any arcane spell or

psionic power it has access to as a psionic seal. If it is creating a

psionic seal of an arcane spell, it must have prepared the spell

to be scribed and must provide any material components or

focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell or manifesting

the power would reduce the creatures XP total, it pays that

cost upon beginning the seal in addition to the XP cost for

making  the  seal  itself.  Likewise,  material  components  are

consumed  when  the  creature  begins  scribing  the  seal,  but

focuses are not.

A single object of Medium size or smaller can hold only one

psionic seal. A larger object can hold one seal per 100 square

feet of surface area. A creature can also scribe a psionic seal

on a willing creature, but a creature can hold only one psionic

seal at a time; any additional seals inscribed on that creature

automatically fail.

A psionic seal has a price equal to its spell or power level

 caster or manifester level  50 gp. (A 0-level spell or power

counts as 1/2 level.) The creature crafting the seal must spend

1/25 of the price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-

half the price to inscribe the seal.

RESONANCE STONE

Resonance stones play an important role in mind  ayer society.

Very few mind  ayers do not own at least one, and many of

them own several.

The best description of a resonance stone would be emo-

tion  transmitter.  Each  stone  stores  a  speci c  emotion  and

broadcasts that emotion over a small area. The typical range

is 30 feet; more powerful stones can have larger areas of effect,

while very small stones might be so weak that they must be in

contact with the skin to be perceived.

There  is  no  universal  size  or  appearance  for  a  resonance

stone. They can be made from any mineral. Crystal, marble,

quartz, and precious gems are the most common materials.

In volume, they vary from the size of a pea (which would be

worn on a ring or necklace beneath the clothes) to the size of

a melon (powerful enough to  ood a small auditorium with

emotion). The largest known resonance stone is the great globe

suspended from the ceiling of the plaza in the illithid city of

Lagurno (see below), but it is exceptional in every way. The

average stone is around the size of a large egg.

Resonance stones are always active. Any sentient being that

approaches within the stones radius of effect experiences the

emotion that it broadcasts. At  rst, this sensation is faint. As

one draws nearer, the emotion rises quickly in intensity to the

imprinted level. If the stone is touched, the intensity jumps

up sharply.

Illithids use resonance stones casually as decorations. In

an illithids home, one could expect to  nd resonance stones

emitting  a  sense  of  deep  self-satisfaction,  pride,  feelings  of

personal superiority, or con dence. In public places, resonance

stones might be positioned to heighten feelings of responsibil-

ity, duty, loyalty, or racial superiority. At a performance eating

event (see Performance Eating Area, below), the performance

could be heightened through the use of stones that broadcast

a sense of anticipation, gradually changing to delight followed

by satisfaction.

To illithids, these emotions convey the same nostalgic con-

notations that smells carry for a human. The familiar feeling of

home has a literal meaning to a mind  ayer. Many can navigate

through their homes or even through public spaces by sensing

emotions only.

Besides  offering  a  pleasant  diversion,  resonance  stones

serve a vital function as well. A newly ceremorphosed mind

 ayer  has  no  experience  with  emotions.  When  it  suddenly

becomes sentient, its mind is bombarded with thoughts and

feelings from all directions. A nearby resonance stone calms

the tumult and  oods the creature with feelings of reassurance

and contentment. As it adjusts to its new body, develops psionic

powers, and acclimates to the unvarying presence of the elder

brain, a resonance stone, rather than a parent, is its constant

companion. In other words, mind  ayers learn emotions from

resonance stones, not from one another. They do not fall in

love or even form friendships beyond useful acquaintances.

Resonance stones  ll their emotional needs.

Resonance stones can be turned to darker, more destructive

purposes, too. Stones that radiate feelings of hopelessness and

helplessness are frequently used to keep newly captured prison-

ers docile before they can be enthralled. Similarly, stones that

radiate feelings of satisfaction and resignation can be scattered

across the  oor of a pit where captives are held, to keep them

quiet and prevent  ghting. A stone emitting horror, despair,

or surrender can be useful during interrogation.

Creatures subjected to a resonance stone effect can attempt

Will saves (save DC varies by stone type) to resist the effect. A

creature that succeeds on this save is immune to that stones

effect for 24 hours. A creature that fails the save but leaves the

area and reenters can attempt a new saving throw, but it takes

a 2 penalty on the second and all subsequent saving throws

made against the same resonance stone in the same 24-hour

period. Mind  ayers receive a +4 racial bonus on saves against

resonance stone effects.

Sample stones are presented below.

Resonance  Stone  of  Despair:  All  creatures  that  come

within 30 feet of this resonance stone must succeed on a DC

THE WHISPERING SHADOW

Of all questions surrounding illithids, Where did they come

from? is the most mysterious. For an answer to this riddle,

scholars are limited to scraps of clues from a handful of ancient

texts. The clearest reference is found in The Planetreaders Primer,

a book of primeval knowledge published (reputedly) in the

great city at the center of all, Sigil. It speaks in certain terms

of an illithid empire that spanned worlds in a time predat-

ing memory. So mighty was this empire that its expansion

threatened to consume even the eternal Blood War before it

was turned back.

The Astromundi Chronicles, a text of ancient yet unknown

origin, speaks of the illithids as a race of monstrous spawn,

hidden  beneath  the  world  by  their  progenitors.  No  clue  is

given as to the identity of these progenitors. The text suggests

that the illithids hated their creators with such passion that

they  lashed  out  against  them  and  destroyed  them  utterly,

leaving no trace of their existence for the modern scholar to

examine.

The most archaic of all sources is a set of stone tablets known

as the Sargonne Prophecies, named for the city of disturbing

ruins called Sargonne. The crumbling tablets contain passages

so cryptic that they have been interpreted as prophecies rather

than as history. Each bears a central likeness of what is unmis-

takably a mind  ayer. The inscribed runes present a troubling

aspect to the observer. They tell of an illithid world bathed in

eternal night that is destroyed by some  ery cataclysm, from

which the illithids  ee in  ying ships.

From  these  fragmentary  glimpses  into  the  dim  past  and

the  oral  histories  of  several  long-lived  races,  scholars  have

concocted the following history of the illithid race.

Its origin is simply unknown. Wherever they came from,

in time so ancient that no record of it exists, illithids ruled a

vast, worlds-spanning empire.

This empire, built on a foundation of slavery and domina-

tion over whatever other races existed at that time, dwarfed

everything  that  has  come  since.  At  some  point,  certain  of

those enslaved races developed a degree of resistance to the

psychic  shackles  of  the  illithids.  When  they  had  gathered

suf cient power, the slaves revolted. How it was done no one

can say, but the slaves succeeded in toppling their masters and

winning free. The age that followed was one of unrelenting

revenge  as  desperate  pockets  of  illithids  were  hunted  and

exterminated.

The  freed  slaves  were  not  free  of  strife,  and  they  fell  to

warring  among  themselves.  This  had  two  effects.  First,  the

feuding branches of ex-slaves became what are now known as

the githyanki and the githzerai, who make war on each other

to this day. Second, the illithids that eluded their vengeance

were  able  to  regroup  and  escape  to  defensible  fortresses

deep underground, where the gith races chose not to pursue

them.

This account is basically true in its outline but is  awed in

one astounding respect. While the rebellion of the gith did

indeed take place in the pastabout two thousand years ago,

to be precisetheir mind  ayer masters had themselves just

arrived in that era from the unimaginable future.

At the very end of time, the mind  ayers faced extinction at

the hands of some unknown adversary. Caught in the throes

of defeat, harried in their crumbling capitals and universities

(lesser  outposts  had  fallen  eons  before),  the  surviving  illi-

thids concocted a desperate plan. As their last bastions were

assailed and their psychic defenses breached, the mind  ayers

sacri ced countless ancient, potent elder brains to produce a

psionic maelstrom of unimaginable proportions. The ensuing

cacophony of energy demolished the very laws that support

the structure of time. The illithids and all that remained of

their decadent civilization were hurled backward across the

ravaged barriers separating the ages to arrive in the present

world, but thousands of years ago, as recorded in the Sargonne

Prophecies.

The illithids staggering gamble paid off. Upon arriving in

the human world of several thousand years past, they quickly

enslaved  the  humanoid  race  known  as  the  gith,  seeking  to

reestablish their empire in their new age. After centuries of

servitude,  the  gith  successfully  rebelled  against  the  mind

 ayers. Much of the knowledge and wondrous magic brought

to the distant past from the illithid empire at the end of time

was destroyed in this rebellion, and for long years the mind

 ayers were scattered and disorganized in its wake.

While the rebellion of the gith was a great catastrophe, the

mind  ayers are a patient race. They need only wait in the dark-

ness, planning, correcting foreseen mistakes, and gathering

strength for the time when they return to ascendance.

In  the  impossibly  far  future,  when  stars  are  reduced  to

pale,  red  cinders   ickering  coldly  over  somnolent  worlds,

the illithids will rise from their subterranean dens to face the

languid twilight and establish once more the empire they lost.

They will be stronger, crueler, and hungrier than ever, and all

hope will die.

LANGUAGE

Mind  ayers have no spoken language of their own. Among

themselves, they communicate entirely by means of telepathy

accented  with  tentacle  motions.  At   rst,  their  telepathy  is

short-ranged  and  limited  to  creatures  within  their  line  of

sight. As a mind  ayer matures, it gains much greater control

and power, plus the ability to maintain communication with

multiple minds at once.

Mind   ayers  understand  and  can  speak  Undercommon,

when verbal communication is necessary. Due to their high

intelligence, most mind  ayers know a number of other lan-

guages, toousually Common, Elven, Aquan, and Infernal.

While they despise speaking any language aloud, mind  ayers

 nd it useful to be able to read texts produced by humans or

by their common subterranean rivals, aboleths and drow.

Mind  ayers use a unique written language known as Qual-

ith. Qualith has no spoken form; it is a record of pure telepathic

communication. Qualith script resembles four parallel lines of

raised dashes and spaces, intended to be read by touch. Each

line carries an independent train of thought, but to understand

the message, all four lines must be read simultaneously. The

cadence of the writing attempts to capture the rhythm and

sensation of multilayered telepathic communication. The effect

is nearly impossible for nonillithids to understand or translate

without years of study (DC 35 Decipher Script check).

Qualith script is common throughout most illithid archi-

tecture.  In  many  cases,  it  runs  in  unbroken  expanses  on

every  wall.  Explorers  and  intruders  who  dont  understand

the signi cance of the geometrical markings mistake them

for religious symbols or decorative carvings.

RELIGION

Illithid religion differs from most theologies in that it lacks any

concern with the afterlife. Mind  ayers know what becomes of

them when they diethey meld with the elder brain. Instead,

mind  ayers revere a deity whose philosophies mirror their

own: that knowledge is the greatest commodity, darkness the

greatest illumination, the mind the greatest power, and illithids

the greatest race. They have such a deity in Ilsensine.

Ilsensine resides in the vast Caverns of Thought beneath the

surface of the Concordant Domain of the Outlands. It has no

physical body but manifests itself as cohesive thought in the

shape of a gigantic, pulsing brain. Ganglia of in nite length

trail outward in all directions from its glowing shape and reach

to all corners of existence. Through these ganglia, Ilsensine

taps all the knowledge that is. It peers into the minds of the

greatest sages of all dimensions, saps fading memories from

the desiccating brains of dead wizards, and stares across space

and time itself to learn all there is to know. Of everything it

surveys, it judges the mind  ayers as the most worthy of mortal

creatures.

Mind  ayers do not worship Ilsensine in

the same sense that humans or elves  worship

their  deities.  They  revere  the  god  for  its

gigantic,  all- sensing

mental  capacity.  To

them,  Ilsensine  is

the  ultimate  form

of  what  an  elder

brain  aspires  to

be  and  might

become,  in  the

fullness  of  un-

countable  eons

of  growth.  The

illithids  envy  its

vast  knowledge,

which  in  practi-

cal  terms  appears

limitless.  They  en-

treat Ilsensine for favors

and  even  supplicate  it,

but their innate, over-

powering  egoism

prevents any true

worship.

The  priest-

hood of Il sen sine

is  small  and  se-

lective.  Illithid

clerics  live

monastical-

ly, pursuing

knowledge

for  its  own  sake  and  en-

gaging  in  experiments

to  develop  new  psionic

powers.  Through  their

worship,  they  enlist  the

aid  of  all-sensing  Ilsen-

sine,  who  knows  things

that  are  hidden  even  to  the

elder brains.

Mind   ayer  priests  are  not  reviled  the  way  wizards  (and

especially sorcerers) are, but they dont mix with illithid soci-

ety. They rarely leave their temples except when conducting

important ceremonies.

Taking  a  cue  from  Ilsensine,  the  clerics  sometimes  use

cranium  rats  (see  page  167  of  the  Fiend  Folio)  as  spies  or  to

convey messages across long distances. When Ilsensine needs

to intervene directly in material affairs, it most often sends its

proxy, Lugribossk.

Clerics of Ilsensine can choose from the Evil, Knowl-

edge, Law, Magic, or Mind domains (see Chapter 9).

They rebuke undead.

RELATIONS WITH

OTHER RACES

A githyanki  ghter

duels a

mind  ayer

Mind   ayers  have  no  friends.  If

an  illithid  treats  a  creature  of

another  race  as  an  equal,  it

is pretending friendship.

Other races are useful

when  they  bring

information  and

trade  goods.

U l t i m a t e -

l y,  illithids

have  only

two  ways  of  interacting  with  other

races: enslavement and consump-

tion. If an illithid treats a drow or

a duergar respectfully (never defer-

entially), it is doing so only to serve its

own purposes.

Of  all  races,  mind   ayers  have

special  enmity  for  githyanki  and

githzerai. Both of these races

hunt illithids. Mind  ayers

show them no mercy and re-

ceive none in exchange.

The  only  creatures  that

illithids fear are undead, be-

cause they have no minds to

dominate. Undead cannot

be  psionically  detected,

cannot be attacked with

mind-affecting pow-

ers,  and  cannot  be

slain  by  the  remov-

al  of

the

brainall

characteristics  that

make them pecu-

liarly dangerous

to mind  ayers.

The Threat of the Gith

The githyanki and githzerai are implacable foes of both their

former  illithid  masters  and  of  each  other.  The  relationship

between these three races is one of millennia-long animosity

and violence.

In a very literal sense, the mind  ayers created the githyanki

and githzerai. They are the ultimate result of generations of

selective breeding of illithid thralls. The base race from which

these two derived is unknown; gith progenitors might have

been  brought  to  the  distant  past  from  the  illithid  empire

at times end, or they might have simply been a race of the

mundane world captured during the  rst great mind  ayer

incursion from the future. Even the gith do not know. In any

event, they are now suf ciently removed from their origins

that the base stock is of interest only to historians.

The githyanki and githzerai are more similar than either

race ever admits. There can be no doubt that at some time, not

that long ago (in absolute terms), these two races were actu-

ally one. The split actually occurred after the gith won their

freedom from the mind  ayers. The schism that divided them

into two camps was philosophical and social, not racial. The

hatred that it spawned was so intense, and still runs so deep in

both societies, that they cant coexist on the same plane. The

githyanki have chosen to live in drifting fortresses secreted

on the Astral Plane, while the githzerai hide their monasteries

in Limbo.

From these strongholds, both races foray to the Material

Plane to seek vengeance on the mind  ayers. The githyanki are

primarily a race of warriors and wizards, while the githzerai

favor the monk and rogue classes. While it is clear to outsiders

how much these two groups could help each other, the thought

is anathema to them. If githzerai encounter githyanki, they

gleefully slaughter each other. Only the immediate opportu-

nity to slay their common foe causes them to stop  ghting and

work together.

This animosity serves the mind  ayers well. If the gith ever

were  to  unite,  combining  their  unique  strengths  and  their

vast knowledge of the planes, the future would look bleak for

mind  ayers. Clearly it is in the illithids best interest to keep

their two most relentless foes at each others throats as long

as possible. Speci cally, the mind  ayers take steps to prevent

their enemies from becoming too numerous or too powerful.

They recruit spies among the githzerai and githyanki: members

of those races who, through blackmail or a desire for vengeance,

have turned against their own people. These agents not only

keep the mind  ayers informed about their enemies plans,

but also continue to stir the coals of racial hatred, assuring

that the two races remain separate. The illithids, on the other

hand,  are  immune  from  such  machinations,  thanks  to  the

all-sensing elder brains. No spy could operate for long within

a mind  ayer community without being uncovered, and the

punishment would be the simplest and most effective of all:

death without joining the elder brain.

Thralls

Illithid communities are  lled with slaves or, more correctly,

thralls. Thralls do all menial work in illithid society. They are

the  household  servants,  public  workers,  and  draft  animals.

They  even   ll  the  ranks  of  the  mind   ayer  armies,  where

their role is largely to serve as cannon fodder while power-

ful illithids wreak havoc on the enemy with mind blasts and

mental domination.

Newly  captured  slaves  are  subjected  to  inspection  and

disinfection, followed by constant psychic bombardment to

ensure  that  they  become  docile  and  willing  thralls.  Those

lucky few who managed to escape from thralldom describe

it as a waking nightmare. The slave is always aware of what

he is doing and is  lled with revulsion at his deeds, but is

powerless to resist illithid commands. The hopelessness and

horror of this mental captivity bears down on the thrall as a

constant weight.

Many thralls are captured in raids, but not all. Some are

bred selectively for strength, docility, or even coloration or

height.

Few thralls die of natural causes. Most become meals for

their masters. Their usefulness doesnt end at death, either.

The  bodies  (minus  the  brains,  of  course)  are  fed  back  to

other thralls.

In  addition  to  the  tasks  they  perform,  thralls  provide

another  service  to  their  masters.  Illithids  have  a  need  to

dominate lesser creatures and take great pride in the quantity

and quality of their own personal thralls. An illithid with an

especially valuable or exotic thrall enjoys great prestige among

its peers, while an illithid without thralls is considered weak

and incompetent.

MIND FLAYER GOALS

Mind   ayer  society  is  unique  in  that  illithids  know  their

destiny is to dominate the universe. Illithids are not foolish

enough to believe that the future cannot be changed, however,

so they are not complacent. They know that the githyanki and

githzerai in particular might inadvertently alter the future by

destroying the illithid race.

Elder brains excel at seeing the big picture. They take a long

view that exceeds most races lifetimes. Their active schemes

might involve plans that wont reach fruition for decades or

centuries. This sort of long-range planning makes it nearly

impossible for outsiders to deduce what a group of mind  ay-

ers is planning. Sometimes, the mind  ayers themselves dont

entirely understand why the elder brain instructs them to do

certain things.

In the short term, though, mind  ayers work toward a few

recognizable goals.

They oppose and kill githyanki and githzerai wherever and

whenever they locate them.

They establish links to nonillithids who can be of service

to them while scouting others as potential targets for raids.

They  seek  to  maintain  a  steady  influx  of  brains  for

nourishment.

They expand their knowledge in every area. Only through

knowledge  can  they  make  accurate  predictions  about  the

future.

eventual  rise.  Rather,  they  interfere  with  growing  empires

experimentally.  In  this,  the  whole  surface  world  is  their

laboratory.  By  meddling  in  surface  politics  to  bring  about

governmental collapse, mind  ayers hope to learn what pitfalls

to guard against when erecting their own empire.

The longest-range and most ambitious plan of all is to  nd a

means of extinguishing the sun. Mind  ayers arent harmed by

sunlight, but they hate it and avoid it at all costs. If the world

could be plunged into darkness, the illithids could expand

from their subterranean lairs onto the surface, where all the

best brains are to be found.

THE FLOW OF FRESH BRAINS

The peculiar dietary needs of the illithids generate a signi cant

barrier to maintaining ties with other races. Falling into the

clutches  of  the  mind   ayers  ensures  a  horrendous  fate.  No

matter how the mind  ayers encourage necessary trade with

other races, no one should ever forget that illithids must devour

brains directly from the skulls of living victims to survive.

How do they maintain a suf cient supply?

A mind  ayer must have a minimum of one fresh brain per

month. Any less than that and it suffers physical debilitation,

becoming so weak that it could die. Its ideal diet is one brain

per week. A mind  ayer that consumes one brain a week does

not feel deprived. It can eat more than that for enjoyment and

for the psychic boost, and it will if brains are plentiful.

Typically, mind  ayers consume somewhere between the

minimum of one brain per month and the ideal of one brain per

week, averaging one brain every two weeks and supplement-

ing their diet with other foods. This doesnt sound like much,

but consider the effect of a community of one hundred mind

 ayers. To maintain their health, they need  fty brains a week,

or 2,600 brains a year. Maintaining that supply is the most

important and dif cult task facing an illithid community.

The  need  for  consumable  brains  is  the  chief  reason  why

mind  ayer communities tend to be small. Large communities

(one hundred or more illithids) are rare. Cities of up to two

thousand are even more so. They are so rare, in fact, that sages

consider them fables.

To maintain their diet, mind  ayers rely on three methods:

breeding their own supply, taking the brains of intruders, and

brain raids.

Breeding Their Own Supply

Illithids maintain large stocks of thralls, and few die natural

deaths. The mind  ayers needs cannot be met entirely through

stocks  of  slaves,  however.  The  races  that  produce  desirable

brains  mature  too  slowly  to  be  ef cient  livestock.  Using

humans  as  an  example,  and  assuming  that  a  human  brain

reaches  ripeness  at  the  age  of  twenty,  each  illithid  would

need more than 250 slaves just to assure its own minimum

food supply. Even a small outpost of twenty illithids would

need  ve thousand human slaves in its feed lots, and a third

to a half of them would be too young for heavy work. For a

healthier diet, that number doubles, and it quadruples for an

ideal diet. The logistics behind such a massive program make

it impossible.

Other races mature faster than humans. Goblins, orcs, and

grimlocks, for example, reach consumable age in one-half to

two-thirds of the time it takes a human . . . but they are not

nearly as desirable as food.

Besides  the  logistic  issues,  the  brains  of  lifelong  thralls

are  less  satisfying  to  mind   ayers  than  the  brains  of  free

individuals. A thrall has few true experiences to remember

and even fewer emotions, which are the meat and potatoes

of a nourishing, ful lling mind.

Preying on Intruders

The  second  method  for  maintaining  a  supply  of  brains

involves pouncing on intruders that wander too near illithid

strongholds: roving monsters, imprudent traders, and, best

of all, adventure-seeking heroes. While the active, experi-

ence- and magic- lled minds of adventurers are considered

among  the  tastiest  of  all,  they  are  few  and  far  between.

Harvesting  such  brains  involves  considerably  more  than

an average level of danger. Wizards and paladins who come

armed  with  potent  spells  and  magical  weapons  put  up  a

strong  ght. The greatest drawback to this method is that

intrusions occur too infrequently to be more than a happy

surprise for mind  ayers.

Brain Raids

The thirdand only reliablesolution for illithids is to cap-

ture the brains they need through constant, aggressive raids.

Brain  raids  can  be  far-ranging,  since  illithids  prefer  not

to  depopulate  their  immediate  vicinity.  They  prey  on  both

the  subterranean  and  sunlit  worlds.  Below  ground,  their

favored  targets  are  drow,  kuo-toas,  duergar,  deep  dwarves,

deep hal ings, and derro (chie y because of their delusions

of  grandeur,  which  lend  their  brains  a  pleasing  tanginess).

Goblins,  hobgoblins,  and  grimlocks  are  consumed  when

necessary, and sometimes become staple foods, but they are

not highly rated due to their mundane intelligence and lack of

imagination. Creatures such as umber hulks and xorns become

illithid food from time to time, but more for their exotic nature

than anything else. Illithids avoid eating troglodytes in all but

life-or-death emergencies.

The  surface,  with  its  wealth  of  warm-blooded  humanoid

races,  provides  better  hunting.  Humans,  hal ings,  elves,

and  dwarves  are  the  most  prized.  Orcs,  goblins,  ogres,  and

hobgoblins that live on the surface are regarded more highly

than their subterranean cousins. Sprites, nymphs, satyrs, and

other faerie creatures are hard-to-catch delicacies.

Raids  come  in  two  varieties,  distinguished  by  whether

the goal is food or captives. Food raids are easy to organize

and  short  in  duration.  A  few  mind   ayers  marshal  their

psychoportive powers to teleport or travel astrally to a target

location. Once there, they either set up an ambush or burst in

upon their victims for maximum surprise. After feeding, they

return home and the raid is over.

Such raids have wiped out entire villages over the course of

months when several mind  ayers decide to return repeatedly

to the same location to feed. Ten mind  ayers, each taking a

victim a week, kill one hundred and thirty people in a single

season. Because they almost always take the strongest  rst, a

villages ability to resist (typically inadequate to begin with)

can be wiped out before the inhabitants even understand whats

attacking them. Once the leaders and strongest warriors are

gone,  those  who  dont   ee  to  safer  havens  live  only  until  a

raiding illithid tracks them down.

Mind  ayers are careful to cover their tracks. They dont

leave bodies lying about with emptied skulls to testify to the

identity  of  the  attackers.  A  town  under  this  kind  of  mind

 ayer attack simply experiences mysterious disappearances.

Knowledgeable hunters of illithids can estimate the number

of illithids involved by counting the disappearances in a week,

assuming that all the missing are reported (which might not

be the case in a city or large town).

From the raiders perspective, raids for captives prove much

more complex and require a great deal of logistical planning.

The  chief  problems  include  the  dif culty  of  transporting

thralls to the site of the raid (since thralls are needed to round

up and manage the captives), and the means of bringing the

captives  back  to  the  mind   ayers  home  without  suffering

reprisal attacks.

These tasks are typically beyond the mind  ayers psychic

capability. Too many people are involved. For a raid projected

to capture one hundred able-bodied adults, mind  ayers would

want  to  bring  along  at  least  twenty  thralls,  and  possibly  as

many as  fty if resistance is expected. For a raid targeted at a

town 200 miles from the illithids home base, a sizable caravan

must travel undetected to the raid site and then home again

with unwilling captives in tow. On the outward journey, the

target could be reached in four days, but the return journey

involves much greater danger. The captives are driven hard

to cover 30 or 40 miles a day. To keep the caravan light, they

are fed very little. Many die of exhaustion, exposure, or grief

along the way. A hundred-captive caravan racing 200 miles to

safety might expect to lose as many as half its captives by the

time it reaches its destination.

Such an undertaking carried out on the surface and through

inevitable cycles of day and night exposes mind  ayers to much

greater danger than they are willing to accept. To reduce the

danger, they seldom travel with the captives. Herding is left

in the hands of conditioned thralls. The illithids use psionic

or magical means to travel instantly and safely. They might

check on the caravan nightly, when they feel more secure on

the surface. Otherwise, they are unlikely to be found in the

company of a slave caravan.

To improve the odds of bringing in a large batch of slaves

ef ciently, raiders travel below ground as much as possible.

Twisting caverns beneath the surface are more extensive than

most surface dwellers realize. By planning their raids carefully

and  undertaking  some  judicious  engineering,  mind   ayers

can restrict the distance their raiders need to travel on the

surface to a few miles. Emerging from natural or thrall-dug

cave openings, the thrall warriors and their illithid overlords

strike  a  village  in  the  darkness,  slaughter  indiscriminately

to spread terror and subdue the survivors, round up the best

men and women, and, with a hard push, are back underground

again before the sun comes up. To militias and feudal leaders

unfamiliar  with  mind   ayers  and  their  tactics,  such  a  raid

appears as a terrifying and inexplicable incident.

By  sticking  to  meandering,  subterranean  pathways,  the

raiders might lengthen their journey by a hundred miles or

more. The added travel time is well worth it for the greater

security and chance of success that it provides. If pursuers

follow the captives into the underground, they must deal with

mind  ayers on the illithids own termsnever an attractive

proposition.

EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE

Mind  ayers gather knowledge in four ways: They purchase it

from traveling merchants, steal it directly from the minds of

traveling merchants, absorb it from the brains of their victims,

or  read  it  from  the  minds  of  their  captives.  None  of  these

methods are ever used in isolation. More than any other race,

mind  ayers are aware of the ways in which faulty perception

and personal interpretation can distort facts. They always seek

to verify important information with multiple sources.

Mind  ayers are most interested in news about happenings

on the surface of the world, what the drow are plotting, any-

thing having to do with githyanki or githzerai, news involving

their  own  activities,  and  important  astrological  or  magical

discoveries. They are interested in everything else, too, but

these subjects command their attention.

INTERFERING IN POLITICS

Few surface dwellers understand how and why mind  ayers

involve themselves in the affairs of surface realms. Most would

be even more surprised to learn that the illithid in uence is not

entirely negative. Mind  ayers have been known to intervene

to prop up failing governments or aid weaker societies against

encroachment or invasion by someone stronger. Of course,

its impossible to aid one society in that way without acting

at another societys expense, so positive in uence depends

on the point of view. If a society is plunged into anarchy and

desolation to allow another to expand, the interference that

brought about that change of fortune can hardly be considered

positive.

Mind  ayers  nd it surprisingly easy to in uence surface

politics, using their tremendous psionic ability to read and

implant thoughts. Their machinations are always behind the

scenes. They alter the mind of a king or queen directly when

that  sovereign  is  strong,  or  they  work  through  the  minds

of  advisers  and  sages  when  a  monarch  is  weak-willed.  The

reverse  experiment  is  also  a  worthy  exercise:  in uencing  a

strong-willed  monarch  through  his  councilors,  and  adding

decisiveness and purpose to weak rulers.

The extent of this manipulation is impossible for surface

dwellers to judge. Few ever become aware of it, and they are

seldom in a position to do anything about it. In cases where a

seemingly healthy monarch or noble abruptly begins acting

in a way irreconcilable from his or her established beliefs, the

possible cause might lie beyond senility, madness, or demonic

possession. A wise court wizard would do well to guard his

sovereign against mental manipulation.

Contrary to what some believe, illithid motivation for med-

dling in surface politics does not involve creating chaos or

instability for its own sake; that is mainly a side bene t, from

their perspective. In truth, the elder brains seek to understand

the dynamics of the rise and fall of kingdoms, empires, and

civilizations.  The  history  of  their  own,  original  rise  from

obscurity to universal domination is lost to themthey dont

know how they did it the  rst time. Now that they have been

given a second opportunity, they intend to maximize their

chances of doing it right and making it last forever. To that end,

they want to explore every pitfall, every catastrophic decision,

and every nuance of rule, warfare, diplomacy, and governance

through surface proxies.

EXTINGUISHING THE SUN

The idea that the mind  ayers are destined to one day rule

the  universe  is  alarming  enough.  Even  more  horrifying  is

the  thought  that  they  might   rst  reshape  the  universe  to

make it more amenable to their purposes and to hasten their

ascendance.

Their  peers  might  consider  them  insane,  but  a  few  elder

brains actively work toward the goal of putting out the sun.

They draw their inspiration from the massive psychic detona-

tion that hurled the remnants of their civilization backward

through eons of time. If concentrated, focused psionics could

accomplish  that,  they  reason,  why  couldnt  it  accomplish

something else just as cataclysmic?

Rational minds counter that while the jump back in time

was necessary, it was also drastic beyond measure, could easily

have failed with catastrophic results, and left such destruction

in its wake that centuries would be needed before the surviv-

ing mind  ayers were able to establish their dominance again.

In other words, the risks outweigh the potential gain, since

the sun and other stars will burn out on their own without

aid  from  the  mind   ayers.  All  thats  needed  to  bring  about

universal darkness is patience.

Because this plot  nds little acceptance among the wider

illithid community, elder brains that pursue it do so quietly.

In some cases, they keep their agenda hidden even from the

mind  ayers that serve them. Only a few of the most fanatical

societies work openly for this goal. Most mind  ayers acknowl-

edge that it would be a tremendous accomplishment, but they

simply believe that it cannot be done.

As a counterpoint, some illithids believe it would be more

realistic to  nd ways for their race to exist comfortably and

function effectively in daylight. This type of practical thinking

enjoys greater acceptance among mind  ayers, even though

most cannot imagine living in the light without protective

gear. Being immersed in sunlight is nearly as horrifying to an

illithid as is the thought of drowning in blood to a human.

LAGURNO, ILLITHID SEPT

Lagurno is a typical mind  ayer community. The description

below covers details of this speci c sept (hidden city) as well

as general characteristics of other illithid communities.

Lagurno consists of two distinct sections: Upper Lagurno,

the  duergar  village  that  most  visitors  encounter   rst,  and

Hidden  Lagurno,  which  lies  almost  200  feet  below,  linked

by spiraling secret ramps. The duergar village is home to the

mind  ayers thralls. It also serves as a red herring to throw

off anyone searching for evidence of the illithids presence.

APPROACHING THE CITY

Mind   ayer  communities  place  a  high  premium  on  stout

defenses. Illithids have few friends and many enemies who

would go to great lengths to destroy a mind  ayer town or kill

an elder brain. Lagurno is no exception to this rule, and the

illithids of the community vigilantly maintain their defenses

against attack.

Thrall Patrols (EL 10)

Illithids regularly patrol the tunnels and passages leading to

Lagurno. Mind  ayers frequently lead these patrols, but if they

determine that they need to conceal their presence for a time,

they  dispatch  patrols  consisting  of  nothing  but  dominated

thralls, counting on the power of their mental abilities to hold

the thralls to their exacting orders.

A typical patrol consists of the following creatures:

Mind Flayer: hp 44; Monster Manual page 186.

Minotaur: hp 39; Monster Manual page 188.

Duergar  Sergeant  (Fighter  4):  hp  34;  Monster  Manual

page 92.

Duergar  Warrior  (Warrior  1)  (5):  hp  9  each;  Monster

Manual page 92.

Urophions (EL 12 to 14)

The passages in the immediate vicinity of Lagurno are guarded

by  urophions,  horrible  illithid  ropers.  Urophions  lay  their

ambushes in areas where passages become narrow, twisting,

and rough, with mazelike side passages winding into darkness.

The correct path might be easy enough to follow by the signs of

passage on the stone  oor, but the constricted tunnels heavily

favor the urophions.

About half the time, a urophion operates in solitude. The

rest of the time, two or more urophions work in concert. These

groups  are  much  more  dangerous.  They  allow  intruders  to

move past the  rst urophions; the last one springs the ambush,

then the others seal off the route of escape.

Inquisitions (EL 14)

If the mind  ayers of Lagurno become aware of an intrusion into

their  hidden city, as opposed to adventurers bumbling around in

the passages around the thrall village, they quickly and ef ciently

organize inquisitions to hunt down and destroy the intruders.

A  typical  inquisition  in  Hidden  Lagurno  consists  of  the

following creatures:

Mind Flayer (4): hp 44 each; Monster Manual page 186.

Troll Hunter: hp 130; Monster Manual page 247.

Troll (2): hp 63 each; Monster Manual page 247.

The Final Defense

The last line of defense for the community is the elder brain

itself. The elder brain constantly scans passages and tunnels

in and surrounding the city with its divination magic, looking

for any living, thinking creatures. If it  nds sentient beings

that it cannot recognize or identify, it mobilizes active defenses

against the intruders.

As long as intruders remain outside the elder brains zone

of telepathic awareness (more than 350 feet from the brain, in

other words), standard defenses against scrying magic should

serve to conceal them from its searching mind. The elder brain

is an exceptionally potent psion, and its divinations are power-

ful enough to shatter simple defenses such as nondetection.

Within the elder brains zone of telepathic awareness, there

are few ways to avoid being detected. Standard defenses against

clairvoyance and clairsentience dont work because the elder brain

doesnt search for visual or audio clues; it scans for thought.

The  only  effective  defense  is  one  that  shields  a  characters

thoughts from any sort of detection, not just mind reading.

The following spells are useful or useless against an elder

brain as noted.

Antimagic Field: This spell blocks an elder brains detection

entirely. Creatures protected by an antimagic  eld are completely

hidden. The chief drawback of this defense is its high level and

short duration.

Detect  Scrying:  This  spell  does  not  help  against  the  elder

brains telepathic awareness, because the elder brains ability

is not a divination (scrying) effect.

False Vision: This spell offers no protection because the elder

brain isnt looking into an area and cant be fooled by images.

The spell doesnt mask the users thoughts, so it has no effect

in this case.

Globe of Invulnerability: This spell has no effect against an

elder  brains  detection  because  the  elder  brains  telepathic

awareness is a supernatural ability.

Mind Blank: This spell is perfect for masking one creature

against detection by an elder brain for 24 hours. It is the best

defense available when facing mind  ayers. Its biggest draw-

back is the need for a high-level spellcaster.

Nondetection: While this spell is potentially effective against

the elder brains telepathic awareness, a spellcaster must be

very high in level to resist an elder brains caster level check.

Psionic powers that might be tried in an attempt to block

an elder brains detection include the following:

Conceal Thoughts: Since the elder brains telepathic awareness

offers no saving throw, conceal thoughts does not help.

Detect Remote Viewing: Telepathic awareness is not a clairsen-

tience power but a supernatural ability, so this power does not

help.

Mind Blank, Personal or Psionic: The psionic power, like the

spell of the same name, is the best protection possible against

an elder brain or a mind  ayer. Also as with the spell, its biggest

drawback is its high level.

Null Psionics Field: This  eld blocks the elder brains probing

and has the capacity to shield multiple individuals.

Power Resistance: Telepathic awareness is not a power and

therefore not subject to power resistance (or spell resistance,

for that matter).

Remote View Trap: This power offers no protection against an

elder brains telepathic awareness, but if the brain attempts to

use a scrying power to view the intruders, it becomes subject

to the spells effect.

Suspend Life: A character under the effect of this power is

undetectable as anything but a corpse. A character could be

suspended, and then smuggled into a mind  ayer compound.

This unorthodox approach could work.

UPPER LAGURNO

Upper Lagurno appears as a normal duergar village in most

respects. Huts of stone with moss roofs crowd the center of

town. On the lower side, a collecting pool stores water that

drips from overhanging stalactites. Animals are penned or kept

in sunken pits. Mushrooms grow abundantly in side caverns.

In  other  words,  nothing  readily  apparent  about  the  village

alerts anyone that its more than meets the eye.

Almost every illithid community uses its thralls as a form

of camou age. Because the mind  ayers rarely linger in the

thrall village without good reason, travelers logically assume

that the duergar (in this case) are the masters of the place.

The entrance to the illithids deeper lair might be hidden

inside a home, a temple, a well, a protected cave, or another

secret location. It is designed to blend into the site and not

stand  out  or  attract  attention  as  an  unusual  structure.  It

wont necessarily be the biggest, cleanest, strongest, or best-

protected edi ce in the village. The entry point to the mind

 ayer community proper is always guarded (from the inner

side)  by  illithids  that  visually  inspect  and  mentally  scan

everyone seeking entrance. Three illithids remain on hand

to  perform  this  vital  service  at  the  entry  point  to  Hidden

Lagurno at all times. The job rotates among members of the

community, and they consider it a high honor to perform

the duty well.

All the duergar in the village of Lagurno are thralls. The

population  of  the  village  is  about  300,  including  125  adult

males, 105 adult females, and 70 juveniles.

HIDDEN LAGURNO

Below  Upper  Lagurno  lies  the  mind   ayer  sept  known  as

Hidden Lagurno. Few nonillithids who set foot in the spiraling

tunnels descending to Hidden Lagurno leave it againexcept

as mind-dominated thralls.

Hidden Lagurno is virtually lightless. The mind  ayers need

no  illumination,  and  they  hate  its

presence. The only lighting is

for the bene t of thralls, and its very dim in areas frequented

by mind  ayers.

Those with the ability to see the mind  ayers architecture

discern dripping walls carved in twisting, writhing patterns

reminiscent of tentacles twining around themselves. Moisture

glistens everywhere. Thralls shuf e listlessly here and there,

apparently carrying out errands but with no sense of urgency.

Silence reigns.

Upper levels of structures are accessible by ramps and stairs,

even  though  not  all  illithids  need  them.  Sprinkled  about

the  area  seemingly  at  random  are  stocks  built  to  restrain  a

humanoid creature by clamping down on its neck

and wrists. Observers might realize with some

horror that these are the mind  ayer equivalent

of dining tables.

Although  a  small  community

(Lagurno  houses  only  a  few

hundred illithids and about

three  times  that  many

thralls, who live in the

upper village), Lagur-

no  covers  a  large

area.  Passageways

are  broad  and

seem  to  stretch

for  needlessly

long distances be-

tween  areas.  Mind

 ayers like to have a

lot  of  personal  space.

They enjoy solitude where

they can be alone with only

their  thoughts  and  the  el-

der  brains  omnipresence.

The  vast  hallways  provide

them with solitude in their

self-imposed  con nement

below ground.

Central Plaza

Illithid  communities  or-

ganize  around  a  central

plaza. Its not known if this

has  always  been

so or if its an

outgrowth of

their current

subterranean

existence.

The cen-

tral  plaza  is

large by subterra-

nean  standards,

but despite the

opulence, an air of ancient decadence hangs over the scene,

heightened by the forms of illithids moving silently or con-

versing  wordlessly,  their  tentacles  writhing  in  a  sickening

dance.

The main feature of the plaza is a great fountain surrounded

by  a  pool.  Smaller  fountains  and  pools  are  arranged  sym-

metrically around the primary fountain. Some of these serve

as baths for illithids to keep themselves clean and their skin

moist. Others, especially fountains with wide sprays, primarily

function to keep humidity high in the cavern.

The walls and pillars of the chamber are carved so that they

seem to undulate beneath their glistening layer of dampness.

Ramps circle the walls, leading up to doorways and overhang-

ing balconies.

The walls of this spacious chamber are honeycombed with

the illithids individual dwellings. Every illithid, even the

very youngest, has its own living space. The size and loca-

tion of each space varies according to status. Living spaces at

ground level are reserved for the most esteemed: community

leaders, favorites of the elder brain, the most powerful psions

and wizards, great hunters, and even popular performance

eaters. As the living spaces rise above the level of the plaza,

they  become  smaller,  less  intricate,  and  less  prestigious.

Top-level  spaces  are  small,  roughly  excavated,  and  meant

for young illithids. Ironically, the highest spaces go to those

least capable of reaching them, and the lowest to those that

dont truly need their convenience. This is the elder brains

concept of motivation.

Balconies and walkways all around the walls of the plaza

connect by spiraling ramps, but illithids with the power to

levitate  oat majestically to the levels of their living spaces.

To an outside observer (assuming he could see anything in

the gloom), an illithid plaza is unnerving not only because

of its alien, organic-seeming architecture, but because of its

unearthly silence. Mind  ayers in  owing robes walk slowly

along the ramps or  oat telekinetically from level to level while

others drift languorously in dark, indifferent pools of steaming

liquid, all in near-complete silence. Only the splashing of the

fountains and the occasional grunt or scream of a thrall being

punishedor devouredbreaks the hush.

At any given time, about twenty mind  ayers mill about in

this plaza, with thirty more in their living spaces. Approxi-

mately the same number of thralls attends them. While thralls

are scarce in many parts of Hidden Lagurno, they outnumber

illithids in the plaza because common thrall errands (carrying

messages, stonework, menial labor, and meal service) bring

them here.

Fresh Capture Pit

From time to time, large numbers of captives are brought en

masse to an illithid stronghold. The spells and psionic abilities

that transform a captive into a thrall include dif cult, high-level

powers. Enthralling  fty or more captives is a time-consuming

process; it could take weeks before all are broken.

While their wills are still free, captives are con ned in a

pit about 20 feet deep and 100 feet wide with smooth, vertical

sides slick from condensation. The only way in or out is to be

raised or lowered telekinetically or, if a suitably powerful mind

 ayer is not available to perform the telekinesis, by a winch

operated by thralls.

In  Hidden  Lagurno,  the  duergar,  drow,  and  grimlocks

con ned to the pit live a truly wretched existence:  lthy, half

starved, and sometimes packed in so tightly that there is no

room  to  lie  down  or  even  sit  comfortably.  They  mill  about

weakly or lie in the  lth covering the  oor. They  nd release

from the pit only if selected for enthrallment, experimentation,

ceremorphosis, to become a meal, or for some other twisted

illithid purpose. The greatest number remains in the pit until

they are eventually eaten. Depending on the kind of creatures

trapped, lethal battles and even cannibalism occur, especially

when the supplied food and water are insuf cient.

The pit in Hidden Lagurno can accommodate two hundred

captives without being stacked to capacity, or three times that

number if they are packed in tightly. On a day-to-day basis, the

typical occupancy reaches one hundred to one hundred and

 fty captives.

Thrall Barracks

Most of the duergar live in Upper Lagurno, serving as cam-

ou age  for  the  mind   ayer  settlement  beneath.  The  mind

 ayers  of  Hidden  Lagurno  also  retain  a  number  of  other

useful thrallslarge, powerful monsters such as ogres, trolls,

minotaurs, or even giants that serve as the citys elite defend-

ers. The sudden appearance of disparate groups of monsters

cooperating together could be a clue to the presence of mind

 ayers in an area.

The thrall barracks are much cleaner and more comfort-

able than the capture pit. Thralls who have been broken to

mind  ayer rule are assets, and its not ef cient to treat them

so badly that they cant work at full strength. Small, doorless

sleeping-cells  and  silent  dormitories  comprise  most  of  the

thrall barracks, which remain quiet and orderly despite the

number of potentially hostile creatures forced to live in such

close quarters.

Hidden Lagurnos thrall barracks are home to about one

hundred and  fty thralls of various races, including a hundred

humanoids (mostly duergar, grimlocks, orcs, and a few luckless

humans) and forty giants (mostly ogres, trolls, and a few ettins

and hill giants). Minotaurs and rarer monsters make up the

rest of the thralls here.

To be fully effective, new thralls need to adjust physically

to their enslavement. Thralls might be assigned tasks by the

mind  ayers that they had no previous training foras miners,

valets, cooks, or warriors. Some are instructed in the  ne points

of acting as a mind  ayers personal servant. Others learn to

handle a stone drill and mallet, practice  ghting with dulled

weapons, or are simply taught to receive punishment without

crying out.

Illithids place very little value on the life of any individual

thrall, but they abhor wastefulness. A thrall that kills itself

and possibly others by causing a tunnel under construction to

collapse has wasted not only its own life (a demonstrably useful

commodity) but also the lives of other trained thralls and the

time  needed  to  redo  the  work.  Consequently,  the  barracks

include large classrooms and training pits, where new thralls

train for the work they are destined to perform as slaves. In

some cases, thralls are brought back for retraining if they prove

unsuitable for their assigned work because of advancing age,

physical in rmity, injury, or a rebellious temperament (though

thralls in this last category more often than not end up on the

menu).  The  mind   ayers  have  developed  a  highly  effective

program of rewards and punishments to spur training. By the

time a thrall completes its indoctrination, it is docile, ready to

work, and eager to please. Older thralls carry out most of the

instruction, under the supervision of  ve mind  ayers.

Bazaar

When goods are brought in from outside, they are sold in

the bazaar. Here mind  ayers purchase  ne cloth or tailored

clothing, meat and other food besides brains, psionic or (rarely)

magic items, books, furniture, and all the other necessities of

daily life and study as a mind  ayer.

This area is instantly recognizable as a market. Tables bearing

goods of every variety line the chamber in orderly rows. Mer-

chants with wares to sell haggle soundlessly with customers

over goods and services. The merchants are duergar thralls

who purchase goods from outside vendors in Upper Lagurno.

Merchants of other races are not brought into Hidden Lagurno,

except as thralls.

Despite their alien nature, mind  ayers carry on the business

of buying and selling in a familiar way. The chief difference is

that mind  ayer communities operate without money. Their

economy is based on a complex system of barter for services,

favors, or training. Cheating and fraud are impossible because

the elder brain makes note of every transaction and enforces

the system. Its not uncommon for a mind  ayer to owe dozens

of debts and be owed just as many in return, with no doubt

that all will be paid.

Although they have no need for money, some illithids do

accumulate gold, silver, and other forms of treasure for its

beauty,  for  its  usefulness  in  procuring  objects  from  other

races, or because of an innate desire to hoard. This acquisi-

tive behavior is not considered aberrant unless it becomes

obsessive.

Performance Eating Arena

This chamber forms a stadium. A stage occupies the lowest,

central spot, with stone benches arranged in a semicircle above

it. The stage features a wooden stock shaped like a small table

with a hole in the center. The tabletop is hinged so that it can

be opened like horizontal stocks and then clamped around a

persons neck, with the trapped person facing the audience.

Illithids need one brain per month to meet their minimum

physiological  needs  for  survival.  Many  eat  more  than  that,

depending on their status within the community and their

personal success at hunting. Even the most compulsive brain

gourmand is restrained by the need to protect the communitys

whereabouts and by the elder brains commanding presence.

The  fact  that  mind   ayers  can  exercise  control  in  their

appetites does not lessen their hunger for more brains. They

have arrived at a peculiar solution to this problem: performance

eating.

Illithid performance eaters train to extract every possible

nuance from the eating experience. They give careful con-

sideration to how the victim is fed and treated prior to the

performance, how it is restrained during the performance,

and the physical process of extracting and consuming the

brain.  This  exquisite  culinary  event  is  shared  with  the

audience through telepathic means, so that every illithid in

attendance experiences the meal as if it were the one eating

the brain.

Adventurers captured by illithids often suffer this fate. Their

unusually active, exploit- lled minds are widely acknowledged

as the most delightful to illithid senses. Further, free minds

that  have  never  been  enthralled  are  considered  superior  to

those of slaves. Through performance eating, every mind  ayer

in the community can experience the thrill of eating such a

 ne brain.

Much of the time, this auditorium is empty. Eating perfor-

mances occur several times a week, but most are small events

with  only  a  dozen  or  so  mind   ayers  in  attendance.  Large,

multimeal special events that draw most of the community

occur perhaps once every two weeks.

The  hall  also  hosts  other  activities  including  lectures,

demonstrations, debates, and even theatrical performances.

Sometimes thralls are forced to perform classical plays.

Laboratories and Workshops

These rooms could be the well-stocked labs of any college of

wizards or alchemists. They are  lled with books and scrolls,

bubbling beakers, complex mechanical apparatuses in varying

stages of completion, and cadavers and body parts that appear

to be the objects of study.

Mind  ayers are curious; it is one of their few admirable qual-

ities. When they turn their powerful intellects to a problem,

they investigate all potential channels for solving itpsionic,

magical, and scienti c. Illithids can be found working on any

number of devices in their labs, some of which would horrify

any  nonillithid  investigator.  On  a  typical  day,  ten  illithids

occupy the labs, along with  fteen thrall servants and another

ten to twenty thralls being used as test subjects.

Nutrient Vats

Dozens of stone vats, each the size of a large laundry tub, dot

the  oor of this chamber. Occasionally, a bubble rises slowly

to  the  surface  of  one  of  these  steaming  pots,  struggling  to

burst through the skin that forms atop the  uid and befoul

the air. The  oors and walls are streaked with dark stains. A

dozen thralls wearing masks stir the fetid tanks or add matter

to the stew.

Mind   ayers  derive  vital  psychic  and  physiological  sus-

tenance from consuming brains, but their bodies also need

larger quantities of normal nutrition to survive. Some of this

comes in the form of meat no different from what a human or

dwarf would eat. Most of it is ingested in the form of a nutri-

ent soup fermented in these vats. Proteins in many forms are

added to the tanks, then siphoned off for consumption when

ripe. Mind  ayers derive pleasure only from eating brains.

All other consumption serves to keep the body functioning

and healthy but it is not a source of enjoyment.

If a character dares to eat illithid stew, he must make a DC

14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 10 minutes.

Temple of Ilsensine

The far end of this long, gently curving hall features an idol of

a massive, disembodied,  oating brain trailing long ganglia.

The stone tendrils twine across the  oor in confused knots

before separating at regular intervals into rising columns that

seem to writhe toward the ceiling. Braziers of incense  ll the

air with a scent of spices so cloying it overwhelms the lungs

and stings the eyes.

This carved image of Ilsensine is believed by mind  ayers

to be a very good likeness and approximately life-size. Since

illithids dont truly worship the deity, they wander in only as

the mood strikes them to make sacri ces or request boons.

Chambers  attached  to  the  central  temple  house  the   ve

clerics and seven acolytes that serve the god. These clerical

mind   ayers  seldom  leave  the  temple  sector.  On  rare  occa-

sions, they conduct processions through the central plaza or

to extract their pick of the thralls and captives from the pit for

unknown purposes. Sometimes they move silently through

the  community  on  unknown  errands.  Their  purposes  and

accomplishments  are  not  well  understood  by  other  mind

 ayers, but the elder brain sanctions everything they do, so

their activities are not questioned.

These servants of Ilsensine have no cleric levels at all. Two are

sorcerers; the others are simply normal mind  ayers trained in

the lore of Ilsensine, choosing ranks in Knowledge (religion)

in preference to other  elds of learning.

Birthing Pods

Ceremorphosis is not an easy process. The body suffers  ts

of madness, delirium, terrible convulsions, and worse as the

brain is slowly devoured. When a tadpole is implanted into a

host body, it is brought to this moss-lined chamber to complete

the week-long transformation. At least one mature illithid and

one or two thralls watch over the twitching, convulsing body

to prevent it from injuring itself and to occasionally wash the

 lth from its body when it momentarily stops thrashing.

Mind  ayer births are rare, so most of the time, these

chambers  are  empty.  They  could  be  used  for  more  than

one  ceremorphosing  tadpole  at  one  time,  but  that  seldom

happens.

The Pool of the Elder Brain

The elder brain lives in a pool that dominates the center of the

chamber. The pool is about 10 feet deep and 50 feet in diameter,

surrounded by a wide lip intricately carved with images and

Qualith inscriptions. The liquid in the pool is dark, swirling,

and foul smelling. Countless small shapes (illithid tadpoles)

swim to and fro in the murk. At the bottom of the pool, the

formless mass of the elder brain stirs listlessly, seen more as a

shadow than a discernible shape.

Mind  ayers regard the protection of the elder brain against

direct attack (mainly from githyanki and githzerai, their most

implacable foes) as the most important duty of the sept. Unlike

other chambers in Hidden Lagurno, the pool of the elder brain

is  protected  by  a  large,  sturdy  door  that  is  kept  barred  and

psionically sealed from the inside. Anywhere from three to

 ve mind  ayers are constantly in attendance in this chamber,

minding the pool and ready to respond to any request the elder

brain might make. Normally, only mind  ayers are permitted

to enter, but on rare occasions, the elder brain indicates that

particularly interesting captives should be brought before it

for inspection and questioning.

The room is guarded by carefully renewed dimensional lock

and screen spells, designed to prevent sudden teleportation

assaults or spying on the chamber. The elder brain itself is

far from defenseless, of course. Its terrible spells and psionic

powers can quickly scour its chamber clean of life, if need be.

But it is essentially immobile, unable to leave the con nes

of its pool, and its survival depends on the mind  ayers that

serve it.

THE LAIR OF SARKT

Sarkt is an illithid sorcerer. It was cast out of its community

for  its  heretical  studies  (Sarkt  was,  in  fact,  lucky  to  escape

alive). It didnt take the cunning creature long to pick up a few

thralls and  nd a new place to live, safe from the murderous

intentions of its comrades.

Sarkt  dwells  in  the  subterranean  ruins  of  an  ancient,

abandoned  shrine  to  Blibdoolpoolp,  the  crustacean-headed

deity of the kuo-toas. This shrine lies on the fringe of a region

controlled by the kuo-toas, but since Sarkts arrival, the  sh-

men  avoid  the  area.  A  few  unfortunate  kuo-toas  now  serve

Sarkt as thralls and maintain the illusion that the shrine still

serves Blibdoolpoolp.

1. TUNNELS

Three major passages converge here. A broad but short avenue

off the intersection leads to the tumbled-down edi ce of a once-

82

impressive shrine, while narrow side passages stretch off into the

unknown darkness.

The  shrine  lies  near  the  intersection  of  three  signi cant

passages  and  several  smaller  ones.  Such  intersections  have

great  importance  underground,  since  travel  is  limited  to

passagescutting  cross  country  is  not  possible.  Kuo-toa

hunters,  grimlock  raiders,  duergar,  and  surface  traders  use

these passages. Many of them have no inkling that a mind

 ayer refugee lives in the old shrine.

2. FAADE (EL 4)

At one time, this faade would have been imposing. It combines

classical  architectural  elements,  such  as  columns  and  arches,

with   utings  and  curves  suggestive  of  monstrous  oysters  or

other shell sh. Much of this beautiful stonework is now tumbled

down. Cut stones as tall as a man lie scattered across the broken

 agstones  of  the  former  plaza,  where  pools  of  dripwater  stag-

nate. A  ight of broad, moss-covered stone steps leads up to the

entrance, a set of bronze doors green with age.

Two  green-silver  humanoids  with  slick,  scaly  hides,  webbed

hands and feet, and big, goggling eyes are trapping small crea-

tures in the moss and pools here.

The shrine itself is part natural cavern, part excavation. The

doors  open  easily  enough,  despite  their  size  and  age.  Their

locks and bars have long since decayed into uselessness, but

they can be partially held shut by a large stone dragged into

place  behind  them  (DC  18  Strength  check  to  force  open).

Currently, the doors are not blocked.

The kuo-toa thralls catch lizards or collect moss here. They

attempt to avoid strangers, especially strangers carrying bright

lights, by withdrawing into the temple, closing the door, and

dragging the stone into place.

Kuo-toa (2): hp 11 each; Monster Manual page 163.

The kuo-toas  ght with shortspears and adhesive shields

if attacked, seeking to withdraw into the temple at the  rst

opportunity. If escape is blocked, they  ght to the death.

3. MAIN VESTIBULE (EL 3 TO 9)

The  rst room inside the shrine is a large, dilapidated vestibule.

Its  walls  are  covered  with  chipped,  stained  friezes  portraying

signi cant  events  in  the  mythology  of  Blibdoolpoolp.  A  heavy

curtain hangs across a doorway in the eastern wall, and a door

cracked open a foot or so leads to the south.

Without a working knowledge of Blibdoolpoolps theology,

the meaning behind the carvings is hard to discern. Looking

at them intently for more than a few minutes is unsettling to

sane  characters;  despite  their  poor  condition,  the  carvings

portray Blibdoolpoolps insanity forcefully.

The kuo-toa clerics that formerly maintained this shrine

concealed  a  glyph  of  warding  in  the  carvings.  Anyone  who

actually studies them (makes a Decipher Script, Knowledge,

or Search check, or spends 1 minute or more in close scrutiny)

triggers the glyph. The glyph (DC 28 Search check to  nd, DC

28  Disable  Device  check  to  disable)  is  a  spell  glyph,  which

casts bestow curse (DC 14 Will save) on the reader. The curse

imposes a horrible sense of dislocation and alienation, resulting

in a 4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill

checks.

Language: Common.

Body Thief (Su): As a full-round action, an intellect devourer

can merge its form with a dead or helpless creature, psionically

consuming the brain and reanimating the body. This resembles

a polymorph spell used to assume the victims form.

Psi-Like  Abilities:  At  willcloud  mind,  compression,  detect

psionics, ego whip (2d4 Cha, DC 16), empty mind (+5 on Will

saves),  id  insinuation  (three  targets,  DC  16);  3/daybody

adjustment (2d12 hp), intellect fortress, painful strike. Manifester

level 7th.

Vulnerability to Protection from Evil (Ex): An intellect devourer

is treated as a summoned creature when affected by protection

from evil.

Sarkt has trained these intellect devourers for physical and

psychic combat since they were quite young, and they have

the Weapon Finesse feat instead of the Toughness feat.

The intellect devourers coordinate their attacks, attempting

to confuse as many foes as possible with a pair of id insinuation

attacks. Whichever devourer makes a more effective opening

attack continues to concentrate, keeping its victims confused,

while the other devourer leaps into melee and tears apart any

victims who are not confused.

Despite the fact that the kuo-toas in area 5 can easily hear

any   ght  in  here,  they  do  not  investigate.  Sarkt  gave  them

orders to guard the rotunda, and thralls show little initiative

in interpreting their commands.

4. CLOAKROOM (EL 0 OR 9)

This  small  room  once  served  as  a  cloakroom  for  the  temple;

bronze hooks still hang on the walls, and low stone benches ring

the chamber. Small heaps of rubbish, nestlike mounds of moss

and  debris,  and  the  strong  smell  of  rotting  meat   ll  the  room

now.

This room adjoining the vestibule was originally used by the

clerics of Blibdoolpoolp as a place to discuss matters of business

to the shrine. The two intellect devourers now make their lair

in this room. The kuo-toa thralls bring them food regularly,

so the creatures always keep aware of any comings and goings

through the temple in case theres food involved. They have

become accustomed to the thralls and dont bother them. They

attack any other creatures entering the shrine.

If the PCs did not encounter the intellect devourers in area

3, they meet the creatures here.

Sarkt allows the devourers to keep some of the baubles from

their victims. This amounts to 180 cp, 540 sp, 230 gp, a blue

quartz (10 gp), a moonstone (50 gp), and a rotted fur mantle

with a black pearl sewn into a concealed pocket (500 gp).

5. ROTUNDA (EL 7 TO 8)

This domed chamber seems to have been a shrine to Blibdool-

poolp.  Its  multicolored  mosaic   oor  is  chipped,  stained,  and

blanketed by moss and slime in many places. The lurid painting

that decorated the ceiling is in even worse shape. Its impossible

to discern what it once portrayed through the cracks, moisture

stains, and dripping water. Eight alcoves in the walls each hold

odd-looking statues of green stone in various poses. All seem to be

human nudes, but the arms and heads have been broken off, and

dark round objects set in the place where the heads used to be.

Three old bronze doors lead from this chamber, spaced equally

along the curving wall.

Several  kuo-toa  warriors  wait  here,  armed  with  spears  and

shields.

This  room  was  formerly  a  shrine  to  the  kuo-toa  deity  Blib-

doolpoolp, the heart of the temple complex. The doors appear

heavy and corroded, but they open easily enough; Sarkt has

had its thralls repair them.

A kuo-toa cleric and two average kuo-toas stand guard here.

If the PCs allowed the kuo-toas from area 2 to escape, they are

here as well.

The cleric hangs back for 2 rounds and casts a spell to ready

itself for combat (divine favor or shield of faith) and an attack spell

against an intruder. Then it joins the melee, hoping to catch

a spellcaster in its pincer staff.

Three  rounds  after  a   ght  begins,  the  kuo-toas  receive

reinforcements from area 7: another kuo-toa and a troll.

gills, they can survive inde nitely on land.

Keen Sight (Ex): Kuo-toas can spot moving creatures even if

they are invisible or ethereal.

or a daylight spell) blinds kuo-toas for 1 round. On subsequent

rounds, they are dazzled while operating in bright light.

Pincer  Staff: See  the  kuo-toa  description,  page  164  of  the

Monster Manual.

Slippery (Ex): All kuo-toas secrete an oily  lm that makes

them dif cult to grapple or snare. Webs, magical or otherwise,

dont affect kuo-toas, and they can wriggle free from most other

forms of con nement.

6. STATUARY

Eight niches in the walls around the rotunda contain statues. All

are of human females, but their hands and heads are broken off

and lie smashed on the  oor. Seven of the statues stone heads

have been replaced with the severed heads of various humanoids

several humans, a drow, a duergar, an elf, and a githyanki.

Originally these statues represented the lobster-headed form

of the kuo-toa deity. In every case, the original carving was

broken  off,  leaving  only  an  uneven  neck  stump.  A  cursory

examination of the broken statuary on the  oor reveals that

the missing heads and hands were not remotely humanoid in

forminstead the statues featured lobsterlike claws, feelers,

and mandibles.

As  soon  as  someone  views  the  statues  closely  (within  10

feet), they notice that the back of each humanoid head has a

gaping hole.

These seven heads are from seven victims whose brains

were  especially  pleasing  when  Sarkt  devoured  them.  One

place of honor remains un lled. If Sarkt encounters mul-

tiple brains that outshine those already enshrined, it simply

replaces one of the former trophies. If any characters were

slain  by  Sarkt  in  an  earlier  encounter,  the  PCs   nd  their

comrades heads here.

9. UNUSED STOREROOM

Piles  of  sodden  and  broken  junk  are  jumbled  throughout  the

room.

This room might have served an important function under the

kuo-toa priests. It is now clogged with jumbled paraphernalia,

much of it taken from slain adventurers, drow, duergar, and

kuo-toas. None of it was particularly valuable to begin with.

Years of exposure to moisture and mildew have ruined most of

it. With a few minutes of poking through the junk and a DC 15

Search check, determined salvagers can turn up masterwork

scale mail, a masterwork dagger, and a pouch containing 44

sp and 18 gp.

10. CHOIR

7. THRALLS QUARTERS (EL 6 OR 0)

These  squalid  rooms  appear  to  be  living  quarters,  but  they

contain  little  in  the  way  of  creature  comforts  and  no  personal

possessions at all.

This chamber is irregularly shaped but seems to have been carved

that way purposefully. It is clean and dry, unlike the rest of the

shrine. Randomly spaced around the walls are several holes that

are big enough for a strong man to insert his arm up to the shoul-

der. These tubes extend to an unknown distance.

Sarkt has seven thralls:  ve kuo-toas, a kuo-toa cleric, a troll,

and the elf Oristel. The kuo-toas do most of the menial work

and keep up appearances (such as they are) around the lair, in

an effort to maintain the illusion that this is nothing more

than a dilapidated shrine to Blibdoolpoolp. Oristel the elf is

Sarkts personal servant, accompanying the master wherever

it  goesexcept  into  Sarkts  true  sanctumunless  ordered

to wait elsewhere.

At the moment, the kuo-toa cleric and four of the kuo-toas

are engaged in guarding or foraging in areas 2 or 5. One kuo-

toa and the troll remain in these quarters, awaiting orders. If

they hear  ghting in area 5, they go to join the  ght there.

Otherwise they attack any intruders who enter this room.

Any PCs captured by the mind  ayers domination power

are assigned a pallet in these rooms (presuming theyre not

eaten right away).

Kuo-toa: hp 11; Monster Manual page 163.

Troll: hp 63; Monster Manual page 247.

When this structure was a shrine, this chamber served a vital

purpose. It was shaped to be an acoustic resonator. Sounds in

this room are ampli ed and channeled through much smaller,

harmonic tubes cut through the stone and leading back to the

rotunda. These tubes extend to an unknown distance. Those

sounds  boom  into  the  rotunda,  seeming  to  come  from  the

surrounding rock itself. The intent was not to trick worshipers

into thinking they were hearing the voices of deities but to

make the priests sermons more impressive.

Sarkt maintains the chamber in working order because its

function amuses the mind  ayer. It sometimes addresses its

thralls through this system, haranguing them for hours on

the superiority of the illithid race and their good fortune to

have become thralls.

11. SARKTS TROPHY ROOM

Chests and urns are arranged in clear order around the walls of

this chamber. Several more stand in the middle of the  oor.

8. THE POOL

The  walls  of  this  chamber  are  natural  stone  with  no  paint  or

plaster. They have been scored everywhere with grooves about

the size of  nger marks. The  oor slopes downward very gently

toward the center, where it drops into a circular, bowl-shaped,

stone-lined depression 15 feet in diameter and 5 feet deep at its

center. Moisture condenses onto the cool walls of the chamber,

trickles to the  oor, and collects in the pool.

Every  kuo-toan  shrine  or  temple  includes  a  pool  of  water

that serves both ceremonial and practical purposes. Because

illithids need to keep their skin moist, they bathe regularly.

Keeping the pool clean for Sarkts daily visits is one of the

thralls chief duties.

This room contains items that Sarkt  nds interesting, attrac-

tive, or potentially useful, but that do not have immediate use

or require immediate analysis. The chamber is kept reasonably

well ordered, unlike area 9.

A  jeweled  velvet  mask  worth  340  gp  hangs  on  one  wall,

and a masterwork trident hangs on the opposite wall. A silver

plate worth 400 gp is displayed nearby. The most interesting

and valuable piece (assuming one could  nd a buyer for it) is a

small golden idol of Blibdoolpoolp with aquamarine eyes and

platinum pincers, worth 1,700 gp.

The door connecting this chamber to room 12 is locked with

two locks (DC 25 and 35 Open Lock checks to open). Sarkt

carries the only keys.

86

12. SARKTS LIVING CHAMBER (EL 7)

This dimly lit chamber contains a bed of soft moss, a variety of

attractive  artwork,  a  chair,  a  desk  covered  with  writing  mate-

rial, several objects made of bone and skin best left unidenti ed,

chests of clothing, and all the other trappings of an owner who

appreciates creature comforts. A male elf is listlessly tidying up.

Anyone setting foot in the room is subject to the effect of a

resonance stone (see below). The elf, Oristel, has succeeded on

his save against the stone, and is not affected by it.

Oristel  is  Sarkts  personal  thrall.  As  soon  as  he  notices

anyone  enter  the  room,  he  shrieks  a  warning  and  attacks.

If  Sarkt  wasnt  alerted  to  the  intruders  before,  it  will  be

when the elf screams. (Sarkt wont come to Oristels

assistance, but it certainly begins preparing for an

attack in its hidden sanctum.)

Suspended from the ceiling at the center of the

room is a human skull with what looks like a

lump of amber in its jaws. The lump of amber is

a resonance stone of despair (see Resonance Stone,

above). Anyone approaching within 30 feet of the

stone must make a DC 16 Will save

or be affected. Sarkt is virtually

immune  to  the  stones  effect

due  to  his  spell  resistance

and  high  Will  save,  but

the illithid  nds it very

useful  when  dealing

with kuo-toa thralls.

A water- lled chest holds

Sarkts dampsuit, a specially

constructed,  slick  leather

bodysuit that keeps the mind

 ayers skin moist and mucous

layer  intact  when  it  ventures

away from its sanctuary for

extended  periods.  In  the

same chest is a pair of dark

goggles Sarkt uses to pro-

tect  its  eyes  from  the

glare of light.

Cubbyholes above the desk

contain several scrolls: arcane

eye, charm person, major image, nondetection, reduce

person, summon swarm, and transmute rock to mud.

Languages: Elven, Common, Undercommon.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex): Oristel  deals  an  extra  3d6  points  of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage

also  applies  to  ranged  attacks

against  targets  up  to  30  feet

away.  Creatures  with  con-

cealment, creatures without

discernible anatomies, and

creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits

are all immune to sneak

attacks.  Oristel  can

choose  to  deliver  non-

lethal  damage  with

his  sneak  attack,  but

only when using a weapon

designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Elf Traits: Elves have immunity to magic

sleep effects. An elf who merely passes within

5  feet  of  a  secret  or  concealed  door  is

entitled to a Search check as if he were

actively looking for it.

Evasion (Ex): If Oristel is exposed

to  any  effect  that  normally  allows

him  to  attempt  a  Re ex  save  for

half damage, he takes no damage

with  a  successful  saving

throw.

Trap nding (Ex): Oris-

tel can  nd, disarm, or

bypass traps with a DC

of 20 or higher. He can use

the Search skill to  nd, and

the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of

the spell used to create it). If his

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

he  discovers  how  to  bypass  the  trap  without  triggering  or

disarming it.

Sarkt the illithid sorcerer

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Oristel retains his Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class even when  at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or other-

wise immobile).

Possessions: +2 leather armor, masterwork rapier, masterwork

13. FALSE SANCTUM

This  chamber  is  lined  with  shelves  and  tables.  All  are  loaded

with books, papers, beakers, skulls, and countless containers of

unidenti able exotica, including herbs, animal parts, stones of

odd  shapes  and  colors,  broken  glass,  powders,  ointments,  and

foul-smelling liquids.

The  room  presents  the  perfect  image  of  what  most  people

expect a wizards or sorcerers study to look like.

A DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) check reveals that the material

components are stale, spoiled, have no magical properties,

or are simply not what the labels claim them to be. Most of

the books and scrolls are of little value to a spellcaster, being

tracts on philosophy, history, or magical theory. The few that

do contain practical knowledge are worm-eaten or mildewed

to the point of illegibility.

Sarkt constructed this room to look like its study, in case

the kuo-toas it preys on or the illithids that drove it from its

home ever tracked the fugitive here. It hopes that creatures

unsophisticated in the ways of magic will be fooled into think-

ing that they have found Sarkts sanctum and be satis ed by

destroying it.

Behind a bookcase is a secret door in a section of wall that

has been patched to match the natural stone that lines the rest

of the chamber (DC 25 Search check to  nd). The bookcase

is mounted on hidden casters that allow it to be rolled aside

easily, allowing access to the secret door.

14. SARKTS SANCTUM (EL 10)

This roughly star-shaped chamber contains a table, a stool, odd

writing  implements  such  as  four-tipped  styluses  and  sheets  of

parchment, and many books and scrolls.

This is Sarkts true sanctum, where the mind  ayer stores its

most  precious  magical  tomes,  treasures,  and  devices.  Upon

 rst exploring the shrine, Sarkt discovered this chamber and

was  intrigued  by  the  odd  shape.  Sarkt  does  not  know  why

the kuo-toas excavated this room in the shape of a star, and

neither did any of the kuo-toa clerics it enslaved. The rooms

original purpose is lost to everyone. After moving in, Sarkt

devised the secret door and the false sanctum to divert any

potential attackers.

Sarkt spends most of its time here. Naturally, it seeks to

immediately  slay  any  uninvited  strangers  who  suddenly

drop in. If warned by any outcry from Oristel in the room

above, Sarkt casts mage armor and invisibility and awaits the

intruders.

Sarkt is even less inclined toward melee combat than the

average  mind   ayer.  If  it  begins  the  encounter  invisible,  it

maneuvers into a place from which it can stun as many crea-

tures as possible before unleashing its mind blast. It saves its

last invisibility spell for escape in case the  ght goes badly.

Various  coffers  and  urns  in  this  room  contain  2,200  sp,

1,100 gp, and 45 pp; a gold-inlaid drow skull worth 2,000 gp;

and an ivory and silver snuff box (200 gp) containing dust of

disappearance.

Extract  (Ex):  A  mind   ayer  that  begins  its  turn  with  all

four tentacles attached and that makes a successful grapple

check automatically extracts the opponents brain, instantly

killing that creature. This power is useless against constructs,

elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. It is not instantly fatal

to foes with multiple heads.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mind  ayer must

hit  a  Small,  Medium,  or  Large  creature  with  its  tentacle

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity.  If  it  wins  the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and attaches the tentacle

to the opponents head. If a mind  ayer begins its turn with

at least one tentacle attached, it can try to attach its remain-

ing tentacles with a single grapple check. The opponent can

escape with a single successful grapple check or an Escape

Artist  check,  but  the  mind   ayer  gets  a  +2  circumstance

bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the beginning

of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): This psionic attack is a cone 60 feet long.

Those caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 19 Will save

or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. This ability is the equivalent of

a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At willcharm monster (DC 19), detect thoughts

he sly, spiderlike neogi are strangers wherever they

go. They travel far and wide in shallow-draft ships

that are equally at home on rivers or oceans. Their

caravans cross deserts and mountains and traverse the

dark labyrinth of the underworld. In their graceful but

terrifying ships, they even ply the skies and venture beyond

to visit unimaginably distant worlds.

The appearance of neogi vessels or caravans in a land is

seldom taken as a good event. Neogi are great traders and

merchants, but they are even greater raiders and despoilers.

They trade if they must, but they prefer to  ll their holds

with treasure and slaves by simply taking what they want

and leaving ruin in their wake. With small armies of umber

hulks and mentally enslaved minions, their far-ranging raids

have made neogi the scourge of many worlds and planes.

The neogi are a great mystery to humans and their kind.

No one knows where they come from; their origins lie in

the Material Plane, but on an unknown world. Some sages

speculate that the neogi world doesnt exist anymore, and

that the spiderlike creatures no longer have a true home. That

might account for their endless wandering.

On other levels, the neogi are perfectly easy to understand.

They  are  rapacious  plunderers,  greedy  merchants,  gleeful

murderers, and slave hunters of the worst kind. They view

everything,  including  their  own  lives,  as  something  to  be

owned, and anything that can be owned is worth taking

by any means.

NEOGI

Neogi  are  vicious,  spiderlike  scavengers,  raiders,  and

slavers that sometimes disguise their predatory practices

beneath a guise of mercantile dealings. No commodity

or business is too sordid for the neogi, and any creatures

dealing with the monsters would be wise to take steps

to make sure they were not cheatedor simply decide

that murder and robbery are better business.

Neogi undergo three distinct stages in their lives:

spawn, adult, and great old master. Spawn are small,

hungry hunters, barely sentient. Adults are the most

commonly  encountered  neogivoracious,  cruel,

and brilliant monsters consumed with lust for gold

and power. Great old masters are huge, bloated neogi

approaching the end of their life spans, serving as

living incubators for the next generation of neogi

spawn.

Neogi lairs are laced with pits, chasms, narrow

bridges, and precarious ledges. With their excellent

balance and jumping skills, and their ability to dash

around  enemies,  neogi  can  move  through  these

89

hazardous areas more quickly and safely than most attackers

can.

All neogi speak Common and Undercommon, and a large

number of them also speak Terran.

Neogi Traits: The tactics of these monsters vary according

to the kind of neogi involved. No neogi is particularly brave,

but all of them are ruthless. They all share the following abili-

ties.

Poison (Ex): Neogi poison is exceptionally virulent, consider-

ing that the creature itself is so frail. A neogi delivers its poison

with  each  successful  bite  attack.  The  initial  damage  is  1d4

points of Dexterity damage, and the secondary damage is 1d4

points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based

and includes a +3 racial bonus.

Immunity to Mind-Affecting Spells and Abilities (Ex): Neogi are

immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Skills:  Adult  and  spawn  neogi  use  their  Dexterity  score

instead of their Strength score for Climb and Jump checks.

Neogi have a +8 bonus on Climb checks and can always choose

to take 10 on Climb checks even if rushed or threatened.

This spiderlike monster has a long,  exible neck and an eel-like

head with tiny, needle-sharp teeth. Its body is covered with stiff

hair, dyed in complex designs, and it wears a light leather harness

for  carrying  pouches  and  weapons.  Its  small  black  eyes  glitter

with intelligence.

Adult neogi are the backbone of the community. They spend

most of their time trying to acquire as much wealth and power

as possible.

A neogis eight-legged body is covered with stiff hair, which

makes it look something like a giant wolf spider. Instead of

a spiders head, however, the neogi has a long,  exible neck

that extends upward and backward, then bends toward the

front again in a large S-curve. Atop that sleek neck sits a small,

narrow head, like that of an eel. Its jaws are lined with tiny,

needle-sharp  teeth,  and  small,  black  eyes  are  pushed  well

forward on the face. An occasional individual has a narrow

beard growing from the front edge of its chin. A typical neogi

dyes its naturally tan fur in one of a multitude of different hues

and patterns. Some of these patterns signify family or rank;

others are just for decoration. A neogi wears simple articles of

decorative clothing and a belt or bandoleer with pouches for

carrying its valuables.

Combat

Adult  neogi  are  frail   ghters,  and  they  know  it.  Wherever

possible, they have their umber hulk slaves (see Neogi Society,

below)   ght  for  them  while  they  linger  nearby  looking  for

opportunities to use their enslave ability. Adult neogi try to

make  foes  more  vulnerable  to  enslavement  by  using  their

poison  rst, delivered via a crossbow bolt (see below). These

creatures are nimble and dif cult to corner.

Adult neogi are pro cient with simple weapons.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d4

Dex, secondary damage 1d4 Wis. As a standard action, an adult

neogi can coat a weapon with poison from its fangs. The poison

remains active for 1 minute after application and functions as

it does when delivered by means of a bite.

NEOGI AND UMBER HULKS

Neogi have bred umber hulks as slaves for generations. Neogi

are  rarely  encountered  without  their  powerful  slaves  at  their

side. A single neogi with one umber hulk slave is an EL 8 en-

counter.

Neogi  are  perfectly  content  to  allow  their  umber  hulks  to

do the fighting for them, sniping at their foes from behind the

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

safety of their allies. If possible, a neogi uses its climbing ability

to stay well above any possible danger. If not, the neogi remains

close to its slave, so that anyone attempting to attack the neogi

in melee must enter within range of the umber hulks confusing

gaze and melee attacks.

Neogi  are  willing  to  sacrifice  their  slaves  to  escape  from  a

dangerous situation, and do so at the slightest provocation.

Enslave (Su): Three times a day, a neogi can try to enslave

any one living creature within 30 feet. This ability functions

similarly to a dominate monster spell (caster level 16th; Will

DC  15).  An  enslaved  creature  obeys  the  neogis  telepathic

commands to the letter. The subject can attempt a new DC 15

Will save every 24 hours to break free. Otherwise, the neogis

control is broken only by the death of the neogi or the enslaved

creature, by a remove curse or dispel magic effect, or if the neogi

travels more than 1 mile from the enslaved creature. At any

given time, a neogi can have a number of creatures enslaved by

means of this ability equal to 1 + its Cha modi er (but neogi

also keep additional slaves in the normal, nonmagical manner).

The save DC is Charisma-based.

Neogi do not need to use this ability to control their umber

hulk slaves (see Neogi Society, below).

This small, scuttling horror seems to be

a spider the size of a cat, but it has

an  eellike  head  on  a  long,  sinuous

neck. Its mouth is full of tiny, sharp

fangs.

These  foul  and  dan-

gerous  pests  usually

are  found  only  in

the  vicinity  of  a

great old master.

Sometimes

adult neogi let large numbers of spawn loose on the outskirts

of their community and leave them to fend for themselves.

Unlike the monstrous vermin they seem to be at  rst glance,

neogi spawn are sentient and self-aware. They are quite cun-

ning and cooperate to bring down larger preyor to turn on

their weaker siblings if other prey is not available.

Combat

Neogi spawn hunt each other, but if they notice other prey, they

charge toward it. In combat, they  ood over a single creature,

biting until it succumbs to their poison. These little horrors

then devour the victim.

Neogi employ a peculiarly horrible means of reproducing their

race. When an adult neogi grows old and weak, its fellows turn

on it, injecting it with a special venom that initiates terrible

changes in the old neogis body. This venom causes the subjects

body to swell into a great, bloated sack 10 feet in diameter.

Upon becoming a great old master, a neogis intellect dims to

the verge of nonsentience, and it loses most of its memories,

feats, magical abilities, and skills. In place of its cruelty and

cunning, there is only a ravenous hunger.

When  the  transformation  is  complete,  adult  neogi  lay

their eggs in the great old masters abdomen. Thereafter, the

adult neogi provide the great old master with foodalive but

immobilizedto sustain it and nourish the young that are

devouring their host from the inside out. Eventually, twenty

to forty neogi spawn chew their way out of the dying master.

Most of these are in turn eaten by their voracious newborn

brothers, but a few survive to become the next generation of

adult neogi.

Combat

A  great  old  master  attempts  to  eat  anything  it  encounters,

biting ferociously and spewing forth spawn.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial damage 1d4

Dex, secondary damage 1d4 Wis.

Spit Spawn (Ex): As a standard action, a great old master

can spit out 2d4 neogi spawn, which can attack the moment

they land. The great old master can place the spawn anywhere

within a range of 30 feet, but no two spawn can land more than

10 feet apart.

Also, when a great old master takes damage, it can release

2d4 spawn. This version of the spit spawn ability is usable once

per round as a free action.

NEOGI SOCIETY

Theres  nothing  to  admire  about  neogi  culture.  These  crea-

tures are vicious murderers, plunderers, and slavers that only

occasionally attempt to disguise their bottomless avarice as

mercantile interest. Their rapacity has made them the rivals

of every thinking race in the world. Neogi traders lie, steal,

cheat,  and  deceive  at  every  opportunity,  but  they  have  the

ability to travel in places where humanoids would meet a swift

and terrible death, and they can deal with creatures that would

be absolutely inimical to any human trader. This means that

neogi can get their claws on all sorts of unwholesome goods

and commodities, and greedy humans always hope to pro t

by commerce with the neogi and their clients.

Of all the races that neogi enslave, umber hulks are their

favorites. Every adult neogi possesses at least one umber hulk,

raised from birth to a life of slavery and conditioned to accept

that situation as the natural order. These umber hulk slaves

take  orders  from  any  neogi  without  question  or  thought.

Umber hulk guards keep less compliant slaves (those under

the effect of the neogis enslave ability) under control and also

act as soldiers in neogi armies and slave raids.

In the neogi worldview, ownership is what fuels the universe.

Everything belongs to the neogi as a wholeif not now, then

it did in the past or it will in the future. Even a neogi can be

owned  as  a  slave  by  another  neogi,  and  the  slaves  can  own

property and slaves, and those slaves can own property and

other slaves, and so on.

NEOGI CHARACTERS

Neogi spawn and great old masters are not suitable as charac-

ters. An adult neogi possesses the following racial traits.

 4 Strength, +6 Dexterity, 2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence,

+4 Wisdom, +6 Charisma.

 Small size (+1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack

rolls, +4 bonus on Hide checks, 4 penalty on grapple checks,

lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters).

 A neogis base land speed is 30 feet, with a climb speed of

20 feet.

 Darkvision out to 60 feet.

 Racial Hit Dice: A neogi begins with  ve levels of aberration,

which provide 5d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3, and base

saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +1, and Will +4.

 Racial Skills: A neogis aberration levels give it skill points

equal to 8  (2 + Int modi er, minimum 1). Its class skills are

Appraise,  Balance,  Climb,  Disable  Device,  Intimidate,  Jump,

Search, and Spot. Neogi use their Dexterity modi er instead of

their Strength modi er for Climb and Jump checks, and their

Climb speed gives them a +8 bonus on Climb checks. A neogi can

always take 10 while climbing, even if rushed or threatened.

 Racial Feats: A neogis aberration levels give it two feats.

Neogi gain Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat.

  Weapon  Pro ciency:  Neogi  are  pro cient  with  simple

weapons.

 +3 natural armor bonus.

 Natural Weapons: Bite (1d4 plus poison), 2 claws (1d3).

 Special Attacks (see above): Enslave, poison.

spells and abilities.

 Automatic Languages: Common, Undercommon. Bonus

NEOGI ANATOMY

Neogi  have  been  likened  to  gigantic  wolf  spiders.  With

eight limbs supporting a  attened, barrel-shaped abdomen,

the  similarity  is  undeniable.  It  is  also  misleading,  because

neogi  are  not  arachnids.  They  are  warm-blooded  creatures

similar to mammals, but with a unique, asexual method for

reproduction.

A neogis eight limbs have two joints in addition to the shoulder

joint. Each knee joint hinges the leg in an opposite direction so

that it can fold up  at against the underside of the body when the

creature is at rest, or when its slung in a special carrying harness

on the back of an umber hulk slave. The front pair of limbs serves

both as legs and arms. These forelegs have no hands, but they do

have clawlike, vestigial thumbs that are surprisingly deft at  ne

manipulation. They are the equal of human hands for most tasks

but dont have as strong a grip as a human.

The body of a neogi departs radically from that of a spider

in the structure of the neck and head. The neck is long and

sinuous. It extends from the front of the body, curves upward

and gracefully back, and then curves forward again in an S

shape. At the end of the neck is a small head suggestive of an

eels head. Two small, dark eyes are positioned so far forward

on the face that they can be mistaken for nostrils. A neogi has

excellent vision forward, but it must turn its neck to see much

to the side. It can easily rotate its neck through 270 degrees

for all-around vision.

Below the eyes is a large mouth so wide that it seems almost

as if the entire bottom portion of the head is hinged to swing

downward. The jaws are lined with hundreds of tiny, needlelike

teeth. A few of these teeth are actually hollow, like a snakes

fangs,  and  serve  the  same  purposethey  deliver  poison

through a bite.

The abdomen of a neogi is covered with coarse, light brown

fur. Neogi are vain about this fur. They dye it in various bright

colors and patterns that have social and fashion signi cance to

other neogi. Beneath the fur, and on the neck and head where

fur does not grow, a neogis skin is smooth, slick, and tight,

ranging from pale off-white to tan to splotchy, charcoal black.

Neogi sometimes apply dyes to their skin, too. A well-appointed

neogi can appear as a blaze of yellow, red, blue, purple, mauve,

and other colors in swirling and banded patterns.

Neogi fur is not heavy enough to provide much warmth in

cold weather, and they are quite sensitive to temperature. They

prefer temperate climates: not too hot and certainly not too

cold. The ships in which they travel from realm to realm rely

on magic to protect against extremes of climate. Where they

build outposts, they search for a surface location that offers

a good combination of climate and security. If one cant be

found, they build below ground, where they can more easily

manage both of those factors through engineering.

Neogi  do  wear  clothing  of  sorts,  but  in  everyday  use,  its

function is entirely decorative. Their dress consists of what

could be considered (for lack of better labels) aprons, scarves,

and shawls. Like the neogi themselves, these tend to be dyed

in bright primary colors or muted but unusual colors. Intricate

stitching, fringe, tassels, beadwork, and quilting are common.

A typical article of neogi clothing would be little more than

a kerchief to a human-sized creature, so they can well afford

the best.

In extreme cases, they don heavy furs and cloaks to protect

themselves against the cold, but they always have problems

protecting their legs. These limbs are so thin that they lose

heat rapidly even when insulated with furs. If a neogi is forced

to venture outside in frigid conditions, it is likely to keep the

trip short and to bundle itself up with its legs folded inside an

insulated bag that can be strapped to an umber hulks back.

REPRODUCTION AND

DEVELOPMENT

Neogi  spawn  grow  to  adulthood  in  about  a  year.  They  can

expect to live 60 to 80 years as adults before their minds begin

to lose their grip on reality. At that point, a neogi becomes a

danger to itself and others because it cannot maintain control

over its slaves. When this happens, one of two fates awaits a

neogi. Most commonly, it is set upon suddenly by other neogi

and devoured on the spot.

In some cases, other neogi attack and poison the victim. A

massive dose of neogi poison causes the victims body to swell

to over ten times its original volume. Within days, the victim

becomes a bloated, insane, nearly helpless blob of tissuea

great old master, in the hypocritical terminology of the neogi.

Other neogi then deposit eggs into the immobilized creature.

After a short period of incubation, the eggs hatch. The spawn

devour the great old master and scatter into the dark corners

of the neogi community, where they live by scavenging and

preying upon one another until some few reach adulthood.

NEOGI VARIANTS

Neogi do not possess any specialized subraces or variants that

live apart from the rest of the race. However, rare neogi are

born with a mutation that results in an adult of smaller size

but greater magical power than others of their kind. These

are known as dwarf neogi. Neogi de lers, slavemasters, and

sorcerers represent typical neogi variations.

Dwarf Neogi

A dwarf neogi is the most extreme of the regularly appearing

birth mutations. It is indistinguishable from other neogi spawn

at  birth,  but  the  difference  becomes  apparent  before  long.

While other spawn gain size and strength quickly, a dwarf

neogi grows very slowly, if at all. By the time it is full grown,

it still stands no more than 2 feet tall and weighs 10 pounds

or fewer, due to its spindliness.

The creatures diminutive size is no indication of its power. A

dwarf neogi is among the most dangerous of all its kind. What

it lacks in physical size, it makes up for in enhanced mental

powers. A dwarf neogi can crush the spirit and sap the will of

most creatures from a safe distance. It always strikes from the

shadows or while safely ensconced behind a protective wall of

umber hulks.

A dwarf neogi is a prized possession among neogi. Few of

them  live  as  free  creatures;  they  are  usually  slaves  of  other

neogi. In some cases, dwarf neogi have been mistaken for an

unknown kind of homunculus familiar.

Dwarf neogi are also widely considered to be the worst

of a bad lot. They are, as a rule, crueler, more ruthless, and

more evil than the average neogi. Perhaps because they have

more tools at their disposal for capturing slaves, dwarf neogi

are known to sometimes murder captives outright, without

even preserving them for foodsomething no other neogi

would do.

Dwarf neogi are quite rare. Fewer than one in a hundred

neogi is a dwarf.

SPIT POISON

A creature with this feat can spit its poison as a ranged touch

attack.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +3, Ability Focus (poison),

Dex 17, poison special attack delivered by bite.

Benefit: As a standard action, the creature can spit its poison

at  a  single  target  within  30  feet.  The  creature  must  succeed

on a ranged touch attack to hit with its poison. The poison af-

fects a hit target just as if the creature had succeeded on a bite

attack. The poison is somewhat weakened when spit out, and

the poisons save DC is reduced by 2.

A neogi de ler

stalks its next victims

Neogi Defiler

Certain  neogi  develop  a  more  virulent

poison  and  learn  to  spit  this  poison  as  a

ranged  attack.  These  neogi  gain  levels  as

rogues and are called neogi de lers. Visually, noth-

ing  distinguishes  these  neogi  from  their  ordinary

kin. Within neogi society, de lers are valued for their

capability, but they are not held in the high regard that

is reserved for sorcerers and slavemasters. In fact, they are

rather mistrusted. Along with their more potent poison and

spitting  ability,  they  have  strong  chaotic  tendencies.  This

unpredictability makes de lers seem unbalanced to other

neogi and frightens them.

The  sample  neogi  de ler  shown  below  has  applied  the

Ability Focus feat to its poison, which increases its poison

save DC from 14 (normal for a neogi with its Constitution

score) to 16.

Enslave (Su): Three times a day, a neogi de ler can try to

enslave  any  one  living  creature  within  30  feet.  This  ability

functions  similarly  to  a  dominate  monster  spell  (caster  level

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 16 (14 when spit), initial

damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 1d4 Wis.

Sneak Attack (Ex): A neogi de ler deals an extra 1d6 points of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus  for  any  reason.  This  damage  also  applies  to  ranged

attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with

concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and creatures immune to extra damage from critical

hits are all immune to sneak attacks. The de ler can

choose to deliver nonlethal damage with its sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed

for that purpose, such as a sap

(blackjack).

Trap nding (Ex): A neogi de ler can  nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. It can use the Search skill to

 nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC

25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If its Disable Device

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, the de ler discovers

how to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Possessions: bracers of armor +2, +1 light crossbow with 20 bolts,

potion of cure moderate wounds.

Neogi Slavemaster

Like a de ler, a neogi slavemaster has learned to enhance its

natural  abilities.  Neogi  slavemasters  enjoy  a  greater  ability

to enslave others. Slave raiding parties include a slavemaster

whenever possible. With its increased ability to dominate, a

slavemaster can capture more slaves and pass off their control

to other neogi after the raid.

Most slavemasters own other neogi as slaves, in addition

to the usual umber hulks and servant races. Because of their

wealth, slavemasters rise to positions of dominance in neogi

society.

Neogi slavemasters are adult neogi that have the Ability

Focus (enslave) feat. Their Charisma scores are also higher

than average for neogi, which further increases the save DC

for their enslave ability and allows them to control more

slaves.

Enslave (Su): Five times per day, a neogi slavemaster can try

to enslave any one living creature within 60 feet (caster level

16th;  Will  DC  17).  An  enslaved  creature  obeys  the  neogis

telepathic commands to the letter. The subject can attempt

a new Will save every 24 hours to break free. Otherwise, the

neogis  control  is  broken  only  by  the  death  of  the  neogi  or

the enslaved creature, by a remove curse or dispel magic effect,

or if the neogi slavemaster travels more than 10 miles from

the enslaved creature. At any given time, a neogi can have a

number of creatures enslaved by means of this ability equal to 3

+ its Cha modi er (but neogi also keep additional slaves in the

normal, nonmagical manner). The save DC is Charisma-based

and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Challenge Rating: 4.

Neogi Sorcerer

While wealth is the ultimate arbiter of power in neogi society,

magical  aptitude  can  make  the  acquisition  and  defense  of

wealth signi cantly easier. The wealthiest neogi demonstrate

a surprising af nity for magic.

Neogi  sorcerers  are  accorded  great  respect  within  their

communities. Sorcerers are unique within neogi society in

that they alone cannot be slaves of other neogi, other than the

leader of a tribe. Should a neogi sorcerer become indebted to

another neogi, the leader is obligated to buy off the sorcerers

debt.

Neogi with skill at sorcery do not advertise this to members

of other races, and reserve their special talents as a surprise for

unsuspecting enemies. Weasels are the most common familiars

of neogi sorcerers, with snakes a close second.

NEOGI LIFE

The glue that binds neogi society

together is commercial tradeat

least,  thats  what  the  neogi  call

it.  In  fact,  their  trade  is  a

three-cornered  platform

supported by traditional

mercantilism,  slavery

(buying, selling, raid-

ing,  and  owning),

and  out-and-out

piracy.

All  neogi,  re-

gardless of their

class  or  their

interests, are trad-

ers at their core. They

have carved a niche for

themselves  over  eons

as middlemen who ac-

quire goods cheaply where theyre plentiful, transport them

to where theyre rare, and then sell them at high prices. The

neogi see themselves as the ultimate merchants. The fact

that they sometimes steal the goods rather than buy them,

or that the goods themselves are sometimes sentient beings

who would rather not be bought and sold, is of no concern

to the neogi. To call them amoral would be too generous.

They are unprincipled, unethical, ruthless marauders that

care nothing for the lives or property of anyone but them-

selves.  The  fact  that  they  are  tolerated  or  even  welcomed

(cautiously) rather than attacked when they arrive at a mar-

ket or port is a testament to greed everywhere.

Neogi trade in anything that offers the potential for pro t,

whether it is furniture, food, wine, art, magical items, exotic

animals, or rare manuscripts. Without question, the merchan-

dise that earned them their infamous reputation is slaves.

An adult neogi

LEADERS AND SLAVERY

Leadership within the neogi community is rigidly structured.

Because they have no means of tracing parentage, it cannot be

hereditary. Neogi have no mechanism for dynastic inheritance

of rulership or property. All neogi spawn within a tribe spring

from the same source. One might suppose that this would lead

to widespread feelings of equality within the community, but

that assumption would be wrong.

The heavily strati ed nature of neogi society is built around

ownership of slaves. Although neogi are essentially tribal, the

question of leadership is more complex than it appears.

In its simplest iteration, the tribe member that owns the most

slaves is the leader, also called the administrarch. Neogi-style

slavery is a question of degrees. The neogi recognize four tiers

of slaves.

The First Tier

Lowest  on  the  scale  are

slaves  the  neogi  consider

little  more  than  livestock.

They have been captured and

penned up but not enslaved by

the neogis mental power. These

unfortunate  creatures  are  fed

just enough to keep them alive

but weak. They serve three

purposes: as meat on the

hoof,  as  merchandise

to  be  sold,  and  as  a

resource pool from

which  to   ll  the

ranks of the second

tier.

These  slaves,

with  very  few  ex-

ceptions, are communal propertyno

one  neogi  owns  thembecause  ac-

quiring  them  probably  involved  a

communal  effort  in  the  form  of  an  or-

ganized raid. Arranging for the (minimal)

care of these slaves and managing their use is one of the ad-

ministrarchs chief responsibilities.

The neogi keep adding to their pool of captives as long as

they have somewhere to con ne them and enough umber hulk

minions to keep them from escaping.

The Second Tier

The second tier of slavery consists of creatures that have been

actively enslaved from the pool of captives or captured and

enslaved directly by a neogi acting on its own behalf.

In  keeping  with  their  high  level  of  paranoia,  neogi  fear

their slaves more than almost anything else. This is because a

neogis mind-controlling enslavement can be fought. A slave

can break free of those mental bonds, and when it does, its

likely to be murderously angry. For this reason, neogi dont

97

like to have more than three creatures under their personal

enslavement at any given time, even if their Charisma scores

would allow them to keep more. With more than that, they

run an ever-greater risk of losing control over one or several

and being murdered in their homes.

The Third Tier

The third tier of slavery is the cadre of umber hulks that serve

the neogi. These are born and bred to slavery, and through

lifelong  conditioning,  they  accept  their  position  as  part  of

the  natural  order.  Each  neogi,  upon  reaching  adulthood,  is

presented with an umber hulk slave by the administrarch. An

additional umber hulk might be awarded in recognition of a

great deed or great service to the tribe. In this way, individual

neogi can accumulate two, three, four, or even more umber

hulk slaves. Having more than two is considered a signi cant

honor.

The Fourth Tier

The fourth tier of slave ownership is, of course, owning other

neogi. This state comes about most commonly through non-

payment of debts. Neogi take debts very seriously. They loan

money  freely  but at high rates of interest. Missing a  single

repayment is suf cient cause to become enslaved, and so is

damaging  someones  property  to  an  extent  that  exceeds  a

neogis ability to pay. A neogi owing more than it can pay for

any reason, in fact, leads to its enslavement. Gambling debts are

the leading culprits here; neogi are compulsive gamblers.

Neogi-to-neogi slavery functions differently from the other

tiers. They do not use their mental enslavement power on one

another; the rigidity of their society is enough to force compli-

ance. This type of slavery has as much kinship with feudalism

as with a more traditional de nition of slavery. A neogi slave

is more than property, but less than subject.

More important, a neogi that becomes a slave does not lose

its  own  slaves.  Those  slaves  still  belong  to  it,  but  they  also

belong to the neogis owner. If that neogi is, in turn, owned

by another, then all of its slaves are tallied as possessions of

the third neogi. In this way, neogi can amass large numbers

of  slaves  without  overtaxing  their  ability  to  keep  them  all

enslaved.

The most unusual situation occurs in what the neogi term

the great wheel of ownership. Consider a situation in which

neogi A belongs to neogi B, B belongs to C, and C belongs to D.

It is conceivable that through the vagaries of misfortune, neogi

D could become the property of neogi A, creating a circular

ring of ownership with no neogi at its head as the undisputed

owner. In this case, all neogi involved become the property of

the administrarch, retaining individual control over only their

personally held slaves and umber hulks. The neogi seek to avoid

this situation because it strips them of hard-won wealth.

Another  important  question  of  ownership  arises  when  a

neogi dies or becomes a great old master. What becomes of its

slaves? Its personal, second-tier slaves are returned to the  rst-

tier pool. This needs to be done quickly, because their mental

enslavement ends at the moment the neogi dies or becomes

a master. Many dont live long enough to be returned to the

slave quarters; they react to their freedom by trying to escape.

Umber hulks, never the most thoughtful or gentle of guardians,

respond by killing the would-be escapees. A dead neogis umber

hulk  servants  can  be  reassigned  to  another  neogi.  Barring

that, they become the property of the administrarch, at least

temporarily.

Neogi that were owned by the recently deceased become

free. Their obligation is complete. This has a remarkable effect

on  leadership  within  the  neogi  tribe.  The  administrarch

is,  by  de nition,  the  largest  single  slaveholder  in  the  tribe.

Leadership  can  change  as  the  balance  of  slave  ownership

changes. This is rare because of the way wealth begets more

wealth. Its not uncommon for the largest slave ownerthe

administrarchto own the second-largest slave owner as one

of its slaves. On the passing of the administrarch, one of its

slaves becomes the new administrarch in a smooth transition

of power. Being the slave of another neogi does not make a

neogi unworthy, though it does reduce the creatures status.

LANGUAGE

Neogi  long  ago  abandoned  or  forgot  their  own  language,

adopting  instead  the  languages  of  their  customers.  Neogi

speak Common, even among themselves. Since they make use

of subterranean lairs and bases and deal with creatures such

as mind  ayers and other deep-dwelling monsters, they also

master Undercommon early on. Many also speak Terran.

RELIGION

With religion, as with most things, neogi are opportunists. No

matter what god they consider their primary deity, they at least

pay lip service to others, if only to cover all bets. Consequently,

neogi are indifferent to speci c deities, professing worship in

whichever power strikes them as most convenient at the time.

They have even been known to profess veneration for human

deities, such as Fharlanghn or St. Cuthbert, but this is almost

always a negotiating ploy of some kind.

When not seeking advantage from some power or another,

the most commonly worshiped god among neogi is Tharizdun.

In the darkness and entropy of Tharizdun, the neogi see a sort

of divine rapacity that merits their respect. Although Thariz-

dun rarely rewards his worshipers with spells or divine favor,

neogi that follow him believe that taking wealth and property

from others and hoarding it for themselves is a metaphor for

consuming the world around them.

Less philosophical neogi sometimes venerate the terrible

being  known  as  the  Patient  One.  Neogi  of  this  stripe  tend

to  be  physically  gluttonous  creatures  that  relish  the  act  of

devouring  intelligent  victims.  Destroying  a  being  for  ones

personal sustenance is the most complete form of dominion

one creature can exert over another. Neogi followers of the

Patient  One  ritually  devour  their  less-useful  slaves  as  an

expression of religious fervor.

The cult of Vecna has a small but slowly growing follow-

ing among neogi. The Maimed Lord appeals strongly to all

the worst traits in neogi psychology: their penchant for evil,

secrecy,  the  exploitation  of  weakness,  and  the   aunting  of

strength.  Worship  of  Vecna  doesnt  exactly  constitute  an

underground  movement  within  neogi  society,  but  it  is  not

practiced openly. Other neogi disapprove, resisting the notion

of venerating a human deity, no matter how evil. As long as

Vecnas followers conduct their rites in secrecy, they suffer no

undue consequences at the hands of their fellows. Wheres the

pro t in pointless religious debates, after all?

Information about Tharizdun and the Patient One is pre-

sented in Chapter 9: The Aberration Hunter.

RELATIONS WITH OTHER RACES

The only creatures that trust neogi are those that have nothing

to fear from them, and few races  t that description. Undead,

because they are immune to mind control, cannot be enslaved

by neogi. Illithids are not entirely immune, but their mental

power  is  so  much  greater  than  the  neogis  that  they  might

as  well  be.  Besides,  the  illithids  never  allow  themselves  to

be placed in a position where neogi could gain an advantage

over them.

The combination of the neogis predatory tendencies and

their utterly evil outlook prevents most humans, dwarves,

and elves from forming permanent treaties with them. Neogi

caravans and trading vessels sometimes call at human, dwarf,

or  elf  towns,  but  they  are  not  welcome,  and  their  stay  is

short. Its likely that some mutually bene cial trades can be

worked out during a short stay, but theres always a chance

that at least a few townspeople will turn up missing after

the neogi depart.

Races and societies that make use of slaves are more likely

to have dealings with neogi. These far-roving traders have

the advantage of bringing slaves from points so distant that

theres little chance of their kin or countrymen coming to

set them free.

When  faced  with  well-defended,  savvy  customers,  the

neogi can actually be good trading partners. They recognize

value and because of their lawful natures, they honor agree-

ments once theyre  nalized. The only way to be secure when

dealing with neogi is to operate from a position of strength.

Intimations of weakness invite subterfuge and double-deal-

ing, and possibly even trigger an attack. The neogi need to

keep their slave pens  lled somehow, and raiding is the most

direct method.

While slaves and mercantilism are the backbone of neogi

enterprise, they have another area of expertise that is less

recognized  but  sometimes  even  more  valuable:  naviga-

tion. Neogi travel more widely than nearly any other race,

across continents, oceans, entire worlds, and even planes

of  existence.  They  know  where  to  find  almost  anything,

and there are few places they cannot reach, if theyre paid

well  enough.  Taking  passage  on  a  neogi  vessel  or  with  a

neogi  caravan  is  risky  business  for  desperate  customers.

Those tempted, or forced by necessity, to travel this way are

advised to work out an iron-bound contract ahead of time,

to travel in strength, to keep their business secret, and to

sleep with one eye open.

NEOGI MAGIC

Unlike many of the other sentient aberration races, neogi are

not  very  innovative  with  their  magic.  Instead,  they  are  the

ultimate scavengers, freely stealing from any interesting magi-

cal tradition they come across, taking what they  nd useful,

and discarding the rest. A neogi wizard might know spells

originating on a half-dozen different worlds, some of them

created by fearsome beholder mages, others by ancient human

necromancer-liches, and still others by elf enchanters.

The anatomy of the neogi imposes restrictions on which

magic items they can use and how the creatures use them. A

neogi can wear:

One headband, hat, helmet, or phylactery on the head.

One pair of lenses or goggles over the eyes.

One amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab

around the neck.

One cape, cloak, or mantle around the shoulders.

Two pairs of bracers or bracelets on its two uppermost pairs

of limbs.

One glove, pair of gloves, or pair of gauntlets on its fore-

claws.

One ring on each claw (total of two rings).

Neogi cannot wear vests, vestments, shirts, robes, belts, boots,

or shoes.

NEOGI GOALS

In the neogis view of the universe, all things are, were, or will

eventually be owned by the neogi. At that point, they will ful ll

their racial destiny and the universe will achieve its perfect

formin effect, the living world will transform into the neogi

image of paradise. A key factor in this view is that it concerns

not just material things, but all things. All living creatures will

also be owned by neogi, and all other neogi will be owned by

the almighty leader of the race, the administrarch.

In  the  short  term,  neogi  goals  are  simple.  Each  wants  to

become as rich as possible and to own the longest chain of

slaves it can assemble, eventually working its way up to the

position of administrarch.

SLAVES

Even more than trade, slaves are the cornerstone of neogi life.

Without slaves, neogi could not operate their ships, build their

nests, move their goods, or even feed and clothe themselves.

Neogi have lost the will and the knowledge to perform such

tasks because those matters are the work of slaves. A typical

neogi  knows  how  to  do  just  two  things,  and  it  does  them

exceedingly well: strike a hard bargain and manage slaves.

Every adult neogi owns at least one slave. Many neogi own

more than one, but because of the limitations of their enslave

power, few use more than three on a daily basis. Excess slaves

are kept penned up until they are sold, brought out of con ne-

ment as replacements, or relegated to become food.

The most common slaves are umber hulks. An adult neogi

is never seen outside its stronghold without at least one umber

hulk slave in tow. Most of the time, the neogi is carried in a

special sling high on the umber hulks shoulders.

Neogi  breed  their  own  umber  hulk  slaves,  rather  than

capturing  them  or  buying  them.  The  relationship  between

neogi  and  enslaved  umber  hulks  is  almost  symbiotic.  The

umber hulks do not need to be subjected to mental enslave-

ment every day. To an outside observer, they seem to serve

willingly, but this is not really the case. The umber hulks are

conditioned from birth to believe that servitude is the

highest aspiration. They are treated surprisingly

well, far better than other neogi slaves. They dont

serve  the  neogi  for  rewards  or  as  mercenaries.

Because of their conditioning, they genuinely fear

and respect the neogi. Observers have been

amazed to see a neogi physically punishing

an umber hulk with a whip or rod while

the umber hulk, far larger and many

times more powerful than its abuser,

meekly  accepts  the  beating  from

its  acknowledged  master.  Other

slaves have revolted against neogi

overlords,  but  umber  hulks  have

never risen against them.

Free  umber  hulks  have  no

objections  to  this  arrange-

ment.  Fierce  and

barbaric, they have

no  sympathy  for

those  of  their

kind that have

been  domes-

ticated.  Free

umber hulks

sometimes

serve  neogi

as  mercenar-

ies  for  pay.

They  are  safe  from

enslavement  because  the

neogi know that umber hulks born

to freedom make intractable slaves. Like-

wise, the mercenaries know that umber

hulks born to slavery cannot adjust to life as free barbarians,

so they are happy with the status quo.

A neogi merchant inspects

the merchandise

The neogi are like the waterwheel that draws work and energy

(pro t) from the water without interrupting its  ow.

This appears to be a pretty philosophy, but it is typical, self-

serving neogi claptrap. The neogi are predators, not benign

facilitators.  They  buy  merchandise  only  when  the  price  of

purchasing  is  less  than  the  price  of  stealing  or  having  to

 ght for it. No one who deals with the neogi does so casually.

Caution and a large measure of self-protection are absolutely

necessary.

Under the right conditions, trading with the neogi can be

pro table. The right conditions means having the strength

to  protect  whats  yours.  Its  certainly  possible  to  bluff  the

neogi,  because  they  tend  to  be  cautious  in  their  dealings

with unknown quantities. It is, after all, safer to pay a little

more  than  to  get  into  a   ght  you  might  lose.  Its  smart  to

remember, however, that the neogi have

ways of making people do things they

wouldnt normally do, and of making

people  more  agreeable  than  they

might otherwise want to be.

Trading with Neogi

At some point, player characters might be forced

into buying or selling with neogi. They

might  seek  a  particular  magic  item,

a  scroll  containing  an  answer  to  an

ancient  riddle,  or  the  return  of  a

companion who has been

enslaved.

The  best  way  to

handle  such  ne-

is

gotiations

through  role-

playing,  but

it  helps  if

the DM has

a  yardstick

to measure

value. When dealing with

the neogi, the going rate

isnt  always  what  the

book  says  it  isits  what

the  neogi thinks it is, especially where slaves

are concerned. A neogi might know of a dis-

tant market or have plans for a creature that substantially

increases the price at which it will sell. Also, so many of

the  neogis  goods  are  from  alien  or  inaccessible  places

that they simply arent available from anyone else. In that

case, there is no competition and the neogi can set its

price; the only obstacle is finding an interested buyer with

sufficient cash.

When setting values, begin with the values given for the

same or similar items in Chapter 7: Equipment of the Players

Handbook. Neogi seldom deal in shoddy items, and much of

what they carry is of above average to masterwork quality, so

they seldom sell anything for less than its book value and seek

TRADE AND PIRACY

Most people distinguish between trade and piracy, but to the

neogi, it is a semantic nicety and little more. Piracy is simply

one  more  method  for  acquiring  trade  goods  at  the  lowest

possible price.

That attitude is wrapped up in the underlying neogi phi-

losophy that everything did, does, or at some point will belong

to the neogi. Goods are like waterthey  ow from one place

to another, always moving downhill from surplus to de cit.

100

20 to 50 percent more than that. If the item comes from far away

(more than 500 miles) and its not available locally, double its

price. If the item comes from another world or another plane

of existence, the skys the limit ve to ten times the book

price is a good target.

The value of slaves is a different matter. Multiple factors go

into the value of a slave, and the interest shown by the potential

buyer is not the least. The basic method for determining the

value of a slave is based on the creatures CR, using the follow-

ing formula:

Cost = (CR, minimum 1)2  100 gp

An unskilled dwarf, for example, with CR 1/2, costs 100 gp

(CR 1/2 rounds up to 1; 1 squared = 1; 1 times 100 gp = 100 gp).

A troll slave, on the other hand, costs 2,500 gp (CR 5 squared

= 25, times 100 gp = 2,500 gp).

Unusual  or  marketable  qualities  in  a  slave,  such  as  great

strength,  great  beauty,  valuable  skill,  or  exotic  origin,  can

multiply the price by two, three, or four. A skilled miner dwarf

might bring 200 gp if sold at a mine. If that same dwarf were

exceptionally strong, he could cost 400 gp. If that dwarf was an

8th-level rogue and the buyer was the head of a thieves guild,

the slave could cost between 12,800 and 25,600 gp. The DM

has considerable leeway when setting these prices, of course.

When dealing with high-level characters, theres always a pos-

sibility that the neogi dont know how valuable or how skilled

a particular captive is, leading them to undervalue the slave.

Several skills come into play when haggling with neogi.

Appraise is valuable for obvious reasons, but its less useful

when dealing with unfamiliar or alien goods.

Diplomacy is another handy skill. Long years of trading with

some of the most unsavory creatures imaginable have made the

neogi dif cult to offend, but they respond uncharacteristically

well to politeness.

Sense Motive is essential; neogi lie about anything if they

expect to get away with it.

Pertinent Craft and Knowledge skills can provide essential

synergy bonuses to relevant Appraise checks.

TRAVEL

Among the most impressive achievements of the neogi are

their  spider-shaped   ying  ships.  Spiderships  not  only   y

rapidly from point to point on a world, but they are said to be

able to travel from one world to another. When neogi arrive

with exotic goods, the items might not be simply from far

awaythey might be literally from another world.

In practical terms, most neogi are bound to the world where

they live and tied to more mundane methods of travel. Like

most  merchants,  they  favor  caravans  for  protection.  Their

caravans  tend  to  be  small,  but  with  umber  hulks  acting  as

guards, they travel most regions with con dence. In fact, they

probably present a greater danger to those they meet on the

road than vice versa.

WRECK OF THE

MINDSPIDER

A few weeks ago, a neogi  ying ship met with misfortune

in  a  furious  thunderstorm  as  it  was  setting  out  on  a  long

journey.  Heavily  damaged,  it  crashed  on  an  isolated  rocky

beach. Several neogi and their slaves were killed or injured

in the crash, but  ve of the small monsters survived, along

with four umber hulks and a handful of other useful slaves.

Under  the  leadership  of  the  sorcerer  Neex  Hist,  the  neogi

are working to repair their ship so they can continue their

interrupted voyage. In the meantime, they have set up camp

in a large sea cave close by the site of the shipwreck. While

the repairs continue, the neogi and their minions are scouring

the area for anything of interesttheres no point in leaving

potentially valuable merchandise in the vicinity of the crash

site, after all.

The  areas  outside  the  sea  caves  consist  of  sheer  bluffs,

pebble-strewn beaches with heavy surf and massive driftwood

logs,  and  a  thick  coastal  forest  of  evergreens  beginning  at

the upper end of the beach. The coast is cool and rainy, with

frequent fogs.

At the time the PCs arrive on the scene, a light fog covers

the area. This fog has no effect within 30 feet, but creatures

30 to 60 feet away have concealment, and vision is obscured

beyond 60 feet.

The beach is dif cult terrain due to the deep layer of pebbles.

The outer sides of the headland are steep, but offer numerous

handholds (DC 15 Climb check).

Inside, the sea caves are somewhat slick and wet. Add +5 to

the DC of Balance or Climb checks made inside the caves.

In  several  places,  the  neogi  had  the  umber  hulks  block

passages with heavy boulders. Rolling a boulder barrier aside

requires a DC 22 Strength check. Two or three umber hulks

cooperate to emplace or remove a barrier.

1. GUARD POST (EL 8)

A  tall  headland  rises  up  across  the  beach  in  a  long  rocky  wall

jutting well out into the water. Mist-wreathed evergreen forest

crowns  the  top  of  the  cape,  and  surging  waves  break  along  its

sides. A large crevice in its side leads to a cave at the beach level.

Two  armored  bugbears  stand  outside  the  cave,  keeping  watch

over the area.

If  the  PCs  approach  openly  and  give  no  outward  signs  of

hostility, continue with the following:

The bugbears glare at you, sizing you up. Are you here to trade?

one growls.

The bugbears have orders to defend the lair against outright

attack, but to hold their  re until theyve established whether

any approaching creatures might in fact be potential custom-

ers. A party of characters can easily feign interest in trading,

but  before  the  bugbears  allow  any  strangers  to  enter,  they

summon the umber hulk Kothogg, who keeps out of sight in

the alcove just within the entrance. Kothogg is really in charge

of the guardpost, and it decides whether strangers seem like

theyre here to trade or cause trouble. Kothogg doesnt speak

or  understand  Common.  If  the  bugbears  give  visitors  the

thumbs-up, the umber hulk leads them to area 2 to meet the

neogi Rixxil Kas. Kothogg wont lead PCs holding weapons

anywhere, though.

If the PCs simply attack the bugbears, Kothogg comes to

their assistance. It retreats if reduced to 20 or fewer hit points,

hoping to warn its masters of an attack.

If the PCs attack the base and then leave, the neogi have the

umber hulks block this entrance tunnel with huge boulders

to prevent any further incursions from this direction.

If  Kothogg  leads  the  PCs  into  the  chamber,  Rixxil  Kas

assumes they have come to trade. The neogi are interested in

small, high-value cargo such as magic items, gemstones, rare

spices, exotic slaves, and such things; the ship isnt that big,

after all. Of course, Kas is not above negotiating a trade and

then  arranging  an  ambush  to  enslave  its  would-be  trading

partners.

If the PCs enter without Kothogg, Kas assumes trouble, and

orders its slaves to attack.

If things go poorly, Rixxil Kas orders the giant octopus in

area 3 to come and assist. The neogi has enslaved the octopus

and can command the creature as it likes. The octopus can

remain in the water and still reach much of the cave with its

tentacles.

The orcs and goblins  ee if at all possible, hoping that this

is their chance for an escape.

Much of the cargo in this cave consists of supplies for a long

voyagesalted meats, pickled  sh, hardtack, and so on. The

valuables include  fty bottles of  ne wine, thirty- ve bolts of

silk worth 50 gp each, one hundred furs (mostly beaver) worth

5 gp each, and various other trade goods. Rixxil Kass cloak

clasp is a  ne gold chain worth 240 gp.

Kas also has two coffers in area 7, where it keeps more cash

and easily traded goods in case a deal presents itself.

The bugbears are not dominated by the neogi; theyre simply

held by fear of their small masters (or, more accurately, fear of

the foul-tempered umber hulks that serve their small masters).

Given  the  chance  to  escape,  they  are  more  than  willing  to

abandon the neogi to their fate.

3. WATER PASSAGE (EL 8)

The mouth of the sea cave faces the open ocean. Waves surge

into the cave from outside, roaring and rumbling in the con ned

space.

2. SEA CAVE (EL 8)

The loud rushing of water and the cries of sea birds  ll this cave,

open  on  its  western  end  to  the  sea.  Small  waves  surge  onto

the gravel beach inside. Daylight peeks into the cave from the

half- ooded  western  entrance,  the  tunnel  to  the  north,  and  a

large crevice facing west. A steep, dimly lit passage climbs east,

deeper  into  the  headland.  Heaps  of  crates,  heavy  casks,  bales

of cloth, and other such goods litter the higher and drier parts

of the cave.

A spiderlike creature the size of a large dog scuttles over the

crates, inspecting them. It has a long, snaky neck and wears a

strange sort of cape or cloak over its carapace, fastened with a

golden chain. Several humanoidsorcs and goblins, mostly

work to rearrange the goods, and a big umber hulk towers behind

the little spider-creature.

The  neogi  Rixxil  Kas  serves  as  the  companys  stores  and

cargomaster. The mindspiders cargo was of oaded into this

cave, and Kas maintains exacting records of which supplies

are being used for which purposes.

The water in here is swift, cold, and treacherous (DC 18 Swim

check to navigate). The drop-off is steep; anything within 5

feet of the shore is 5 feet deep, and the rest of the passage has

an average depth of 10 to 15 feet.

The neogi have an unusual guard for this entrance: a giant

octopus enslaved by Rixxil Kas. The neogi has ordered the

creature to remain near and slay anything coming in or going

out. Normally, the monster lurks out near the mouth of the

cave,  where  the  water  is  deeper  and  food  is  more  likely  to

wander by.

Giant Octopus: hp 52; Monster Manual page 276.

4. REPAIR YARD (EL 9)

The passage from the sea cave opens up on a hidden cove, sur-

rounded  by  high  headlands  and  dense  forest.  A  broad,  rocky

strand  runs  for  several  hundred  yards  to  the  next  headland.

Nearby, a large, strange-looking vessel lies canted on its side,

well above the storm line. It resembles a fantastic spider made

of dark, polished wood and enameled metal, with masts in the

shape  of  long  arachnid  legs,  windows  for  its  dark  small  eyes,

and  a  large  open  hatch  in  its  belly,  leading  to  a  cargo  hold.

The spider-ship seems to have been damaged; part of the hull

is smashed.

Surrounding the spider-ship is a makeshift repair yard. Several

large  tents  house  woodworking  shops,  and  a  number  of  trees

have been felled and are being shaped into planks in an impro-

vised sawmill. Humanoids are busy hoisting new planks over the

ships damaged areas and hammering them into place under the

supervision of another strange, spiderlike creature.

The neogi Azri Voqq, helmsman and shipwright, is overseeing

the repair of the mindspider. It possesses more expertise in

ship construction than its fellows, and has been given absolute

priority in the use of talented slaves. To ensure Voqqs attention

to its task, the dwarf neogi Urqo Zarpersonal slave to Neex

Hist, the neogi leadershadows its every step, scrutinizing

Voqqs work for even the minutest  aw. The shipwright would

dearly love for some horrible construction accident to befall

the  annoying  Zar,  but  so  far  no  such  opportunities  have

presented themselves.

The  neogi  regard  their  mindspider  as  sacrosanct,  and

are distinctly uncomfortable with allowing the ship to be

seen by outsiders. Any PCs who appear here without being

escorted by an umber hulk or a neogi is challenged at once,

and  attacked  if  they  cant  provide  a  good  accounting  of

themselves.

Urqo Zar uses its spell-like abilities of crushing despair and

charm monster to soften up enemy warriors, trying to make

them easy prey for the umber hulk and the bugbear  ghters.

Azri Voqq concentrates on spellcasters, hoping to enslave a

powerful wizard and thus gain great status for itself.

The  human  slaves  dont   ght  unless  directly  threatened.

As much as theyd like to be free, theyre terri ed of winding

up on the neogi menu if they try to help out attacking heroes

who end up getting killed or captured. Given a chance, some

or all might simply  ee as best they can.

5. MINDSPIDER WRECK (EL 8)

This vessel does not seem to have been made for the water. Its

masts jut out at all angles, and its largest hatch is on its under-

side, where it could not be opened were the vessel riding in the

water. The hatch leads into a dimly lit cargo bay about 40 feet

long and 10 feet high, and you can see smaller passages leading

off  to  various  other  compartments,  including  cramped  state-

rooms, weapons platforms, and a command deck.

the neogi de ler Jawarkk Fel to remain on board and make

sure that no one attempted any sabotage or pilfered from

the ships vault of high-value treasures. The vault is a room

with an iron door (DC 30 Open Lock or DC 25 to break) in

the center of the vessel. The neogi companys most valuable

goods are kept here; only Neex Hist and Rixxil Kas hold

keys to the door.

The treasure consists of 8,500 sp, 4,200 gp, 355 pp, twenty-two

gems averaging 100 gp in value, a jeweled ring worth 700 gp,

a  ne platinum chain worth 2,200 gp, six potions of cure light

wounds, a wand of searing light (20 charges), boots of the winterlands,

and a +2 holy longsword. Each neogi owns various shares in this

treasure,  preferring  not  to  risk  carrying  around  their  own

individual wealth in a temporary lair like the wreck site.

Jawarkk  possesses  an  unusual  slavea  gauth  (lesser

beholder). Jawarkk makes sure to keep the monster enslaved,

and watches it constantly for signs that it might be shaking

off the neogis in uence.

Jawarkk orders its gauth to attack intruders, and then seeks

an  opportunity  to  slip  through  the  ships  passageways  and

come up behind a party engaging the beholder. The de ler

looks for an opportunity to sneak attack someone who has

been stunned by the gauths gaze.

 New feat described on page 94.

Languages: Common, Undercommon, Terran, Abyssal.

Enslave (Su): Three times per day, a neogi de ler can try to

enslave  any  one  living  creature  within  30  feet.  This  ability

functions  similarly  to  a  dominate  monster  spell  (caster  level

16th;  Will  DC  14).  For  more  details,  see  the  enslave  ability

description on page 91.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 19 (17 when spit), initial

damage 1d4 Dex, secondary damage 1d4 Wis.

The neogi have moved most of their cargo, slaves, and personal

effects  from  the  damaged  ship  to  the  nearby  caves  while

repairs proceed.

Neex Hist, the neogi sorcerer that leads the group, did not

want  to  leave  the  ship  completely  unguarded.  It  assigned

Sneak Attack (Ex): Jawarkk Fel deals an extra 3d6 points

of  damage  on  any  successful  attack  against   at-footed  or

 anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to

ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures

104

with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and  creatures  immune  to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits

are all immune to sneak attacks. The de ler can choose to

deliver  nonlethal  damage  with  its  sneak  attack,  but  only

when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a

sap (blackjack).

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Jawarkk  Fel  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally allows it to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half

damage, it takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Trap nding (Ex): Jawarkk Fel can  nd, disarm, or bypass

traps with a DC of 20 or higher. It can use the Search skill

to  nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps

(DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If its Dis-

able Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, the

de ler discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering

or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Jawarkk Fel retains its Dexterity bonus

to  AC  even  when   at-footed  or  targeted  by  an  unseen  foe.

It  still  loses  its  Dexterity  bonus  if  paralyzed  or  otherwise

immobile.

Possessions: Bracers of armor +3, masterwork light crossbow

with 20 bolts, gloves of Dexterity +2, potion of cure moderate wounds,

potion of invisibility.

The  mindspider  can  be  repaired  to   y  again,  but  its  use

requires  a  magical  device  known  as  a  lifejammer.  It  slowly

drains the life force of a creature strapped into it. The neogi

do not share knowledge of how to operate the lifejammer or

maneuver the vessel with any other creatures, not even to save

their own lives.

6. SLAVE PEN (EL 3)

A short, steep slope leads down to a large cave lit by several dim

yellow  oil-lanterns.  Crude  sleeping  pallets  lie  along  the  walls.

Most are empty now. A long trestle table stands at one end of

the  cave,  with  a  small,  smoky  cooking   re  nearby.  Two  other

passages exit the cave, but theyre a good 15 feet above the  oor,

reachable only by a narrow and treacherous ledge that circles the

pitlike  oor. An armed bugbear stands here, keeping watch over

a handful of other humanoids.

Reaching the  oor of the pen, or the ledge from the pen  oor,

requires a DC 15 Climb check. Navigating the ledge to reach

the east or south exits requires a DC 10 Balance check or a DC

15 Climb check. The neogi and umber hulks, all quick and

skillful climbers, easily circle the pen in either direction. A

ladder is kept drawn up on the ledge near the north entrance,

where the guard is stationed; when he needs to get someone

into or out of the pen, he lowers the ladder.

The neogi have a total of seven human slaves (two here and

 ve in area 4),  ve orc slaves (two here and three in area 2), and

six goblin slaves (three here and three in area 2). The slaves are

supervised by  ve bugbear slave warriors (two in area 1, two

8. SORCERERS ROOST (EL 9)

Both the passages leading up to this cave from areas 6 and 7

require  DC  15  Climb  checks  to  negotiate,  due  to  the  steep

slope and lack of good footing.

The south passage descends steeply from a small, well-hidden

chimney or opening high on the cliffside overlooking area 4.

It also requires a DC 15 Climb check to descend.

A short, steep scramble up a sloping rift leads into another large,

sand- oored  cave  with  a  high  ceiling.  Shuttered  iron  braziers

or stoves smolder with warmth, but give off little light. On the

south side of the chamber, the rift continues to ascend into a nar-

rowing chimney or crevice through which the gleam of daylight

shows.  A  collection  of  odditiessmall  creatures  preserved  in

jars, clay vessels  lled with oils and powders, and a small table

cluttered with parchments and inkpotssuggests the workshop

of a wizard or sorcerer. Another of the spiderlike creatures works

here, scuttling around the desk on its quick feet, while an umber

hulk stands watch.

Its unusual for a neogi sorcerer to lead a band of the creatures,

but Neex Hists business ventures have been as successful as

its  arcane  experiments,  and  it  is  the  wealthiest  member  of

the crew that survived the crash. Of course, its ownership of

the dwarf neogi Urqo Zar (see area 4) has brought Neex Hist

prestige and wealth.

Hist does not expect any creatures other than neogi to appear

in its chambers. It attacks anyone without a neogi escort at

once, seeking to subdue them with its spells and its umber

hulks confusing gaze.

Neex Hist, Neogi Sorcerer 6: hp 48; see page 96.

Umber Hulk: hp 75; Monster Manual page 248.

Hist is not willing to  ght to the deathits own, anyway.

If badly injured, it  ees through whichever passage offers the

best chance of escape, hoping to rally help from the other neogi

in area 7, or the neogi and slaves in area 4. If escape appears

impossible, Hist is not above pleading for a parley to negotiate

the best deal it can for its life.

Most  of  Neex  Hists  wealth  consists  of  its  share  in  the

mindspiders vaults and its own personal equipment. It keeps a

small bit of spending money here in its retreat. Hidden beneath

a small rock on the  oor (Search DC 15) is a pouch containing

44 pp, 115 gp, a potion of cure light wounds, and a scroll of spell

immunity. (As a sorcerer, Hist cant use the scroll, but the neogi

knows its value in trade.)

in area 4, and one here) that answer to the umber hulks and

neogi, keeping the other slaves in line to win favor and stay

out of the cookpot. The neogi intend to take only a few of the

best slaves with them when they leave.

The slaves are sleeping or resting. Theyre kept here until

the neogi have a need for them. The orcs and goblins are used

as foragers and laborers, while the humans are reserved for

repair work on the mindspider.

The bugbear is stationed here to prevent mischief in the

slave pen, not to  ght a party of armed intruders. If suddenly

confronted  by  unescorted  adventurers,  he  quickly  retreats

back to area 7 or 8 to warn the neogi there that trouble is on

the way.

The slaves have little interest in  ghting the neogi. Theyre

certainly willing to turn on the bugbear, given the chance,

after which theyre interested only in getting away (although

the human slaves here tell any rescuing heroes about the other

slaves working on the mindspider in area 4).

7. NEOGI CAVERN (EL 8)

This large cave is dry and relatively  at and has a sandy  oor.

Several large iron braziers stand around the chamber, shuttered

so that they give off little light but plenty of warmth. A few casks

and  crates  scattered  about  seem  to  have  been  arranged  into

makeshift furnishings. Two of the small spiderlike creatures are

here, conversing in high-pitched hissing voices, while a big umber

hulk stands mutely watching.

The neogi chose this cavern for their personal quarters, since

its the most comfortable and secure of the caves. They like

their environment to be dimly lit and warm, and the braziers

burn with their big iron covers opened just enough to let the

coals within smolder for hours.

Anyone  who  appears  in  this  room  without  a  neogi  or

umber hulk escort is nothing more than a prize waiting to be

enslavedor so the neogi think. The umber hulk Kothogg

(area 1) belongs to the second neogi in this room.

Neogi (2): hp 21, 17; see page 90.

Umber Hulk: hp 71; Monster Manual page 248.

As always, the neogi keep well away from any melee combat

while the umber hulk does the hard work. The cave walls offer

several good perches 10 and 15 feet above the  oor, and the

neogi scramble up at the  rst sign of any threat.

Two small locked iron coffers (Open Lock DC 30) hidden

along the back wall hold 350 gp, 18 pp, four potions of cure light

wounds, a potion of lesser restoration, and a dozen small gemstones

averaging 10 gp in value each. These belong to Rixxil Kas, who

keeps them as a stash of easily accessible currency in case any

opportunity for a deal comes up.

readful  predators  of  the  dark,  grell  exist  as  horrible

blights of the underground and of dismal swamps and

forests. They entertain few schemes of world domina-

tion or the enslavement of other races. Instead, they are

primarily interested in colonizing as many worlds as possible,

and once ensconced in any particular world, enjoying to the

fullest the delicacies it offers. They are the eaters.

Grell  are  not  native  to  the  natural  world.  They  arose  in

some  distant  and  horrible  sphere  in  an  alternate  Material

Plane.  Driven  to  explore  the  multiverse  in  search  of  prey

to sate their unending hunger, grell long ago embarked on

migrations through world-spanning gates and across the dim

wastes of the Plane of Shadow to colonize as many new worlds

as possible. They are a fairly recent arrival in the world of

humanoids, having crossed over from the Plane of Shadow

after a long search for new worlds to infest.

Compared to creatures such as mind  ayers or aboleths,

grell are insular and reclusive. A nest of grell is a purely local

problem; the monsters gladly dine on any living creatures

they can catch, but they make no effort to in ltrate nearby

humanoid societies, enslave people, or in uence community

affairs. Humanoids are meat animals, and their dealings with

each  other  are  of  no  interest  to  the  grell.  The  threat  grell

pose to human society is incidental, not deliberate. Grell are

unlikely to conceive of schemes to bring a steady supply of

humanoids into their tentacles; instead, theyre more likely

to follow the herd and relocate their hunting grounds to

places where humanoids congregate. That said, a powerful

grell  colony  represents  a  spreading  blight  or  plague  of

predation that can eventually depopulate an entire region

if not dealt with.

GRELL

These  horrible,  misshapen  creatures  resemble  giant

 oating  brains  with  tentacles.  They  detest  sunlight

(although it causes them no harm) and inhabit dun-

geons, underground passages, remote caves, and other

places where light never reaches. Humanoids of all

kinds are their favorite prey.

Grell are most often found in a feral state, existing

as solitary hunters underground. However, they have

been known to gather into large colonies or nests.

Grell  that  belong  to  nests  have  access  to  strange

magical powers and weapons that feral grell do not

normally use. Fearsome grell philosophers, beings

that study alien science and deadly sorcery, govern

grell colonies.

Grell speak their own language, composed in part

of  invisible  and  inaudible  electrical  manipulation

that  very  few  other  creatures  can  perceive.  They

understand Undercommon but do not speak it.

This creature has a large, bulbous body composed of wrinkled,

light gray  esh that seems to  oat in the air of its own volition.

Ten long, spiny tentacles hang from the bottom of its body, twist-

ing in the air like ropes. It has a sharp beak in the front of its body,

but no other visible facial features.

A grell prefers to wait in ambush for potential prey. When a

suitable target passes, the monster attempts to paralyze it with

its tentacles, then escape to its lair with its helpless prey. Grell

are cunning enough to avoid direct confrontations with large

groups, since they are aware of the dangers that foes capable

of teamwork can present.

A grell occasionally shadows a group that is too large to

attack directly, following along inconspicuously and using

its  Hide  skill  to  stay  out  of  sight.  When  a  member  of  the

target group lags behind, or the group is distracted by some

other hazard, the grell attacks a straggler and tries to drag

its  meal  away  unnoticed.  Grell  also  sometimes  lurk  near

dangerous areas, such as pit traps, quicksand, or the lairs of

other monsters, hoping to prey upon trapped, helpless, or

wounded creatures.

A typical grell has a body about 3 feet in diameter and weighs

about 200 pounds. Its tentacles are about 8 feet long.

COMBAT

In  melee  combat,  a  grell  can  attack  as  many  foes  as  it  can

reach, using as many of its tentacles as it wishes against any

single opponent. It uses its bite only against paralyzed prey

or as a last resort.

An  opponent  can  attack  a  grells  tentacles  with  a  sunder

attempt as if they were weapons. A grells tentacles have 5 hit

points each. If a grell is currently grappling a target with the

tentacle that is being attacked, it uses another limb to make its

attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder

attempt. Severing one of a grells tentacles deals 2 points of

damage to the creature. The creature regrows severed tentacles

in 1d6 days.

Grell that belong to a nest or colony might be armed with

lightning lances (see page 115). Feral grell do not make or use

any weapons, relying on their own natural armament.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a grell deals

1d6+1 points of damage.

Expert Grappler (Ex): A grell that chooses to grapple with

one tentacle and remain ungrappled itself takes a 10 penalty

on its grapple checks instead of the normal 20 penalty (see

Improved Grab, page 310 of the Monster Manual, for details).

Grell  other  than  hatchlings  have  a  +10  racial  bonus  on

grapple  checks.  (Paralyzed  foes  automatically  lose  grapple

checks.)

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a grell must hit

an  opponent  of  its  size  or  smaller  with  a  tentacle  attack.  It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,

it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Paralysis (Ex): A grells tentacles are lined with small spiny

barbs, much like a squids. Any creature hit by a grells tentacle

must  make  a  DC  10  Fortitude  save  or  be  paralyzed  for  2d4

rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a 4

racial penalty.

Creatures struck by multiple tentacle attacks in the same

round do not make multiple saving throws; instead, they make

a  single  saving  throw,  but  the  DC  increases  by  1  for  every

additional tentacle that hit in the same round. For example, a

creature hit by four of a grells tentacle attacks must succeed

on a single DC 13 Fortitude save to avoid paralysis, instead of

four DC 10 saving throws.

Blindsight (Ex): A grell is blind, but it maneuvers and  ghts

as well as a sighted creature by using scent and vibration to

ascertain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 60 feet. The grell does not need

to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range

of its blindsight.

Flight (Ex): A grells body is unusually buoyant. The creature

continuously produces an effect like that of the  y spell, which

it can use to move at a speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverabil-

ity). This buoyancy also grants the grell a permanent feather

fall effect with personal range.

Sightless (Ex): A grell is immune to gaze attacks, visual

effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.

Skills: A grell gains a +2 racial bonus on Hide and Move

Silently checks.

GRELL PHILOSOPHER

A grell philosopher is an exceptionally intelligent and ruthless

member of the race, a malicious and dominating creature that

tolerates no threats to its native colony. The philosophers of

a colony decide matters through consensus and debate with

each other, and create alien devices and weaponry (such as

the lightning lance) for their followers use. The most powerful

philosophers are known as patriarchs. A typical patriarch is a

Large grell with 11 Hit Dice and 9 levels of wizard.

Grell philosophers share the special qualities and abilities of

the standard grell, but are armed with formidable wizard spells

in addition to their special abilities. They like to use spells

such as invisibility and obscuring mist against sighted creatures,

turning their blindsight into a deadly tactical advantage.

Spells:  A  grell  philosopher  is  a  4th-level  wizard  with  16

Intelligence.

Typical Wizard Spells Prepared (caster level 4th): 0daze (DC

13), detect magic, mage hand, touch of fatigue (+7 melee touch, DC

13); 1stcharm person (DC 14), mage armor, obscuring mist, ray

of enfeeblement (+6 ranged touch); 2ndinvisibility, protection

from arrows, summon monster II.

GRELL ANATOMY

Grell are the product of some dark and distant creation. They

arose in a parallel world or alternate plane where the laws of

nature are very different from those of humanoid worlds.

While adventurers might mistake a grells wrinkled, gray

hide for naked brain tissue, the monster is not in fact a dis-

embodied brain. Its skin is damp and gleams wetly in poor

light, but its epidermis is quite tough and leathery, measuring

several inches thick on its upper body. The coloration varies

from a pale pink-gray to a faint purple-pink hue. Older grell

are darker in color than younger grell.

A grells ten tentacles are rubbery and strong. Each is com-

prised of hundreds of ring-shaped muscles sheathed in a tough,

almost  brous, hide that is much thinner than the epidermis

of  the  main  body.  Sharp,  bony  barbs  or  needles  stud  each

tentacle every 2 to 3 inches, almost to its very tip. These hollow

barbs inject the grells paralytic venom into its victims. The

grell can partially retract its barbs into its tentacles to handle

or manipulate objects it doesnt want to pierce or tear. Each

tentacle is 5 to 8 feet long, although larger grell have longer

tentacles.

A  grells  beak  is  made  of  the  same  bony  substance  as  its

tentacle barbs. It is more similar to the calci ed shells secreted

by some mollusks than it is to true bone, having neither blood

vessels nor marrow. Grell have no bones other than their

beaks and their barbs. Their bodies are supported by a  ex-

ible, soft cagework of cartilage beneath the thick epidermis.

Although  they  dont  like  to  do  so,  grell  can  easily  squeeze

through surprisingly small openings, compressing their bodies

to about half their height or width with little trouble.

The  inner  arrangement  of  a  grell  is  quite  unusual.  The

creatures brain (labeled 1 on the diagram on the next page)

is a rumpled membrane or sheet that looks like a crumpled

piece of paper. It is located above the beak, near the front of

the creatures body. Above the brain, at the top of the anterior

portion of the body, lies a tangled mass of ganglia (2) that serves

as  the  center  of  the  grells  electroreceptive  sense.  Its  lungs

(3) are behind the brain, near the top center of the monster.

A grell has no heart, but instead has ten powerful vascular

chambers (4)  located in the body, near the base of each tentacle.

Constricting and relaxing in concert, these vascular chambers

serve to circulate its green, copper-based blood. The stomach

(5) is near the center of its mass, and its digestive tract  lls the

posterior third of its body.

Grell do not need to eat often. They favor large meals, with

long intervals in between. An adult grell can easily devour a

150-pound human in a sitting, but afterward might not need

to eat for up to three months. If food is plentiful or the oppor-

tunity presents itself, a grell does not hesitate to eat even if it

is not particularly hungry. A grell has to be very full indeed

to turn down a meal.

GRELL SENSES

Grell  do  not  have  eyes  and  are  completely  sightless.  They

have  keen  hearing  (the  entire  epidermis  serves  as  a  single

ear),  and  they  possess  a  mysterious  sense  best  described  as

electroreception. A grell senses the faint electrical auras of

living creatures and inanimate objects in its immediate vicin-

ity. While this ability is relatively short-ranged (60 feet), it is

quite discriminating. A grell can easily distinguish between

two  humans  of  different  sizes,  a  living  human  and  a  dead

human, or boulders composed of different types of stone by

means of its electroreception. A grell has some dif culty in

pqqqqqqqqqrs

BLINDING A GRELL

How can you blind something that doesnt have eyes? Its diffi-

cult, but it can be done. A grell does not lose its blindsight until

both its hearing and its electrical sense are impaired. Hearing

can easily be damaged by means of spells or effects that create

deafness or silence. The electrical sense is harder to obscure.

Powerful discharges of electricity can do it, even though grell

are normally immune to electricity. If a grell would have taken

20  points  or  more  of  electricity  damage,  the  monster  must

make a DC 15 Fortitude save or lose its electrical sense for 1d4

rounds. If it would have taken 40 points or more, the save DC

is 20, and electroreception is lost for 2d4 rounds.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

distinguishing  between  two  humans  of  similar  size  unless

they speakits keen hearing allows it to identify individuals

by their voices.

Taken together, grell hearing and electrical sense give the

creature  blindsight  out  to  60  feet.  Even  in  areas  of  magical

silence, grell electroreception keeps the creature from being

truly blinded by its lack of eyes.

REPRODUCTION

All grell begin life with no gender, but they can choose to

become males after they reach adulthood. Only about one in

 ve grell actually does so. Male grell mate about once every

ten  years,  choosing  a  nonmale  that  then  develops  female

characteristics. The pair lay several dozen eggs in a safe and

well-hidden cavern, and then have nothing more to do with

each other or their offspring. The female then reverts to its

gender-neutral status, but the male retains its gender. Older

and  more  powerful  grell  are  more  likely  to  become  males,

so  grell  leaders  are  referred  to  as  patriarchs.  In  any  event,

grell give gender and reproduction much less attention than

humanoids do.

DEVELOPMENT AND AGING

When young grell hatch, they are only about the size of a small

mug or a goblet (1 Hit Die, size Tiny), and they are not sentient.

They exist for years as verminlike hunters, feeding on small

rodents, insects, and reptiles. By the time they reach  ve years

in age, they are about half the size of an adult (2 Hit Dice, size

Small) and have gained self-awareness. Young grell spawned

near colonies normally begin to join their fellows around this

age, and reach their full growth at about ten years of age.

Grell grow throughout their lifetimes, and the oldest grell

are signi cantly larger and more powerful than younger ones.

It is risky for civilized grell to grow too large; the patriarch of

a grell colony destroys and consumes any potential rivals long

before they become powerful enough to challenge it. Grell that

anticipate this danger abandon the colony to continue their

existence as feral grell, growing larger and stronger far from

the suspicions of a patriarch. Only when the exile feels that it

is strong enough to mount a challenge to the patriarch does

it return.

Grell live about two hundred years in good health. At the

end of their lives, they undergo a fairly rapid degeneration, fail-

ing quickly in  ve to ten years after reaching their maximum

growth. Older grell ossify as their body tissues become dead and

rigid. Finally, they lose the ability to feed themselves and digest

their meals. Few grell reach the age of two hundred thirty.

GRELL VARIANTS

Unlike beholders or mind  ayers, grell show little physical

differentiation. A grell patriarch is little more than a grell

philosopher of great age and unusual physical power, while

a  grell  philosopher  is  simply  an  intelligent  but  otherwise

normal grell with an aptitude for magic.

GRELL SOCIETY

Grell lack the diversity of form and capability demonstrated

by some other aberration races. While they vary in size and

magical power, they all belong to the same species. The most

signi cant division in the race is cultural rather than physical:

Is the grell in question a feral grell or a civilized grell?

Feral grell are fearsome predators in the dark, lightless places

of the world. They tend to be solitary ambushers that hunt a

broad swath of territory, preying upon any creature they can.

They are cruel and murderous, and delight in taking sentient

creatures for their prey. Feral grell sometimes gather into small

packs in places where the hunting is good. A pack of feral grell

is far more dangerous than a similarly sized group of predatory

beasts or animals, since grell are intelligent enough to plan

sophisticated  ambushes  and  coordinate  their  attacks.  Even

large and well-armed parties of adventurers can be rendered

helpless  in  the  space  of  a  round  or  two  by  the  swift,  silent

assault  of  a  grell  pack,  and  any  party  overcome  in  such  an

attack meets a very bad end indeed.

Despite the name given to them by sages who study these

monsters, feral grell are far more than wild beasts. They are as

intelligent as their civilized cousins; in fact, an individual grell

can easily adjust to its circumstances by joining or abandoning

colonies several times in the course of its life, living as a solitary

hunter for a time before returning to the companionship of

others of its kind. Feral grell rarely have access to the weapons

and magic with which philosophers arm the members of grell

colonies.

Civilized grell gather in colonies or nests of several dozen

individuals. They retain more of the alien science and knowl-

edge of wizardry their ancestors commanded. Civilized grell

organize  loosely  into  three  castes:  soldiers,  philosophers,

and patriarchs. The grell themselves make little distinction

between individualssoldiers defer to philosophers because

magical ability brings higher status in the colony. Only patri-

archs hold any real preeminence, and even then, grell colonies

are ruled by a cold, pragmatic consensus of all adults, regardless

of caste.

The  chief  activities  of  a  grell  colony  are  collecting  food,

studying the secrets of alchemy, and preparing for expansion

into new lands (or even worlds). Grell do not engage in com-

merce, trade, manufacture, or leisure, nor do they have much

interest in traf cking with neighboring cultures. Grell relish

the hunt and the kill, and therefore have no specialized groups

of  food  collectors  or  foragers.  Each  grell  in  a  colony  must

obtain its own food or starve. Only a patriarch has the right

to demand prey from another grell, and even then, patriarchs

choose to hunt at every opportunity.

Grell are not builders. They create buildings and artifacts

(such as their lightning lances) only when necessary, and grell

outposts  consist  of  little  more  than  a  web  of  unimproved

caverns in which things of interest or value simply lie on the

 oor until needed. When grell do  nd reason to build walls,

structures, or furnishings, they craft them from grell crystal,

an alchemical mortar or plaster that can be used to make light,

strong walls of translucent gray crystal.

Since grell colonies dont raise food or build things, they

have little use for humanoid slaves. They sometimes maintain

herds of livestock (which might or might not include human-

oids) for eventual consumption. While grell would prefer to

stalk their meals in the wild, they recognize that keeping a

convenient  and  dependable  food  supply

close at hand allows grell with important

duties to spend less time hunting and

more  time  serving  the  interests  of

the  colony.  To  be  trapped  in  a  grell

larder is a terrible fate. The monsters

provide water and food (in the form of

edible fungus or mosses)

to  their  livestock,

but  otherwise  give

no  care  or  supervi-

sion to their captives.

Consequently, prison-

ers  ght desperate and

horrible battles with one

another to make sure that

someone else winds up

as  the  next  meal  taken

from the pen.

Sometimes,  grell  allow

useful captives to live for a time as

choosers of the eaten. A captive

willing to help grell lure more

prey into their graspor who

shows that he can keep good

order  in  the  pens  though

personal  strength,  cruel-

ty, or cunningcan

a  long  time  by

keeping  his

ed as anything other than a meat animal itself, of course, but

at least the chooser of the eaten is likely to be the last captive

devoured.

LANGUAGE

Most grell speak only their own language. Grell philosophers

know several additional languages, typically Common, Dra-

conic, and Undercommon. They study the languages of races

or cultures that live near their chosen hunting grounds.

Grell is hardly recognizable as a language. It consists of a

collection of buzzing rasps, clicks, and whistles, augmented

by  distinctive  manipulations  of  each  grells  own  electrical

aura. Roughly half the meaning of the language is carried by

the electrical signals, which are inaudible and invisible to any

creature lacking the electroreception sense of the grell. Grell

speaking to each other in their own language must be within

60 feet of one another to carry on complex conversations.

Because the language consists of both an audible and an

electrical component, grell can choose to speak in audible-only

or electrical-only modes. Much subtlety and detail is lost, but

simple communicationssuch as hunting signals, alarms, or

calls for helpcan easily be transmitted in only one medium.

Grell speaking to other grell more than 60 feet away resort to

audible-only speech, which allows their clicks

and buzzes to carry for hundreds of feet in

good  conditions.  Grell  within  60  feet  of

each other can communicate in absolute

silence by choosing electrical-only speech.

This is obviously quite useful in signaling

ambushes or coordinating a sudden attack.

RELIGION

Grell regard no creature or being

as truly divine. Gods are simply

entities  of  great

personal  power.

Grell

They

merit

respect  and

caution, but the

notion  of  adula-

tion or worship is foreign to

the grell mindset. Grell do not look for-

ward to any kind of afterlife, and they view

death  as  the  inevitable  cessation  of  existence

(although a few rare grell philosophers explore the possibility

of undeath, as their talents and opportunities permit).

While grell do not give any being their worship, they do

hold a certain admiration for the greatest of the eaters, crea-

tures whose dark hunger and destructive tendencies could

encompass  entire  worlds  given  a  chance.  Deities  such  as

Tharizdun or the Patient One are thus worthy of grell respect,

and deserve to be honored (or placated) from time to time. The

exact nature of this admiration varies from colony to colony,

depending on what each grell patriarch regards as suitable.

Some patriarchs direct their minions to offer sacri ces after

a  successful  hunt,  others  offer  sacri ces  during  dif cult

times, and still others never offer any sort of veneration at all,

concluding that the great eaters take what they want when

they choose to do so.

Rarely, a grell philosopher turns to these dark and hungry

powers, becoming a cleric of Tharizdun or the Patient One.

A grell priest is an unusual creature, and chooses to follow

its path not out of any desire to venerate a divine being, but

instead  to  gain  the  power  it  needs  to  ascend  to  patriarchy.

Grell priests regard their relationship with their patron deity

as a simple bargain; they gain access to a source of magic most

of their fellows cannot reach in exchange for offerings and

sacri ces.

Information about Tharizdun and the Patient One is pre-

sented in Chapter 9: The Aberration Hunter.

LEADERS

Grell  respect  strength  and  offer  little  deference  to  social

superiors unless those superiors are stronger, more clever, and

more powerful. Rather surprisingly, grell govern themselves

through consensus and debate. Unlike many other evil races,

which  debase  and  disenfranchise  weaker  specimens,  grell

view each member of their race as a colleague and an example

of a superior being. They are perfectly willing to assassinate

rivals or plot against a superior, but they do not seek to deny

any grell the opportunity to advance as far as its talents and

cunning can take it.

While  grell  are  inclined  to  be  egalitarian,  it  is  certainly

true that some grell are more equal than others. Grell respect

magical  ability  and  physical  strength,  so  individuals  with

more  Hit  Dice,  or  philosophers  with  superior  intelligence

and spellcasting ability, carry more weight in the debates and

arguments by which the colony governs itself. Its not unusual

for colonies to split into factions or cliques, each adhering to

the in uential arguments of a particular philosopher or strong

elder grell.

Even  a  patriarch  is  not  guaranteed  unanimous  support

from its lesser fellows. A patriarch leads only as long as the

colony  agrees  that  the  creature  is  still   t  to  do  so.  If  the

colonys judgment turns against a patriarch, it is killed or

driven into exile.

Languages: Grell,  Undercommon,  Common,  Draconic,

Elven.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a grell patriarch

deals 1d8+4 points of damage.

Expert Grappler (Ex): A grell that chooses to grapple with

one tentacle and remain ungrappled itself takes a 10 penalty

on  its  grapple  checks  instead  of  the  normal  20  penalty

(see  Improved  Grab,  page  310  of  the  Monster  Manual,  for

details).

Grell patriarchs have a +10 racial bonus on grapple checks.

(Paralyzed foes automatically lose grapple checks.)

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a grell must hit an

opponent of its size or smaller with a tentacle attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold and can constrict.

Paralysis (Ex): Any creature hit by a grell patriarchs tentacle

must  make  a  DC  16  Fortitude  save  or  be  paralyzed  for  2d4

rounds. Each additional tentacle that hits the same creature

that round increases the save DC by 1.

Sightless (Ex): A grell patriarch is immune to gaze attacks,

visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on

sight.

RELATIONS WITH OTHER RACES

To  a  grell,  all  other  beings  ultimately  fall  into  one  of  three

categories:  the  eaten  (a  very  broad  group  indeed,  including

humanoids, animals, and other creatures), the inedible (those

rare creatures whose physiology or nature makes them physi-

cally inedible to grell, and thus of little interest), and the great

eaters (those even rarer creatures that might prey upon grell).

Grell have absolutely no compunction about attacking and

devouring  creatures  that  belong  to  the  eaten  category.  Any

conversation or negotiation with such creatures is completely

at a grells convenience, and can be interrupted by an attack at

any moment. Grell are certainly intelligent enough to recognize

that just because they can eat a creature doesnt mean that it

is always wise or useful to do so. An evil human wizard who

supplies a grell with items of valueother humanoids as meals,

treasure, or interesting magical lore, for instanceis something

of a golden goose, not to be eaten on a passing whim. The dif-

 culty a humanoid faces in establishing such an arrangement

with grell lies in  nding a way to demonstrate his or her talents

in the  rst meeting with the eaters. In the end, even the most

useful ally is still a meat animal, to be devoured as soon as he

becomes more useful as a meal than as a minion.

Grell take little notice of creatures belonging to the inedible

category except in unusual circumstances. There is certainly

little  point  in   ghting  such  creatures,  so  given  the  choice,

grell are inclined to leave things such as intelligent constructs,

plants, or undead alone, and they expect the same in return.

From time to time, an especially innovative patriarch might

strike a deal with an inedible neighbor, such as a lich. Of all

other  beings,  the  inedible  are  the  most  likely  to  be  treated

equally and fairly by the grell, simply because the grell have

nothing to gain from them.

Grell have a more complex relationship with beings that are

considered great eaters. Their entire philosophy supports the con-

ceit that anything powerful enough to devour another creature

is entitled to do so: Might makes right. On the other hand, grell

loathe the idea of being reduced to the status of someone elses

eaten, and therefore go to great lengths to devour before they

are devoured. Subterranean monsters such as aboleths, behold-

ers, and mind  ayers are therefore admired for their power and

prowess, but detested at the same time. Grell sometimes accept a

wary truce with such neighbors, especially when a grell advantage

in numbers balances out the power of the other species, but if

there is a real disparity in strength, the grell either attempt to

annihilate their rivals or relocate their colony.

GRELL MAGIC

Grell sometimes undertake the study of arcane magic, becom-

ing formidable wizards and earning the title of philosopher.

However, arcane lore comprises only a portion of their super-

natural powers. Learned grell are the masters of a sinister alien

lore best described as grell alchemy.

Grell alchemy combines the manipulation of arcane magic

with  knowledge  of  natural  science,  chemistry,  andmost

importantthe physical laws and properties of the alien space

in which the grell originated. Obviously, not all of these prop-

erties can be easily replicated or manipulated in the natural

world, but grell philosophers labor long and diligently to  nd

ways to apply their knowledge of an alien spheres magical and

physical laws to their study of arcane matters in the human

world. Few human scholars can begin to make heads or tails

of grell spellcasting and item creation, simply because they

have no knowledge of the alien properties embodied in grell

arcane lore.

The  study  of  grell  alchemy  is  represented  by  the  Grell

Alchemy feat, described below.

GRELL ALCHEMY [ITEM CREATION]

A creature that has this feat has studied the alien and disturb-

ing arcane lore of the grell, and understands the magical and

physical laws by which their spells and devices function.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 3 ranks,

caster level 1st.

Bene  t: A creature with this feat can create grellcraft items,

including  lightning  lances.  Its  spells  are  partially  based  on

obscure physical laws, as opposed to magic alone, and therefore

gain  a  +2  bonus  on  spell  penetration  checks.  They  are  also

more dif cult to identify or dispel. Spellcraft checks made to

identify the spells and caster level checks made to dispel the

spells are made with a 2 penalty unless the identi er also

knows this feat.

GRELL ITEMS

In addition to the lightning lance, grell philosophers and craft-

ers  manufacture  several  other  unique  items,  all  described

below.

Due to their unusual anatomy, grell use magic items differ-

ently than humanoids do. A grell can wear:

Two amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts, or

scarabs embedded in the thick hide of its body.

Two pairs of bracers or bracelets on the thick upper portions

of two tentacles.

Up to four rings on the slender tips of four additional ten-

tacles.

Grell cannot wear headbands, hats, helmets, phylacteries,

lenses, goggles, vests, vestments, shirts, robes, suits of armor

(although  a  specially  made  suit  of  grell  barding  is  at  least

conceivable), belts, cloaks, capes, mantles, gloves, gauntlets,

boots, or shoes. Grell philosophers design unique items that

use the ring or amulet slots.

Grell Crystal

A dingy, translucent, dishwater gray in color, grell crystal is a

common building material in grell lairs. It is used to fashion

light walls, shelves, partitions, and utensils.

In its unset form, grell crystal is a dry powder made of small,

silver-gray  crystals  that  look  like  rough,  dirty  salt.  When

dropped  in  water,  the  crystals  expand  and  harden  into   at

sheets. One pound of crystal powder and 5 gallons of water

create a 25-square-foot sheet that is 1 inch thick and weighs 50

pounds. It takes about 1 hour for the sheet to grow to full size.

While it is growing, it can be pruned or shaped into speci c

forms with a little careful manipulation. Grell that work with

crystal take ranks in Craft (crystalwork) to make items.

When set, grell crystal has hardness 7, 20 hit points per inch

of thickness, a break DC of 20, and a Climb DC of 25. Grell

layer the crystal several inches thick when particularly strong

structures are needed.

Grell Alchemy and Craft (alchemy); Craft DC 20; Price 10 gp;

Weight 1 lb (unset).

Lightning Lance

Grell living in colonies or nests defend their homes with light-

ning lances, silver tubelike devices about 3 feet in length. These

weapons deal 3d6 points of electricity damage (no save) to

a single enemy within 60 feet with a

successful  ranged  touch  attack.  A

lightning  lance  usually  functions

only in the grasp of a grell, al-

though  a  DC  25  Use  Magic

Device check allows a character

of a different race to employ

the  weapon.  A  lightning

lance has 5 charges. Spent

charges are renewed each

day,  so  a  wielder  can  ex-

pend up to 5 charges in any

24-hour period.

Faint  evocation;  CL  3rd;

Grell Alchemy, shocking grasp;

Price 3,800 gp.

Greater Lightning Lance

A larger and more powerful

version of the lightning lance,

a greater  lightning  lance  is

found  in  the  tentacles  of  the

philosophers and patriarchs. It

resembles a slender silver tube 5

feet long. This weapon deals 5d6

points of electricity damage (no

save) to a single enemy with

a  successful  ranged  touch

attack  (range  60  feet).  If  this

touch  attack  hits,  the  electricity  bolt  then  arcs  to  a  second

target of the users choice within 30 feet of the primary target,

dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to the secondary target

with a second successful ranged touch attack.

A greater lightning lance usually functions only in the grasp

of a grell, although a DC 25 Use Magic Device check allows

a character of a different race to employ the weapon. A greater

lightning lance has 7 charges. Spent charges are renewed each day,

so a wielder can expend up to 7 charges in any 24-hour period.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Grell Alchemy, shocking grasp; Price

18,000 gp.

Silverspear

This  device  is  simply  a  +2  silvered  shortspear  designed  to  be

worn over the end of one of a grells tentacles. The silverspear

then replaces that tentacles attack. A normal adult grells ten-

tacle attack improves as follows: +7 melee (1d6+2/3). A grell

wielding a silverspear gains an additional 5 feet of reach with

that tentacle (15 feet for a typical adult grell). Tiny channels

in the weapons interior convey the grells paralytic poison to

the weapons head, so any creature struck by the silverspear is

subject to paralysis just as if it had been struck by the grells

tentacle.

Any creature other than a grell can use the weapon as a +2

silvered shortspear, but cannot paralyze with it.

SANGKON BHET

Beneath the jungle-covered ruins of an ancient human temple

lies a small outpost of grell that have taken to hunting the

nearby area by night. Sangkon Bhet is a fairly typical example

of a small grell outpost; the monsters occupy convenient ruins

or caverns for a time as they search out new places to move a

colony that has overhunted its previous locale.

The  ruins  of  Sangkon  Bhet  lie  in  a  sweltering  jungle,  a

few miles from populous plains that surround a port in the

southern seas. The temple above consists of little more than

jumbled  piles  of  stone,  overgrown  with  thick  creepers  and

split by towering trees that have grown up through the old

plazas and buildings above. Centuries ago, Sangkon Bhet was

dedicated to the worship of a fearsome and evil deity of dark-

ness, but it has been abandoned for many years now. The grell

occupied the site because its caves and underground burrows

served as suitable shelter from the hated sunlight.

The caves and chambers within the grell outpost conform

to the standard dungeon features described in the Dungeon

Masters Guide, with a few notable exceptions.

Most of the cavern areas are wet and dank, covered with

slippery moss and fungus. Add +5 to the DC of Balance, Climb,

or Tumble checks made in the outpost.

Streams  and  pools  in  the  caverns  are  still  and  shallow

(only about 1 to 2 feet deep). Characters must pay 2 squares of

movement and make DC 5 Balance checks to enter a stream

or pool square. A failure by 4 or less means that the character

stops moving for the round; a failure by 5 or more means that

the character falls prone in the square.

Rough terrain in the cavern consists of jumbled rocks, boul-

ders, and cave formations. Characters entering rough terrain

must pay 2 squares of movement to move 1 square. Since grell

 y, they naturally take no penalties for moving over streams,

pools, or rough areas.

Grell Crystal Doors: Doors made of grell crystal are located in

several areas. These have hardness 7, 20 hit points, and a break

DC of 20. They are simply shutters or panels that can be moved

aside to pass through.

Grell Crystal Walls: Walls of grell crystal are 4 inches thick.

They have hardness 7, 80 hit points, and a break DC of 29.

1. THE SINKHOLE (EL 3 TO 6)

Near  the  center  of  the  jungle-covered  ruins,  a  dank  staircase

winds down along the walls of a sinkhole 30 feet deep. The jungle

canopy overhangs the sinkhole, leaving the  oor of the place in

deep shadow. Trickling streams shower down the sides, collecting

in a pool at the north end. Most of the sinkhole  oor is covered

by moss and undergrowth.

Several cave mouths or  ssures lead off into darkness. These

include an opening at the foot of the staircase, another to the

east  where  a  stream   ows  into  a  cave  mouth,  and  one  to  the

south that seems to have been improved with stonemasonry.

The evil priests of Sangkon Bhet cut the stairs from the lime-

stone walls of the sinkhole to reach the sinkhole  oor and the

caverns below. The pool at the north end is about 10 feet deep

near the wall, but only 5 feet deep in most spots.

Characters who descend to the foot of the stairs (the spot

marked X on the map) come within range of the sentry grells

116

blindsight. If the sentry notices

intruders, it emerges from area

2 to attack.

Sentry  Grell:  hp  35,  light-

ning lance; see page 115.

Given  the  chance,

the  sentry  looks  for

opportunities  to  car-

ry  paralyzed  characters

above the pool and drop

them in the deeper part,

placing  them  at  serious

risk of drowning.

If hard-pressed by deter-

mined attackers, the sentry

 ees  by   ying  straight  up

the sinkhole wall. It then es-

capes  into  the  jungle  above,

unless it clearly has a safe line

of retreat to area 3 or 6.

A loud battle fought here can certain-

ly be heard by the grell in areas 3, 4, or 6.

The intervening distance provides a 10

penalty  on  their  Listen  checks,  and  the

noise of the stream adds another 5, for a

total penalty of 15. (Adult grell have Listen

modi ers of +4.)

One grell from area 3 and another from area 6 arrive 3

rounds  after  the  round  in  which  they  hear   ghting  in  the

sinkhole.  The  philosopher  in  area  4  does  not  investigate,

trusting to its fellows to handle any kind of trouble.

2. SENTRYS CAVE (EL 4)

This  dismal  cave  is  choked  with  a  tangled  mass  of  thick  roots

descending from the ceiling 20 feet overhead and partially cov-

ering the walls. Ancient human skeletons stand tangled in the

roots.

The skeletons are the remains of old Sangkon Bhet apostates,

chained  to  the  walls  and  forgotten  here  long  ago.  They  are

unsettling, but not dangerous.

This  cave  serves  as  the  post  for  the  colonys  sentry,  who

lurks hidden among the roots and debris in the upper part

of the chamber and watches the bottom of the stairs in area

1. If the sentry misses intruders coming down the stairs, it

certainly attacks when they enter this room. The grell gains a

+4 circumstance bonus on its Hide check because its dangling

tentacles blend in very well with the roots in the ceiling (total

Hide modi er of +12).

This chamber is also infested with several ferocious cen-

tipedes. The arthropods have learned to avoid the grell, but

quickly attack any other creatures that enter the room.

A grell lurks in ambush,

waiting for prey to happen by

One of the skeletons wears the mold-

ering remnants of bronze banded mail.

In a pouch inside its armor (DC 10 Search check, unless the

armor is removed, in which case the pouch is found automati-

cally) are four  ne violet garnets, each worth 300 gp.

If  the  sentry  is  killed  by  intruders  who  later  leave  the

complex, the two grell from area 3 are posted here in case the

invaders decide to return.

3. GRELL LAIR (EL 5)

A  rough,  narrow,  natural  passage  branches  away  from  the

stonework passage, climbing upward over a dif cult slope of slick

round boulders. Beyond lies a large cavern, its ceiling pierced by

hanging tree-roots. Discarded bones lie scattered over the  oor.

This chamber is home to two normal grell. They range far into

the jungle above in search of prey. The bones are the remains

of  consumed  animalsseveral  deer  and  an  assortment  of

smaller creatures.

If the grell hear a  ght in area 1, one grell goes to investi-

gate, while the other remains here and hides. If the grell are

warned by the loud approach of a party of intruders in the

passage outside, they both hide here among the roots in the

ceiling and prepare an ambush. The roots in this chamber

are not as dense as those in area 2, and so the grell gain only

a +2 circumstance bonus on Hide checks here (total Hide

modi er +10).

Grell (2): hp 33, 25; see page 108.

In  an  inconspicuous   ssure  in  the  southern  part  of  the

room (Search DC 15), one of the grell has stashed some loot it

acquired when it attacked and killed a river trader a few weeks

ago. Two large leather pouches hold 260 sp, 185 gp, and 18 pp,

as well as  ve small gemstones worth 20 gp each and a potion

of cure light wounds.

4. HIDDEN TEMPLE (EL 8)

A  landing  of  damp,  uneven  stone  blocks  overlooks  a  large,

impressive chamber made of dressed stone. Four pillars carved

like snakes support a ceiling 20 feet high, and a large alcove at

the northern end of the chamber holds a great stone idola six-

armed snake-woman with various deadly weapons in her grasp.

The  paving  blocks  of  the   oor  have  cracked  and  settled  badly

enough for a stream to run through the middle of the chamber.

The water  ows from a passage in the north wall and vanishes

into a narrow dark  ssure in the south wall. A masonry passage

in the east wall leads down into darkness.

The  oor of the room is littered with strange odds and ends

heaps of white sand, old bronze urns  lled with dark oils, sacks

of roots and tubers, and stone workbenches on which lie sharp,

silver implements.

This room was formerly a hidden shrine of the Sangkon priests,

used for the darkest and most secret of their foul rites.

The passage leading from this room to area 6 is blocked by

a grell crystal wall, but the wall features a small culvert (1 foot

diameter) that permits the stream to pass through.

A grell philosopher appropriated the shrine as its workspace

and living quarters. This philosopher specializes in the study

of necromantic magic, and it used its command undead spells

to assume control over several gnoll skeletons left here long

ago by the evil priests.

The  necrophilosopher  is  fully  aware  of  the  advantage  its

 ight ability offers. It hovers near the ceiling, using its spells

(summon monster III, summon swarm, ray of enfeeblement, and

ray of exhaustion) to wear down a party of dangerous enemies

while its skeleton minions attack. It joins the battle only when

its enemies have been weakened.

Several large stone urns in the northwest corner of the room

hold 175 sp, 855 gp, a pouch containing  ve small agates worth

25 gp each, and two scrolls: invisibility and  re shield.

Constrict  (Ex): On  a  successful  grapple  check,  the  grell

necrophilosopher deals 1d6+1 points of damage.

Expert  Grappler  (Ex): A  grell  that  chooses  to  grapple  with

one tentacle and remain ungrappled itself takes a 10 penalty

on its grapple checks instead of the normal 20 penalty (see

Improved Grab, page 310 of the Monster Manual, for details).

The grell necrophilosopher has a +10 racial bonus on grapple

checks. (Paralyzed foes automatically lose grapple checks.)

an  opponent  of  its  size  or  smaller  with  a  tentacle  attack.  It

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,

it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Paralysis (Ex): Any creature hit by the grell necrophilosophers

5. THE WATERS OF DEATH (EL 6)

The doors leading into this chamber from area 4 are made of

ancient bronze, cast into threatening shapes.

At the bottom of the stairs you  nd a double door, green and cor-

roded with age. You can barely discern disturbing skeletal  gures

cast in the ancient bronze. Grinning skulls and bony claws cover

the door.

While the door is somewhat threatening, it is not dangerous. It

is stuck, requiring a DC 21 Strength check to force open.

The chamber beyond the ancient door is some kind of dark shrine

or crypt. Moldy bas-reliefs carved in the stone walls glorify images

of  gruesome  death,  showing  skeletal   gures  sacri cing  living

humans on skull-covered altars. Several huge stone urns, easily 5

feet tall, stand along the walls. In the center of the room stands

a pool or fountain about 10 feet across. The pool is enclosed in a

knee-high masonry wall and is  lled with black, still water. A small

stone altar stands against the east wall, and on the north wall, a

barrier of dull gray crystal seals off another exit from the room.

The evil priests of Sangkon Bhet sacri ced prisoners to their

sinister deities in this room, drowning them in the ceremonial

urns. Each urn contains a human skeleton immersed in dark,

foul water, and the large pool in the center of the room holds

a sinister guardiana drowned mummy. The grell quickly

learned that the undead in this room were content to leave

them alone as long as they did not intrude, and so they sealed

the northern entrance and closed the western doors.

Skeleton (7): hp 6 each; Monster Manual page 225.

Mummy: hp 60; Monster Manual page 190. Due to its long

immersion, the mummy has no vulnerability to  re.

The undead animate and attack if any living creature handles

one of the urns, touches the waters of the pool, or approaches

within  5  feet  of  the  altar  without  performing  the  proper

obeisance. It takes the skeletons 1 round to clamber out of the

urns, and the mummy begins the  ght lying prone (and quite

hidden) in the black water of the pool.

The foul muck in the bottom of the pool is littered with

ancient gold coins; throwing coins into the water was part of

the rites held here. The pool contains 740 gp, 44 pp, and a gold

circlet worth 240 gp.

6. STALAGMITE FOREST (EL 5)

This large cavern is  lled with the sound of rushing water. A shal-

low, swift stream  ows along the western wall of the chamber.

Large  numbers  of  stalagmites  and  stalactites  dominate  the

room; some of them are quite striking.

If one of the grell in this room is killed, the other attempts

to flee and warn the patriarch in area 10 that the outpost

is under attack. If only one grell is in this room (presum-

ably because the other went to investigate trouble in area

1 and did not return), it flees when reduced to half its hit

points.

7. CAPTIVES CAVE

The  door  leading  into  this  chamber  is  secured  from  the

outside.

A door of thick, gray crystal  lls this branch of the passage. The

middle panel looks like it could be folded or moved to allow entry,

but several thick rods or bars of the same crystalline substance

hold it in place from this side.

Removing  the  bars  from  the  outside  takes  only  a  few

moments.

A steep, slick slope of wet limestone leads down to the  oor 15

feet below. A still pool of water  lls the northern end of the room.

The  oor is littered with bonesmostly game animals, but some

look like they might have belonged to humanoids.

The grell use this cave as a pen for captives or livestock they

dont intend to devour immediately. Typically, the monsters

simply  drop  their  victims  down  into  the  cavern  with  little

concern  about  damaging  them,  then  retrieve  them  when

hungry.

Anyone trying to climb up to the door from the cavern  oor

must succeed on a DC 15 Climb check. Forcing the door open

once its barred from the outside requires a DC 25 Strength

check.

Currently, the room holds no prisoners. This is an excellent

place to add an NPC to rescue, if the DM wants to customize

the lair.

Player characters defeated but not killed in other parts of

the complex are likely to wake up in this chamber, disarmed

but not yet devoured. Escaping from the room before the grell

decide to have their next meal poses a formidable challenge for

characters weakened by a losing battle and deprived of their

equipment.

8. PHILOSOPHERS CHASM (EL 6)

This cavern is more like a pit than a cave. The  oor drops away

sharply  from  the  crystal  door,  and  jagged  stalagmites  dot  the

bottom of the shaft almost 30 feet below. Odd spots in the cham-

ber walls serve as ledges, on which small urns, sacks, and metal

coffers perch precariously.

Large parts of the cavern  oor are uneven,  lled with stalag-

mites or the broken remnants of these formations. Two adult

grell use this chamber as their lair. Sounds of  ghting in area

1 might draw one of the grell to investigate (see area 1).

Grell (2): hp 38, 27; see page 108. The larger grell carries a

silverspear (see page 115).

This chamber is the home of the outposts second philosopher.

Negotiating the steep, sharp slopes of the chamber requires

a DC 20 Climb check; any creature falling from the ledge by

the door into the chasm takes 3d6 points of falling damage

and takes 1d4 attacks (+8 melee, damage 1d6 points) from the

jagged stalagmites below.

The ledges are  lled with various materials and reagents

necessary for the philosophers studiesrare earths, sands,

salts, powders, and interesting natural specimens.

Grell Philosopher: hp 56; see page 109.

The philosopher in this room has no avenue of retreat. It

conceals  itself  with  obscuring  mist  (it  sees  through  the  mist

just  ne, due to its blindsight) and tries to paralyze

characters in the doorway so that they fall

onto the jagged rocks below.

The philosopher has amassed

a  small  hoard  from  its  ex-

plorations of the surface

ruins  and  neighbor-

ing  lands.  It  keeps

its  treasure  in  the

metal  coffers  on

the ledges: 265 gp,

290 sp, three mal-

achite gemstones

worth  15  gp

each, two per-

idots worth 60

gp  each,  an  ame-

thyst worth 300 gp,

and a silver bracelet

worth 110 gp.

If  the  patriarch  in

area  10  is  killed,  this

philosopher  takes  over  the

leadership of the outpost (none of

the other grell trust the necrophiloso-

pher in area 4).

9. WATERFALL CHAMBER

(EL 5)

The roaring of water thunders in this large cavern. A swift stream

runs along the far wall, disappearing over a small cascade into

the lightless depths below. Strange fungi sprout among the sta-

lagmites and slippery  owstone of the cavern  oor.

worth 60 gp, a small opal worth 150 gp, and four banded agates

worth 8 gp apiece.

10. PATRIARCHS LAIR (EL 10)

A short but steep slope of damp boulders climbs up to a large

cavern   lled  with  striking  phosphorescent  fungi.  The  weird,

eldritch light of the chamber illuminates a litter of

animal bones on the  oor

and  tangled  heaps  of

humanoid  gear

armor,  weapons,

and  clothing.  At

the east end of the

room,  a  narrow

crevice  vanishes

into gloom.

The  patriarch

of  the  out-

post  chose

this  chamber

as  its  personal

lair.  It  is  cur-

rently evaluating

the  question  of

whether  to  move

the  rest  of  its

colony  to  the  cav-

erns below Sangkon

Bhet. While the upper

caverns could not comfortably house

many more grell, the lower caverns might

serve a colony well.

The  humanoid  gear  belongs  to  a  small

party of traders and explorers ambushed by the patriarchs

scouts  a  few  days  ago.  The  unfortunate  explorers  were

devoured soon after being brought to the outpost. The narrow

crevice at the east end of the room leads down to the river pas-

sage described in area 9. While it is a tight  t for the patriarch,

the grell hopes that it could escape that way if need be.

The patriarch and its latest victim

This cavern serves as a guard post for grell assigned to defend

the  patriarchs  lair.  Two  grell  lurk  here,  keeping  watch,

although both spend a lot of time near the stream, hoping to

spear a blind cave  sh.

Grell  (2):  hp  34,  30;  see  page  108.  Both  are  armed  with

lightning lances.

The grell are loyal to the patriarch, but hesitate to sacri ce

their lives for it. The waterfall in the eastern part of the room

leads to a narrow, dank, subterranean river passage that winds

for several hundred yards before emerging on the surface from

the side of a hill. If one grell is killed, the other attempts to

escape  through  this  passage,  which  includes  several  tight

squeezes that would be dif cult for humans (Escape Artist

DC 15).

One of the grell has collected a small handful of interesting

gemstones  from  the  nearby  jungle,  including  a  tourmaline

Grell Patriarch: hp 147; see page 113.

The patriarch is inclined to stand its ground against all

but the most dangerous enemies. It uses greater invisibility

early in the  ght and attacks brazenly, seeking to overcome

intruders with a sudden assault. If the heroes seem capable

of defeating its invisibility, the monster uses web or slow to

hinder the party while picking on lone characters who are

far from help.

The patriarch has naturally claimed the lions share of

the treasure discovered in and around the ruins of Sangkon

Bhet. Its loot consists of 3,700 sp, 2,900 gp, 55 pp, a fine

jade statuette worth 650 gp, two rubies worth 300 gp each,

and three small diamonds worth 230 gp each. The explor-

ers  belongings  include  a  suit  of  +2  studded  leather  armor,

a +1 flaming short sword, a cloak of elvenkind, and a scroll of

neutralize poison.

urderous assassins and in ltrators from a cold

and distant world, the tsochari come to this

world to steal magic for their own nefarious

purposes. Their appetite for arcane lore is limit-

less, and every tsochari success feeds their dark hunger for

more and more magic. Tsochar spies and imposters prowl the

streets of human cities, haunt the halls of wizards guilds, and

secretly seek out and attack the isolated towers of powerful

mages. In a kingdom suffering the deadly plague of a tsochar

incursion, anyone might be a puppet of the alien invaders,

and no one can be trusted.

The tsochari hail from a world distant in space, a cold and

lightless place so remote that the sun is little more than a

bright star in a black sky. Long ago, evil wizards or cultists

built  gates  linking  certain  terrible  ruins  in  the  normal

world  with  the  horrible  world  of  the  tsochari.  Through

these ancient gates, the tsochari steal into the world to roam

human  lands  and  in ltrate  human  society.  Humanoids

of  interestfavored  minions,  powerful  allies,  or  hapless

captivesare sometimes taken back through these gates to

the tsochar world. By all accounts, it is a place of numbing

cold, thin air, shrieking winds, and madness- lled gloom,

where monsters far worse than tsochari stalk the ruins of

antediluvian civilizations.

Tsochar  incursions  are,  thankfully,  rare.  Either  the

tsochari are not a numerous race, or they are limited in

their ability to use the world-spanning gates that allow

them to enter the human world. They are not as prevalent

or dangerous as powerful aberration civilizations such

as those of the aboleths or mind  ayers, and not as indi-

vidually powerful or as commonplace as the dreadful

beholders. The tsochari pose a different sort of threat,

one of in ltration and assassination. The common folk

of a human land have little to fear from the tsochari,

but the learned arcanists and mages have reason to be

worriedif they suspect they are being watched.

barbs  studding  its  long  tentacles.  If  the  creature  has  a  central

body, its hidden deep in the nest of writhing tendrils.

Fearsome invaders from a distant realm, the tsochari are a race

of monstrous imposters, creatures that can steal the bodies of

their victims and pass unnoticed in humanoid society. They

lust after magic, especially arcane magic, and eagerly seek out

humanoid wizards to replace so they can gain access to spells

they otherwise could not wield.

A tsochar resembles a tangled mess of knotted ropes or a

ball of barbed wire. It has dozens of thin but strong tentacles,

each studded with small, sharp, sicklelike claws. Its body is

little more than a thickening and joining of its multiple limbs.

The creatures eyes are small, dark orbs that rest at the end

of smaller, thinner tentacles, well hidden in the mass of its

other limbs, and its mouth is a round, lampreylike ori ce in

the middle of its underside. The tsochar is an indigo blue in

color, with a mottled pattern of lighter blue spots on its upper

surface.

Tsochari speak their own language, but they can use their

telepathy  to  communicate  with  other  creatures.  A  typical

tsochar is about 2 feet in diameter, although some of its longer

tentacles trail as much as 6 to 8 feet from its central mass, and

weighs about 25 pounds.

COMBAT

A  tsochar  is  not  often  found  in  its  own  body.  Typically,  it

hides in the body of a humanoid it is inhabiting or replacing

(see below), keeping its presence a secret. Since the monster

does  not  gain  the  memories  of  those  it  replaces,  it  is  not

dif cult to detect its masquerade with some careful question-

ingalthough a tsochar rarely lingers long enough for its

cover to be blown.

While inhabiting a humanoid, a tsochar has few options in

combat. Other than directing its host to  ght as it commands,

it can take no other physical actions. A tsochar replacing a

humanoid might have access to arcane spells previously known

by  its  victim,  but  the  creature  employs  spells  sparingly  in

combat, since it cannot recover spells it expends.

A tsochar in its own form can easily rip unarmored humans

to shreds with a buzzsaw of tentacle lashes and rakes. However,

the creature is much more inclined to stalk and ambush soli-

tary victims than to attack a group. It seeks to grab and wrap

itself around a foe, squeezing and poisoning him or her into

helplessness with its iron-hard tentacles. Once the victim is

immobilized, the tsochar can wear the victims  esh.

Constrict  (Ex):  A  tsochar  deals  2d4+2  points  of  damage

with a successful grapple check. When a tsochar deals damage

by  means  of  its  constrict  attack,  it  injects  its  victim  with

poison.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tsochar must hit

with two tentacle attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If

it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can con-

strict.

Tsochari receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which

is already included in the statistics above.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary

damage 1d3 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based. A tsochars

poison  is  delivered  by  dealing  damage  with  its  constrict

attack.

Take Spells (Su): A tsochar that replaces a spellcaster (see

below) retains any arcane spells prepared by the dead character,

and can cast them as if it had prepared the spells itself. The

tsochar must meet the minimum ability score needed to cast

the spell based on the type of caster replaced (Intelligence for

a wizard, for example), or else the spell is unavailable to it. If

the tsochar replaces a spontaneous caster such as a sorcerer, it

retains the available spell slots of the dead spellcaster, and can

use any spells the dead host knew. In either case, the tsochar

cannot regain spells or spell slots it expends from the dead

characters spellcasting ability.

Wear Flesh (Su): A tsochar can bore its way into a help-

less living creatures body, slipping its ropy tendrils into the

spaces  between  organs  and  muscles  and  disappearing  into

the victim. The victim must be the same size as the tsochar

or larger, and the process requires 1 minute. The tsochar can

choose to replace or inhabit the victim (see below). Incorporeal

creatures and constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead

are immune to this ability.

A tsochar can abandon a body it has inhabited or replaced

with a full-round action that deals 3d6 points of damage to

the host. A tsochar can be forced to abandon the body by a

remove disease or dispel evil spell (the caster must succeed on

a DC 20 caster level check to expel the monster, which deals

damage as described above) or a heal or limited wish spell (which

automatically succeeds and causes no damage to the host).

Inhabit: The tsochar leaves its victim alive and aware. Any

time it cares to, it can in ict indescribable agony on its host

as a standard action, dealing 1d6 to 6d6 points of damage and

requiring the host to succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be

nauseated by the pain for 2d4 rounds. The tsochar chooses

how much damage it deals with this attack.

The tsochar can take no physical actions while inhabiting

a  host,  but  it  can  use  purely  mental  actions  (such  as  com-

municating with its host by means of its telepathy power and

threatening to injure or kill the host unless the host does as

the monster wishes).

When the host takes damage (other than damage the tsochar

in icts on it), the inhabiting tsochar takes half that damage.

For example, if the host takes 28 points of cold damage from a

cone of cold spell, the tsochar takes 14 points of cold damage.

A  tsochar  inhabiting  a  humanoids  body  feeds  on  the

creatures blood and tissues, dealing 1d3 points of Constitution

damage per day. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save reduces

this damage by half. Over the course of days, frail humanoids

carrying tsochari sicken and die, although tsochari are clever

enough to direct their hosts to acquire curative magic to keep

themselves alive inde nitely, if the situation calls for it.

Replace: The tsochar bores out the victims nervous system,

killing the victim. It then animates the body, effectively acting

as the nervous system of the dead host. The body remains alive,

hosting the tsochar.

This functions like a polymorph spell into the victims exact

form, except that the tsochar can remain in the victims form

for up to a year, and it leaves the victims corpse behind when it

chooses to end the effect. The tsochar uses the victims physical

ability scores in place of its own, as described by polymorph.

The tsochar can remain in this form inde nitely, but once it

abandons the form, it cannot reanimate the body.

Tsochari that have replaced a humanoid slowly devour their

new shell from the inside out. A replaced body takes 1d4 points

of Constitution drain per month, which does not heal naturally

and can be restored only by magical means. A successful DC 15

Fortitude save reduces this damage by half. Naturally, tsochari

imposters choose to abandon bodies they have replaced before

they become too weak to be serviceable.

Telepathy (Su): A tsochar can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Skills: Tsochari have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and

use their Dexterity modi er instead of their Strength modi er

for Climb checks. They can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened. Tsochari have a +4 racial

bonus on Use Magic Device checks.

TSOCHAR CHARACTERS

Most tsochari advance by Hit Dice. The leaders of the race, the

tsochari nobles, add class levels in arcane spellcasting classes.

The most powerful tsochari wizards are capable of opening

gates between the tsochari world and the Material Plane to send

their agents into humanoid cities and kingdoms.

Tsochari revere a deity known as Mak Thuum Ngatha, the

Nine-Tongued Worm (see page 177). Tsochari clerics are rare,

but not unheard of, and have access to the domains of Destruc-

tion, Knowledge, Madness, and Travel.

TSOCHAR ANATOMY

The tsochari are products of an alien world. Tsochar  esh is

freakishly  strong  and  tough,  more  like  iron  cable  than  the

bodies of creatures of this world. This accounts for their damage

reduction and their surprising strength.

A tsochar is not actually a single living creature, but instead

an aggregate being. Each of the dozens of coiling tentacles

and limbs that seem to comprise its body is, in fact, a living

creature in its own right, known as a strand. A strand has its

own nervous system and organs of respiration, digestion, and

reproduction. Carefully detached from the rest of the body, a

tsochar strand could live on inde nitely, but it would be virtu-

ally mindless. Only in close association with twenty or thirty

similar strands, linked by nerve ganglia and blood vessels into

a tangle, do the tsochar strands achieve a collective sentience

and sense of self.

Like some of the simplest animals found in the mundane

world  (such  as  jelly sh),  the  tsochar  strands  show  a  degree

of specialization for certain tasks. For example, the creatures

lampreylike mouth (labeled 1 in the diagram on the next page)

is actually a specialized structure composed of the mouthparts

of  four  to  eight  strands,  fused  together  in  common  growth.

Fighting  and  motive  limbs  are  another  specialization,  as  are

the sensory limbs with their dark eye-structures (2) at the tips.

Since they share nervous tissue, blood vessels, and sentience, the

tsochar strands collectively form a single entity, just as vulner-

able to physical damage as a more mundane form of life.

A tsochar strand is about 3 to 8 feet in length and averages

about  half  an  inch  in  diameter,  but  it  commonly  coils  and

tangles  with  other  strands  close  to  the  center  of  the  body.

Tsochar strands are strikingly strong and tough for their size

and weight, armed with numerous sicklelike barbs (3). The

barbs contain small grooves or channels through which the

tsochar can inject its poison, but each barb administers only

a  tiny  dose.  It  takes  numerous  tentacles  working  together

to administer a dangerous dose of venom, which is why the

tsochar only poisons creatures it is constricting.

The internal arrangement of a tsochar is minimal for such

a complex creature. Within each strand, the vital organs are

concentrated within a foot or so of the front end, the part of

the creature that binds itself to the other strands. The brain

(4) is a studded string of nerve ganglia resembling a string

of pearls. The digestive tract (5) is an undifferentiated gullet

that absorbs food from the collective mouth of the monster.

Each strand pumps its own blood through a constriction of

its motive muscles, which is why a tsochar at rest coils and

TSOCHAR SENSES

Unlike some of the other aberration races, tsochari enjoy little

in the way of truly extraordinary senses. Tsochari see well in

complete darkness and have an uncanny knack for seeing

heat,  although  they  do  not  possess  true  infrared  vision.  A

tsochar typically has between  ve and ten eye-strands, well

hidden in the mass of motive and  ghting limbs. Each eye

is somewhat weak, but by focusing multiple eyes on objects

of  interest,  tsochari  attain  a  visual  acuity  equal  or  superior

to human vision under good conditions. Since tsochari use

multiple eyes on the same target, they do not possess the all-

around vision one might expect of a creature with many eyes

and no particular bodily orientation.

Tsochari hearing is comparable to human hearing, despite

the conditions of their native world. Undoubtedly, the shriek-

ing winds scouring their homeworld made hearing a sense that

provided little information to the forebears of the race. They

have no true sense of smell, and instead taste their environment

much like snakes do, sampling scents through their hidden

mouthparts. Tsochari do not have very acute senses of touch,

since their hard  esh resists small impressions or stimuli that

a soft-skinned human notices easily.

The most unusual tsochari sense is their telepathic ability.

The race is somewhat empathic, and can easily receive and

transmit  information  through  telepathy.  Some  tsochari  are

so sensitive that they can detect and locate nearby creatures

by  their  mental  signatures,  but  most  tsochari  do  not  ascer-

tain  another  creatures  presence  through  mental  awareness

alone.

PARASITISM

More so than other aberrations, tsochari are physically associ-

ated with creatures of other races. Monsters such as aboleths,

grell, and mind  ayers frequently eat or enslave humanoids,

but tsochari possess the unique capability of inhabiting the

124

living  bodies  of  other  creatures,  sometimes  for  months  or

years at a time.

While  a  tsochar  can  skillfully  position  its  thin  tendrils

within  its  hosts  body  cavity  without  killing  the  victim,  it

still requires a fair amount of room. Tsochar can only enter

the bodies of creatures that are their own size or larger. Thus,

a typical tsochar, which is size Small, can enter a victim that

is size Small or larger. Tsochari lose the ability to invade Small

humanoids as they grow older, simply because they grow too

big to  t in their bodies. They can and do infest larger creatures,

given the chance.

A tsochar establishes physical contact with the key nerves

and blood vessels of its victim by growing the

ganglia  connecting  its  own  limbs  into

the key parts of its victims anatomy.

The monster can deliberately avoid

in icting  lethal  injury,  remain-

ing an unwelcome

hitchhiker

hiding  in  the

victims  body,  or

it  can  set  about

ripping  out  and

replacing  brain

tissue,  major  nerves,  and  other  critical

parts.  In  the  former  case,  the  victim

revives, awake and quite aware that an alien

presence is now ensconced in his or her body.

In the latter case, the victim suffers a death of

indescribable agony, leaving behind a ready-

made shell for the tsochar to masquerade in.

A humanoid carrying a tsochar in his or her

body appears normal enough at a quick glance,

but  a  closer  look  shows  several  telltale  signsa

slightly  distended  abdomen;  long,  snakelike  cordings

bunched  beneath  the  skin;  and  glints  of  blue-black  alien

 esh  in  the  navel,  the  throat,  or  the

ear canal.

REPRODUCTION

Tsochari are completely hermaphroditic.

Each  tsochar  strand  is  both  male  and

female, and the creature can spawn any

time it cares to. In general, a tsochar reproduces once every

 ve to ten years, laying a clutch of about one hundred small,

tough eggs. Each egg hatches into a single undifferentiated

tsochar strand. A single strand is not a new tsochar; instead,

thirty to forty must assemble into a collective tangle before

a new tsochar comes into existence. New tangles can spring

from a single parent, but tsochari take no special steps to make

sure that this happens. In places where tsochari breed, its more

common for a new tsochar to arise from strands hatched by

multiple parents, as egg-clutches from several different tsochari

An adult tsochar

hatch and intermingle. Thus, a single mature tsochar might

have anywhere from one to dozens of different parents.

DEVELOPMENT AND AGING

A  single  tsochar  strand  is  only  a  small  portion  of  an  adult

tsochar. During their  rst four to eight weeks of life, individual

strands  in  the  same  area  encounter  each  other  and  slowly

self-organize,  joining  each  other  by  ones  and  twos  as  they

grow into tangles. These accumulating tangles begin to grow

together, fusing mouthparts, sharing blood vessels and nerve

connections, and gradually waking to full sentience about one

year after hatching.

Tsochari  are

virtually

immortal.

As strands

age and die, a

mature tsochar subsumes

newly  hatched  strands  to

replace  the  old.  Roughly  half  of  all

tsochari strands become incorporated

into mature adults in this fashion (the

other  half  assemble  new  individuals,

given  the  opportunity).  An  individual

Tsochari  grow  larger  as

they  grow  older,  adding

more  strands  than

they  lose.  The  more

strands a tsochar has,

the larger those strands tend to be. Very old tsochari might

consist of a hundred or more strands, some close to 20 feet

long and 3 inches thick.

Constrict  (Ex):  A  tsochar  strand  deals  1d33  points  of

damage with a successful grapple check. When a strand deals

damage by means of its grapple check, it injects its victim with

poison.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the tsochar strand

must hit a Small or smaller opponent with its tentacle attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,

it establishes a hold and can constrict. Tsochari receive a +4

racial bonus on grapple checks.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 11, initial and secondary

damage 1 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based. The tsochar

strands poison is delivered by dealing damage with its constrict

attack.

TSOCHAR VARIANTS

Roughly one in ten tsochari belong to the noble caste. These

creatures achieve a higher consciousness than the common

tsochar, and advance by character class in addition to grow-

ing larger as common tsochari do. A typical noble tsochar is

a tsochar of 8 Hit Dice, with four to eight sorcerer levels. The

largest  and  oldest  tsochari  are  terribly  powerful  sorcerers,

cruel and ancient entities that rule over their lesser fellows

with an iron grip.

Tsochari that are especially capable with their telepathy take

the Mindsight feat, described below.

Mindsight

A creature that has this feat possesses innate telepathic abil-

ity that allows it to precisely pinpoint other thinking beings

within range of its telepathy. The creature perceives where the

others are and how powerful their intellects are.

Prerequisite: Telepathy special quality.

Bene  t: A creature that has this feat can detect and pinpoint

beings that are not mindless (anything with an Intelligence

score of 1 or higher) within range of its telepathy. This works

much like blindsensethe creature knows what square each

thinking being is in, but it does not see the being, and the

being still has total concealment unless the creature can see

it by some other means.

The creature also perceives several observable characteristics

about  each  being  detected  with  mindsight,  including  the

beings type and Intelligence score. The creature need not take

any additional or special actions to gain this information; it is

as obvious to mindsight as the beings race and clothing would

be to eyesight.

Normal: Telepathy offers no special ability to sense other

minds. The creature has to know that a being is there to com-

municate with it telepathically.

TSOCHAR SOCIETY

Tsochari are spiteful, ambitious, avaricious, and self-centered.

They would likely entertain all sorts of murderous schemes

against one another, except for the fact that a tsochar is not well

equipped to in ict serious harm on one of its fellows. They cant

poison or inhabit each other, and their hard  esh is dif cult

to damage with their own natural weapons. Two tsochari can

 ght all day long and not do much harm to each other.

Since they are so resistant to each others physical attacks,

tsochari  naturally  limit  their  competitions  to  battles  of

intrigue, status, and prestige. Tsochar society is organized into

a number of rival castes, each constantly jockeying for power

and wealth. The  ve most important castes are the nobles, the

priests, the arcanists, the soldiers, and the merchants. Other

castes might have more members than these, but they rarely

interact with creatures of other races.

Nobles are the rulers of the tsochari, consisting of a merito-

cratic group of especially strong, old, cruel, and manipulative

individuals. No tsochar is favored by its birth position; the

creatures have no sense of family or hereditary posts. Instead,

any tsochar that demonstrates that it is capable, clever, and

ruthless can slowly worm its way into the ranks of the nobles.

High-ranking  individuals  in  other  castes  frequently  work

toward achieving enough status and wealth to abandon their

old castes and become nobles.

Priests belong to perhaps the most powerful caste. Tsochari

are fervently devoted to their sinister deities, and the cult of

Mak Thuum Ngatha is the single most in uential organiza-

tion within tsochari society. Even the nobles must pay heed

to the priests proclamations of divine will. Priests view the

plundering and sacri ce of otherworld races (such as humans)

as a holy mandate, and constantly seek to bring the worship

of the Nine-Tongued Worm to new spheres.

The arcanist tsochari assimilate and study stolen magical lore

from other races. All tsochari are fascinated by arcane magic,

but  the  arcanists  actually  take  levels  in  sorcerer  or  wizard

classes. Tsochari plots to subvert human wizards guilds arise

in the black halls of the arcanists.

Soldier tsochari serve the dictates of the leader castes. They

do the bidding of nobles, priests, and arcanists. Soldiers strive

to  ascend  to  nobility  through  useful  service,  demonstrated

successes, and a certain ruthless streak. The soldiers balance

the rivalry between noble and priest by following noble dictates

and priestly mandates as they deem advisable.

Tsochari merchants are not really merchants at all, since no

tsochari would offer payment for the things it desires unless no

other option is available. They work as far-ranging explorers,

raiders, slavers, and spies in search of opportunities to enrich

themselves at the expense of less-capable races.

LANGUAGE

Tsochari speak their own language, Tsochar. Much of it consists

of complex raspings and buzzings created by rubbing strands

together. While humanoids could conceivably learn to under-

stand tsochar speech, actually speaking the language would be

dif cult indeed. Because tsochari are telepathic, the Tsochar

language is relatively simple, with a broad vocabulary of tech-

nical terms and concepts but no syntax to speak of. It exists

primarily to serve as a written form of tsochar telepathy.

Tsochari rarely use the languages of other races, again rely-

ing  on  their  telepathy.  Typically,  a  tsochar  speaks  Tsochar,

Common, and one additional language useful in its dealings

with speci c races, such as Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, or

Undercommon. Tsochari understand these languages much

better  than  they  speak  them,  since  their  vocal  apparatus  is

nothing like a humanoid throat. When they do speak aloud in

humanoid languages, their voices are tinny and high-pitched,

and buzz abominably. A tsochar inhabiting or animating the

body of a humanoid is much more intelligible, since it can use

the existing vocal arrangements.

RELIGION

The tsochari are one of the most religious aberration races. The

cult of Mak Thuum Ngatha comprises an elite priestly caste

within tsochar society, even more powerful and in uential

than the noble caste. The Nine-Tongued Worm embodies

the opening of in nite knowledge, the destruction

of barriers, and the spanning of space and time, all

things that the tsochari deeply revere. In turn, Mak

Thuum Ngatha regards the tsochari as its favored

servants and agents (as much as it favors anyone

or anything), and entrusts tsochar priests with

tasks it deems important.

Since  Mak  Thuum  Ngatha  already  holds

sway  over  the  tsochari,  its  commands

to  its  priests  involve  spread-

ing  its  worship,  and  the

dark and perilous

Akhando and Xhekk

Thosss have Krusk in a

dif cult position

lore it brings, to other races and lands. All too often, this means

humanoid  realms  in  the  mundane  world.  Tsochari  priests

therefore serve as emissaries or messengers from the Nine-

Tongued Worm to humanoids foolish or reckless enough to be

tempted by the power the tsochari offer. More than one human

cultist has gained the services of tsochari spies and assassins

by promising to perform awful sacri ces and summonings at

the behest of tsochari priests.

Sample Characters: Akhando and Xhekk Thosss

(EL 10)

Last of a line of minor lords notorious for traf cking with

sinister powers, the cleric Akhando dwells in a dilapidated

tower in the dark, tangled forests of the Witch re Hills. Pass-

ing himself off as a reclusive landowner who rules over a small

 ef in this desolate area, Akhando is the secret master of a cult

devoted to Mak Thuum Ngatha. His shrines and summoning

stones lie scattered throughout the sinister forests of his

home. Akhando is currently hosting the tsochar priest

Xhekk Thosss, carrying the horrible

creature in his own  esh so that

his guest can study for itself the

possibilities  Akhandos

cult offers.

Constrict (Ex): Xhekk Thosss deals 2d4+6 points of damage

with a successful grapple check. When Xhekk Thosss deals

damage by means of its grapple check, it injects its victim with

poison.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Xhekk Thosss must

hit an opponent with two tentacle attacks. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can constrict. Tsochari receive a +4 racial bonus on

grapple checks.

Poison  (Ex): Injury,  Fortitude  DC  16,  initial  and  second-

Xhekk  Thosss  currently  inhabits  Akhandos  body  with  the

clerics willing cooperation. The tsochar priest can therefore

take  no  physical  actions  until  it  chooses  to  exit  Akhandos

body, as described under Wear Flesh (see page 122). It takes

half damage from all damage dealt to Akhando. The tsochar

attempts to keep its presence a secret, but if Akhando faces a

serious threat, the tsochar exits his body and joins the  ghta

horri c surprise for anyone unfortunate enough to witness

the scene.

Akhando seems human enough at a quick glance, although

he is quite pallid, and his eyes are feverish and intense. Beneath

his clothing, he is horribly abnormal. Two thick, strong, green

tentacles sprout from his hips, and the  esh of his left forearm

and hand is pocked with half a dozen small, gold-irised eyes

beneath thick lids. He is therefore careful to wear baggy tunics

LEADERS

Tsochari constantly  ght for status, looking for opportunities

to prove that they have the personal competence, ambition,

and  intelligence  to  merit  acceptance  in  the  noble  caste.  In

practice, merchants and soldiers most often advance in this

fashion. Arcanists care little for the schemes of their fellows

and  concentrate  on  amassing  magical  power,  while  priests

enjoy so much in uence and station that its more expedient

to advance within the priestly caste than to seek acceptance

as a minor noble.

Because the noble caste chooses new members from the

other castes, the nobles can count on at least a modicum of

loyalty  and  faithfulness  from  other  tsochari.  Angering  a

noble by failing to comply with its directives is a good way to

ensure that one will never be selected for that exalted class,

after all. Lower-caste tsochari that determine disobedience

is not likely to be noticed or punished frequently do as they

please, ignoring the orders of their superiors. The race would

doubtless  collapse  into  eternal  in ghting  and  warfare  if

not for two unifying factors: the racial hunger for arcane

magic,  and  the  racial  devotion  to  the  great  powers  of  the

Far Realm.

Within the noble ranks, age, personal power, and cunning

establish a pecking order of sorts. Newly elevated nobles seek

the patronage of older, more powerful tsochari, and work to

advance  their  elders  purposes.  High  nobles  can  command

the allegiance of some number of minor nobles. Great nobles

are rare indeed, each the satrap of a whole city or region. In

tsochari society, birth plays no role in achieving power; the

great nobles represent a circle of equals, each of whom holds

its position for centuries until some ambitious underling  nds

a way to unseat it.

TSOCHAR MAGIC

The tsochari are stealers of magic, and create little in the way

of unique spells or items.

TSOCHAR SPELLS

Tsochari design their few original spells to help them inhabit

other creatures.

By altering the essential nature of the matter composing your

body, you make yourself incorporeal for a brief time. While

incorporeal,  you  can  be  harmed  only  by  other  incorporeal

creatures,  magic  weapons,  and  spells,  spell-like  abilities,

or  supernatural  abilities.  Even  when  hit  by  spells  or  magic

weapons,  you  have  a  50%  chance  to  ignore  damage  from  a

corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy,

force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). You

can  enter  or  pass  through  solid  objects  as  described  under

the incorporeal subtype on page 310 of the Monster Manual.

Tsochar spellcasters sometimes use this spell to quickly exit an

inhabited creature without causing damage to the victim.

You cannot attack while in this state, but you can perform

other actions as your incorporeal nature allows.

Casting this spell is an immediate action. You can cast it

even  when  its  not  your  turn.  You  can  only  take  one  swift,

immediate, or quickened action per turn.

RELATIONS WITH OTHER RACES

Whispercast

The tsochari are contemptuous of most other forms of life. They

recognize other powerful aberrations as kindred of a sort, and

maintain cool relations with monsters such as neogi or mind

 ayers  if  conditions  permit.  While  tsochari  are  far-ranging

travelers with the ability and inclination to trade with other

elder races, they dislike the fact that many other aberration

races hold deities in little regard. Tsochari willingly ally with

cloakers, which share their goals.

Humanoids are little better than steeds, mounts to be used

and discarded at will. Humanoids exist to provide tsochari

with wealth, magic, and ready sacri ces to the glory of beings

such as Mak Thuum Ngatha. Tsochari look forward to the day

when they can launch a truly massive incursion, seizing the

bodies of high mages and great priests alike and establish-

ing themselves as the eternal and secret masters of enslaved

humanity.

normally, without you having to handle or manipulate it.

If you do not cast a second spell while whispercast is in effect,

you gain no bene t from casting whispercast.

Casting this spell is a swift action. It does not require a move

action  or  standard  action,  but  you  can  take  only  one  swift,

immediate, or quickened action per turn.

Tsochari spellcasters use this spell to permit spellcasting

while they inhabit other creatures. It is also useful for grappled

spellcasters.

TSOCHAR ITEMS

Tsochari use magic items differently than humanoids do. A

tsochar can wear:

Three amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts,

or scarabs secured around the small central body.

Three pairs of bracers or brace-

lets  on  the  thicker  motive

limbs near the central body.

Up to four rings on the slen-

der  ends  of  four  additional

tentacles  (one  ring  per  ten-

tacle).

Tsochari cannot wear headbands,

hats,  helmets,  phylacteries,

lenses, goggles, vests, vestments,

shirts,  robes,  suits  of  armor,

belts,  cloaks,  capes,  mantles,

gloves, gauntlets, boots, or shoes.

Tsochar arcanists design items

that  use  the  bracer  or  ring

slots.

Tsochari that grow too large

to  easily  inhabit  humanoids

sometimes make use of a ring of

reduction, described below.

Of  course,  a  tsochar  that

inhabits  or  replaces  another

creature  bene ts  from  magic

items that creature wears.

Ring of Reduction

On command, this ring reduces

the wearers size as described in

the  spell  reduce  person,  except

that any intelligent creature can

be affected, not just humanoids.

This reduces the wearer to the

next  smaller  size  category.  A

reduced creature gains a +2 size

bonus  to  Dexterity,  a  2  size

penalty to Strength, and the size

modi ers to attack rolls and Armor Class appropriate to its new

size. The wearer remains small until he removes the ring or

commands it to restore him to his proper size.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, reduce person,

permanency; Price 20,000 gp.

THE HOUSE OF

DEROS FRIST

The isolated tower of the wizard Deros Frist is an example of

a typical tsochari incursion into the human world. This short

adventure site describes the lair of a tsochar noble that has

successfully replaced Frist, a local wizard of some renown. The

tsochar Yikk Tasst now pores through the wizards libraries and

spellbooks, eagerly absorbing all the arcane lore it can.

This scenario works best when the player characters have

no reason to expect danger in Deros Frists home. Frist might

be  a  NPC  ally  of  the  party,  a

renowned  sage  whose  advice

the party is seeking, or a friend

of  a  trusted  NPC  mentor  or

patron who asks the party to

carry  a  minor  magic  item  to

his  house  as  a  favor.  A  typi-

cal  tsochar  adventure  should

focus on the dawning realiza-

tion that things are not as they

seem.

THE HOUSE

The  wizards  tower  stands  on

a  windswept  hilltop  above  a

sinister  and  tangled  forest  on

the lower slopes. A rutted road

breaks  out  of  the  oppressive

woods and winds across the sere

hillside  to  the  wizards  door.

Glimmers  of  dim  lanternlight

spill  out  of  the  narrow,  slitlike

windows.

There are two entrances to the

towerthe front door and the

kitchen  door.  The  front  door

is open, but the kitchen door

is  locked  (DC  25  Open  Lock

check).  The  tower  sits  atop  a

sturdy plinth of stone about 7

feet high, so the ground- oor

windowslits are actually about

10 feet above ground level, and

short  ights of stone stairs lead

up to the doors.

130

Deros Frists tower

1. FRONT HALL (EL 7)

The door opens into a modest foyer or hall, tastefully appointed

with paintings and wall hangings. Two doors exit the room to the

west, and a low, guttering  re burns in a stone  replace. Several

human guards wait here, dressed in purple cloaks.

The guards are actually human cultists, members of the Cult

of the Nine-Tongued Worm named Tilkos, Werra, and Zard.

Yikk Tasst summoned them to the house when it replaced

Deros Frist, and they now serve the tsochar as guards and

attendants.

The worm cultists are aware that Deros Frist has somehow

been transformed into a being that stands high in their cult,

and  they  suspect  a  tsochar  replacement.  They  play  along

with  the  masquerade,  pretending  that  everything  in  the

house is as it should be and passing themselves off as simple

swords-for-hire. Players asking after Deros Frist are told that

the master of the house is busy with his research, but if they

press, one cultist consents to go speak to Deros Frist to see

if he wishes to receive visitors. (Yikk Tasst is happy to come

downstairs and speak to the PCs, trusting in its disguise to

allay any suspicionsafter it prepares for a  ght by casting

a few spells  rst.)

Tilkos, Werra, and Zard do not attack unless it seems clear to

them that they can overwhelm the visitors, or that the visitors

are growing unduly suspicious of the situation.

2. DINING ROOM

A large table of well-polished wood  lls the center of this room,

surrounded by eight comfortable chairs. The remains of several

mealsroast  fowl,  boiled  potatoes,  and  what  seems  to  have

been a small goatstill lie scattered on the table.

The worm cultists are somewhat slovenly and havent bothered

to clean up after meals or wash dishes for several days. Yikk

Tasst sustains itself by slowly consuming Deros Frists body,

but it occasionally catches and eats small live animals.

3. LIBRARY

A wooden staircase leads upstairs from this small sitting room.

Wide bookshelves  ll one corner of the room, and a capacious

 replace with a few overstuffed armchairs in front of it stands

nearby. The bookshelves are in terrible disorder, with many tomes

lying discarded on the  oor.

Yikk Tasst has thoroughly ransacked the bookshelves,  nd-

ing little of particular interest. The discarded books include

genealogies, old adventuring journals, philosophies, histories,

and other such scholarly tomes.

About one hundred books remain in this room. Most would

be worth about 2d6 gp each to a dealer in a good-sized city,

but one tome (The Tale of the Golden Chalice) is not only a very

rare work of  ction but an outstanding example of a gorgeous

illuminated text, worth 350 gp.

4. KITCHEN

This room was clearly the tower kitchen. Countertops crowded

with dirty dishes and unscrubbed pots  ll the room, and a faint

odor of rotting food hangs in the air.

Deros Frist formerly maintained a small staff of  ve servants

and  attendants,  but  they  all   ed  the  house  soon  after  their

master  suddenly  and  severely  changed  personality.  The

servants are staying with kinfolk in nearby villages, wanting

nothing to do with the new Deros Frist.

The small room to the east is a pantry, where some foodstuffs

have been allowed to go bad due to the inattentiveness of the

houses new owner.

5. SECOND FLOOR LANDING

This area is unremarkable, except for the fact that the secret

trapdoor in the  oor of area 8 (the Masters Chamber) opens

up in the ceiling overhead. Noticing the trapdoor requires a

DC 30 Spot check by anyone simply passing through this hall,

but if someone searches the ceiling in this square, it requires

only a DC 10 Search check to discover.

6. GUEST ROOM (EL 6)

An odd, almost metallic, smell permeates this small bedchamber,

which has been ransacked. The bed lies on its side, furnishings are

strewn around the room, and a heavy blanket has been af xed

over the window slit to keep the room dark. One wall boasts a

large  replace, but it is currently cold.

Two normal tsochari have taken up residence in this room.

The  creatures  serve  Yikk  Tasst,  and  they  await  orders  from

their  leader  to  in ltrate  or  assassinate  nearby  spellcasters.

One  currently  lurks  behind  the  overturned  bed,  and  the

other hides in the spacious chimney of the  replace. The two

tsochari attack any creatures (other than the worm cultists or

other allies) that enter the room.

Tsochari (2): hp 32, 31; see page 121.

Both tsochari hunger for the opportunity to possess an

arcane spellcaster and take his spells, and naturally make

any such character their prime target. If pressed hard, the

tsochari seek to escape. They are good climbers, and as Small

creatures with  exible bodies, they can scramble up or down

the chimney to areas 4 or 8 with DC 15 Escape Artist checks

(their skill modi er is +4) or even slip out the windowslit

(DC 20).

7. SERVANTS QUARTERS

This small bunkroom has two double bunks, small trunks at the

foot of each bed, and looks relatively spartan.

The worm cultists Tilkos, Werra, and Zard use this room as

their personal quarters, since the previous occupantsDeros

Frists servantsabandoned this place. They keep odd hours,

but are most likely to be found here in the early morning.

One of the servants trunks now holds a small stash of wealth

belonging to Zard. The chest is locked (DC 25 Open Lock)

and protected with a poison needle trap (DC 20 Search; attack

bonus +6 melee; blue whinnis, DC 14, 1 Con/unconsciousness).

It contains a sack with 225 gp, 40 sp, two black pearls worth

200 gp each, and a scroll of wall of  re.

8. MASTERS CHAMBER

This large bedchamber features a  ne carpet, comfortable fur-

nishings,  a  bookcase  with  leaded  glass  doors,  and  a  big  stone

 replace, now empty. A large mirror in a gilded wooden frame

hangs on one wall.

This suite formerly belonged to Deros Frist. Yikk Tasst has

made little use of it since killing the wizard, because tsochari

need little rest, and because allowing their human hosts to

relax brings no comfort to tsochari. The prefer to drive their

hosts mercilessly.

The bookcase in this room has not been ransacked, because

Yikk  Tasst  learned  that  Deros  Frist  protected  it  with  a  few

dangerous magic traps. First, the bookcase is guarded by a  re

trap (DC 29 Search check, DC 29 Disable Device check, 1d4+8

points of  re damage, DC 18 Re ex save for half). Second, the

bookcase is guarded by a permanent mental alarm spell attuned

to warn Deros Frist if anyone opens the bookcase. (Of course,

since Frist is dead, the alarm spell no longer serves any pur-

pose.) Finally, if the bookcase is opened and a particular book

removed, a symbol of pain is revealed (DC 30 Search check, DC

30 Disable Device check). The book in question is a prominent

tome entitled Magic of the Dragon Lords, positioned face-out in

the center shelfeasily the  rst book anyone examining the

bookcase notices.

In the northwest corner of the room, below a corner of the

carpet, lies a concealed trapdoor allowing access to the landing

below on the second  oor (DC 20 Search check, or automatic

if anyone looks under the carpet). A simple rope ladder rests

coiled up in the foot-deep space between the two doors.

A  secret  compartment  above  the   replace  (DC  20

Search check) contains a small coffer  lled with 250

gp, 110 pp, a wand of magic missiles (caster level 5th),

and a scroll of teleport.

Several inconspicuous tomes on one shelf of the

bookcase are the spellbooks of a wizard whom Deros

Frist  defeated  several  years  ago.  The  spellbooks

include the following spells:

0acid  splash,  dancing  lights,  detect  magic,   are,

9. WIZARDS

WORKROOM (EL 10)

This room is a laboratory or work-

room of some sort. Against one

wall stands a table covered with

alchemical apparatusbeakers,

alembics, retorts, and similar devices. Smaller shelves on the

walls hold various arcane curiosities: rare reagents, glass jars

containing small preserved magical creatures such as brain

moles  and  hatchling  gricks,  and  skulls  of  different  types.

A  bookcase  on  another  wall  once  held  a  small  number  of

arcane tomes, maps, and scrolls, but all are now scattered on

the  oor.

Yikk Tasst, now in the body of Deros Frist, spends most of

its time in this workroom. Deros Frist was a 9th-level wizard

before the tsochar noble Yikk Tasst killed him and insinuated

itself into his corpse. The tsochar has used some of the spells

it took from Deros Frist, but still possesses the majority of the

spells the wizard had prepared when he was killed.

Yikk Tasst begins any encounter in the form of Deros Frist.

If the heroes are not overtly hostile, the tsochar continues the

masquerade as long as possible; it is a skillful liar and enjoys

deceiving people. It does its best to reassure visitors that all

is well, and waves off pointed questions about the state of the

tower, explaining that its new research permits little time to

tend to such matters.

If  matters  come  to  blows,  Yikk  Tasst   rst  makes

use of its own sorcerer spells, carefully hoard-

ing  Deros  Frists  taken  spells  as  long  as

possible. If things go badly, it abandons

Frists body (giving up its taken spells)

to gain full use of its formidable physi-

cal attacks. In a real pinch, Tasst ducks

into the closet to the south and

uses  the  secret  door  there  to

escape into the Conjury (area

10). From there, it can bolt down the

stairs or exit the building through

the secret door in that room.

A hidden drawer beneath the work-

table top (DC 15 Search check) holds

a leather pouch with 210 gp and a scroll

of  y. The bookshelf in this room holds

Deros Frists own spellbooks.

Constrict (Ex): Yikk Tasst deals 2d6+8 points of damage with

a successful grapple check. When Yikk Tasst deals damage by

means of its grapple check, it injects its victim with poison.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Yikk Tasst must hit

with two tentacle attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Tsochari receive a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks (included

in the statistics above).

Poison  (Ex): Injury,  Fortitude  DC  19,  initial  and

10. CONJURY

The  door  leading  into  this  room  from

the hall outside is locked (DC 25 Open

Lock check or DC 23 to break).

The  oor of this room is  nished in

smooth,  polished  marble.  In  the

center of the room, a pentagram

of  silver  is  inlaid  in  the   oor.  A

counter beside the door holds a

collection  of  ritual  implements,

including a knife of cold iron and

a golden goblet.

The  pentagram  is  ominous,

yet  harmlessnothing  has

been summoned here for some

time.

Yikk  Tasst,  like  Deros

Frist before it, considers

this  room  its  hidden

retreat  from  the  tower.

A  secret  door  in  the

eastern  wall  (Search

DC  20)  leads  to  the

closet  in  the  wizards

workroom,  area  9.  In

addition,  a  secret  door

in  the  south  wall  opens

into  the  middle  of  the  air  on

the towers exterior, 50 feet above

ground  level.  The  door  is  not  concealed

from inside the conjury, but it is well hidden from outside

observation (Search DC 25), and locked (Open Lock DC 30).

If Yikk Tasst is forced to  ee area 9, it tries to slip out this

aerial door and either climb down the tower (Climb DC 20)

or use a  y spell to make its escape.

he aberrations presented in the Monster Manual are

only the tip of the iceberg. Numerous varieties of

beholderkin, illithidlike creatures, and heretofore-

undiscovered aberrations also plague the world.

These monster descriptions provide psionics as spell-

like abilities described as psionics. If you would like to make

use of the rules from the Expanded Psionics Handbook, alterna-

tive psionic versions of the creatures powers are provided. Use

whichever version you prefer in your game (but dont use both

versions at the same time for the same monster).

BEHOLDERKIN

Most beholders are solitary monsters that regard others of

their kind as deadly enemies. Other beholders hold a differ-

ent point of view, gathering in terrible hivelike cities deep

underground.  Long  ago,  powerful  hive  mothers  and  elder

orbs sought to breed beholderkin slaves, others of their kind

that would acknowledge their rule and give them the ability

to destroy or conquer all other beholders. Creatures such as

directors and overseers were the result. In other places, hive

mothers altered their lesser fellows to perform specialized

tasks or to invade new environments, resulting in monsters

such as spectators and the dreadful eyes of the deep.

Combat

The primary weapons of all beholderkin are their deadly

eye rays.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of a beholderkins small eyes can

produce a magical ray once per round as a free action. The

number of eye rays that can be aimed at targets in any

90-degree arc varies with the species of beholderkin. A

beholderkin of any kind can tilt and pan its body each

round to change which rays it can bring to bear in any

given arc.

Each  eyes  effect  resembles  a  spell  (caster  level

varies with beholderkin variety), but follows the rules

for a ray (see Aiming a Spell, page 175 of the Players

Handbook).

All-Around Vision (Ex): Beholderkin are excep-

tionally alert and circumspect. Their many eyes give

them a +4 on Search and Spot checks, and they cant

be  anked.

This  massive  sphere-shaped  monstrosity  is  covered  with  spiny,

razor-sharp plates of chitin and bone. The creature has a cavern-

ous  maw   lled  with  multiple  rows  of  swordlike  teeth.  A  single

huge eye protrudes from above the mouth, and above this eye ten

smaller eyes, each recessed in a bony hood, are scattered across

the upper surface of the sphere in a radial pattern.

The hive mother is an extraordinarily (and thankfully) rare

creature  found  only  in  the  largest  beholder  communities.

Called ultimate tyrants, or simply ultimates, hive mothers

rule beholder communities with tyranny and cruelty, and are

mistakenly worshiped as deities by neighboring creatures of

other races.

A hive mother is larger than a typical beholder, measuring

about 12 feet across. The average hive mother weighs 15,000

pounds. As with other beholders, these creatures are asexual

and genderless. The name hive mother was given to these

monsters some time in the past by a misinformed (and now

eaten) adventurer, but the name seems to have stuck.

Hive  mothers  speak  Beholder  and  Common,  and  speak

numerous other local languages as well.

Hive  mothers  prefer  to  let  their  minions  do  the   ghting,

but when drawn into combat, they  ght in a manner similar

to beholders. Against smaller opponents that dont seem to

present a threat, a hive mother approaches to melee range to

eat its foes alive.

Command Beholder (Sp): A hive mother can use dominate

monster at will as a spell-like ability (caster level 20th), but only

against beholders and beholderkin. A beholder can resist this

effect with a successful DC 27 Will saving throw. This is the

equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Hive mothers are immune to the command beholder ability

of other hive mothers.

If a hive mother loses control of a dominated beholder (as

is the case if a dominated beholder is in the antimagic cone of

another beholder), the hive mother immediately senses the loss

of control, and knows the position and distance to the beholder

at the time control was lost. If control does not return within

a few rounds, the hive mother seeks out the rogue beholder

to investigate and possibly punish it.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of a hive mothers ten small eyes can

produce a magical ray once per round as a free action. Hive

mothers can rotate and adjust their position with much greater

speed and skill than normal beholders, and they can aim up

to six eye rays at targets in any given 90-degree arc.

Each eyes effect resembles a spell (caster level 20th). Each

ray has a range of 240 feet and a save DC of 27. The save DCs

are Charisma-based.

The ten eye rays include:

Charm Monster: The target must succeed on a Will save or

be affected as though by the spell.

Charm Person: The target must succeed on a Will save or be

affected as though by the spell.

Disintegrate: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or

be affected as though by the spell.

Fear:  This  works  like  the  spell,  except  that  it  targets  one

creature. The target must succeed on a Will save or be affected

as though by the spell.

Finger of Death: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save

or  be  slain  as  though  by  the  spell.  The  target  takes  3d6+20

points of damage if its saving throw succeeds.

Flesh to Stone: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save

or be affected as though by the spell.

In ict  Critical  Wounds:  This  works  like  the  spell,  causing

4d8+20 points of damage (Will save for half).

Sleep: This works like the spell, except that it affects one

creature with any number of Hit Dice (Will negates).

Slow:  This  works  like  the  spell,  except  that  it  affects  one

creature (Will negates).

Telekinesis:  A  hive  mother  can  move  objects  or  creatures

that weigh up to 375 pounds, as though with a telekinesis spell.

Creatures can resist the effect with a successful Will save.

must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A hive mother can try to swallow a

grabbed opponent that is at least two size categories smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check. Once swal-

lowed, the opponent takes 2d8+7 points of crushing damage

plus  2d8  points  of  acid  damage  per  round  from  the  hive

mothers gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by

using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 15 points of

damage to the gizzard (Armor Class 20). Once the creature

exits,  muscular  action  closes  the  hole;  another  swallowed

opponent  must  cut  its  own  way  out.  A  Huge  hive  mothers

gizzard can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8 Tiny, or 32 Diminutive

or smaller opponents.

Antimagic Cone (Su): A hive mothers central eye continu-

ally  produces  a  240-foot  cone  of  antimagic.  This  functions

just  like  antimagic   eld  (caster  level  20th).  All  magical  and

supernatural  powers  and  effects  within  the  cone  are  sup-

pressedeven  the  hive  mothers  own  eye  rays.  Once  each

round, during its turn, the hive mother decides whether the

antimagic cone is active or not (the hive mother deactivates

the cone by shutting its central eye).

Flight (Ex): A hive mothers body is naturally buoyant. This

buoyancy allows it to  y at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy

also grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

A directors eye rays have a range of 120 feet and a save DC

six eye rays include:

Burning Ray: The target takes 2d6 points of  re damage.

De  ection (Su): A directors central eye emits a strange,

invisible   eld  of  force  that  surrounds  the  creatures  body

and the body of its bonded vermin mount (if it has one). This

 eld grants both creatures a de ection bonus to their Armor

Class and a Re ex saving throw bonus equal to the directors

Charisma bonus.

Flight  (Ex):  A  directors  body  is  naturally  buoyant.  This

buoyancy allows it to  y at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy

also grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

Verminbond (Su): As a full-round action, a director can

attempt to dominate a creature of the vermin type that it hits

with a melee touch attack. The touched vermin can make a DC

18 Will save to negate this effect. This save DC is Charisma-

based. Normally, vermin are immune to mind-affecting spells

and abilities, but the directors verminbond ability overcomes

this immunity.

This effect is permanent, as long as the director remains in

physical contact with the vermin. Typically, a director uses

the vermin as a mount, using its tentacles to grip the vermin

just behind the head. Monstrous centipedes and scorpions are

favorite choices, but the director can control any vermin with

this ability.

While the verminbond is in effect, the director can control

the vermins actions by making successful Ride checks; bonded

vermin count as warhorses for the purpose of directing their

actions in combat.

As long as this effect remains, the bonded vermin gains the

bene ts of the directors de ection ability. More important,

both director and mount take half damage from all wounds

and attacks that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage

not taken by one creature is taken by the other.

Skills:  Directors  gain  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  all  Handle

Animal and Ride checks.

This  spherical  creature   oats  silently  in  the  murky  water.  Two

stalked eyes writhe atop the sphere, and two large arms ending

in crablike claws protrude from the spheres underside. Brightly

colored plates armor the sphere. A large eye stares from one side

of the sphere, above a mouth  lled with sharklike teeth. You can

see  ashes of light roiling deep within the eye.

An eye of the deep is an aquatic version of the more infamous

land-based  beholder.  These  monsters  dwell  in  the  deepest

reaches of the oceans, but rise to the surface to menace those

who dwell above the waves. These hateful and cruel creatures

are fond of creating illusions of shipwreck survivors, small

islands,  mermaids,  or  whatever  else  they  think  might  lure

their victims closer. Some eyes of the deep can be found in

relatively shallow waterways far underground.

Eyes of the deep are about 9 feet in diameter and weigh 6,000

pounds. They speak Common, Beholder, and Aquan.

Combat

An eye of the deep uses its baleful  ash ability and eye rays

to hinder foes at range so it can swim up close and tear them

apart with its massive claws.

Baleful Flash (Su): As a free action, an eye of the deep can

generate a  ash of terrible white light from its central eye once

per round. This  ash affects all creatures in a 60-foot cone.

The baleful  ash blinds creatures for 2d6 rounds and stuns

them for half the duration of the blindness. A DC 22 Fortitude

save negates the stun and reduces the blindness to dazzled.

Sightless creatures are immune to this attack. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Constrict (Ex): An eye of the deep deals 2d6+5 points of

damage with a successful grapple check.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of an eye of the deeps two small eyes

can produce a magical ray once per round as a free action. Each

ray has a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 18 (caster level 12th).

The save DCs are Charisma-based. The two eye rays include:

Hold Monster: The target must succeed on a Will save or be

affected as though by the spell.

Cone of Cold: This works like the spell, but affects only the

creature touched by the ray (Re ex save for half).

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  an  eye  of  the

deep  must  hit  with  its  claw  attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold

and can constrict.

Persistent Image (Sp): As a standard action, an eye of the

deep can create a persistent image (as the spell at caster level

12th). The eye of the deep cannot use its eye rays

in the same round that it casts persistent image.

This  creature  resembles  a  black,  rubbery  tree  of  undulant   esh.

Thick, matted sheets of wiry fungus grow all over its surface. The

fanged maws gurgle lower on the trees trunk, and it supports

itself with a thick, coiling mass of eight long tentacles.

Overseers  serve  hive  mothers  as  subordinates  in

large  beholder  communities,  similar  to  the  way

humanoid  rulers  employ  others  as  guards  or

governors. The rare overseer that does not belong

to a beholder community seeks out societies of other

creatures to in ltrate and dominate from behind the

scenes.  An  overseer  is  uncomfortable  without  a  large

number  of  subservient  minions  to  tend  to  its  real  (or

imagined) needs.

An  overseer  is  normally  about  15  feet  tall  and

weighs  4,000  pounds.  They  speak  Beholder  and

Common.

Combat

Overseer

Unlike  most  other  beholderkin,  overseers

have a large number of physi-

cal  attacks  that  they  can

use  in  melee  combat  to

great  effect.  Neverthe-

less,  they  prefer  to

let  their  minions

handle such crude

activities  as  melee

combat,  and  con-

centrate  on  using  their

eye rays against

enemies. An

weakness is its lack of mobility; when faced with a foe that

uses greater mobility to stay out of range of its eye rays, an

overseer typically retreats to plot revenge on its own terms.

Most overseers keep at least one magic item that allows some

form of teleportation handy for just such an event.

Command Beholder (Sp): An overseer can use dominate

monster at will as a spell-like ability (caster level 14th), but only

against beholders and beholderkin (except for hive mothers

and other overseers). A beholder can resist this effect with a

DC 23 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based. This

is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

The maximum number of beholders an overseer can com-

mand at one time equals its Hit Dice plus its Charisma modi er.

Thus, the average overseer can command up to 20 beholders

or beholderkin at a time.

If an overseer loses control of a dominated beholder (as is

the case if a dominated beholder is in the antimagic cone of

another beholder), the overseer can immediately sense the loss

of control and knows the position and distance to the beholder

at the time control was lost. If control does not return within

a  few  rounds,  the  overseer  seeks  out  the  rogue  beholder  to

investigate and possibly punish it.

Constrict (Ex): An overseer deals 1d6+6 points of damage

with a successful grapple check.

Eye Rays (Su): Each of a directors thirteen small eyes can

produce a magical ray once per round as a free action (except

for its major creation eye ray; see below). An overseers long

branches allow it to aim up to  ve eye rays at targets in any

given 90-degree arc. It typically attacks with only four rays in

any round, leaving it with the option to use its reactive spell

turning or reactive spell immunity eye ray as needed.

Each ray has a range of 180 feet, a save DC of 23, and a caster

level of 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. The thirteen

eye rays include:

Chain Lightning: This works like the spell, except that if the

eye ray misses the initial target, the effect is wasted. Only if the

initial target is hit does the lightning arc to other targets.

Crushing Despair: This works like the spell, except that it

affects only a single target (Will save negates).

Dominate Person: The target must succeed on a Will save or

that cast the spell in question; if successful, it is immune to

that casting of that particular spell. If the spell affects mul-

tiple targets or an area, it affects any other targets or the area

normally, but the overseer remains immune to its effect. An

overseer cannot use this eye ray if it is considered  at-footed

against the source of the spell.

Reactive Spell Turning: Once per round, this eye can be used

to re ect a single-target spell that targets the overseer back to

its source as an eye ray. The overseer must hit the source with

the eye ray; otherwise, the re ected spell dissipates harmlessly.

An overseer cannot use this eye ray if it is considered  at-footed

against the source of the spell.

Stunning: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or be

stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Suggestion:  The  target  must  succeed  on  a  Will  save  or  be

affected as though by the spell.

Telekinesis: An overseer can move objects or creatures that

weigh  up  to  350  pounds,  as  though  with  a  telekinesis  spell.

Creatures can resist the effect with a successful Will save.

Temporal Stasis: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save

or be affected as though by the spell.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an overseer must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can

constrict.

Fungus (Ex): An overseers protective layer of thick, wiry

fungus provides a +6 armor bonus to its Armor Class. This

fungus  doesnt  impede  or  restrict  the  overseers  movement

in any way. The fungus reacts to the overseers moods, and

changes color as the beholderkins emotions change.

This  spherical  creatures  leathery  body  is  crowned  with  four

slender  eyestalks,  each  terminating  in  a  small

lidless eye. A  fth eye, much larger than these,

is  located  on  the  front  of  the  sphere,  above  a

toothy maw.

Spectators are the most moderate and calm of

the beholderkin. Native to the Clock-

work Nirvana of Mechanus, these

extraplanar  beholderkin  are

encountered  on  the  Material

Plane as guardians. Spectators

have  been  known  to  spend

decades contemplating philo-

sophical  and  theological  questions,  and

engage  adventurers  and  explorers  in  such

conversations when they are encountered.

They rarely attack others on sight,

and  they  prefer  to   ee  from

attacks by powerful creatures.

Spectators are about 3 feet in

diameter and weigh about

250  pounds.  They  speak

Beholder and Common.

Combat

Although  a  spec-

tator  prefers  to  avoid

combat entirely, it is by

no means defenseless. If

forced to  ght or defend

an object it is guarding, it

is capable of in icting great harm with its eye rays.

Eye  Rays  (Su):  Each  of  a  spectators  four  small  eyes  can

produce a magical ray once per round as a free action. During

a single round, it can aim only one eye ray at targets in any one

90-degree arc (up, forward, backward, left, right, or down). Each

ray has a range of 60 feet and a save DC of 14 (caster level 6th).

The save DCs are Charisma-based. The four eye rays include:

Fatigue: The target must make a Fortitude save or become

fatigued. A fatigued creature that fails to save against this effect

becomes exhausted.

In ict Moderate Wounds: This ray works like the spell, causing

2d8+6 points of damage (Will half).

Hold Monster: The target must succeed on a Will save or be

affected as though by the spell.

Telepathy: A spectator can communicate telepathically with

its target for the round. As a free action, a spectator can make

a suggestion  (as  the  spell;  Will  negates)  to  any  creature  it  is

currently telepathically speaking to.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  3/daycreate  food  and  water;  1/

dayplane shift (DC 17). Caster level 6th. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

Flight (Ex): A spectators body is naturally buoyant. This

buoyancy allows it to  y at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy

also grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

Planar Fast Healing (Ex): While on Mecha-

nus, a spectator has fast healing 3.

Spell Turning (Su): A spectators

central  eye  produces  a  90-foot  cone  that

re ects  any  spell  cast  upon  it  by  a

creature within the cone back upon

its source. This functions just like

spell turning (caster level 6th). Up

to  one  spell  can  be  re ected  per

round.

Cildabrins are subterranean hunters that prefer temperate or

warm  underground  regions.  Incapable  of  spinning  normal

webs, cildabrins roam their territory like great wolves, look-

ing for any prey they can catch and tear to shreds with their

powerful pincers. Once they catch their food, it is poisoned

into submission or killed. The cildabrin then retreats to its

laira warm, dark caveto eat at its leisure. It devours its

prey like a scorpion rather than a spider; its pincers tear

off shreds of  esh small enough for the creature to chew

with its mandibles. A cildabrin has no interest in any gear

or valuables its prey carries, beyond the possibility that

scattering such items around its territory might attract

more prey.

Sages speculate that cildabrins might be a created

race,  not  one  that  evolved  naturally.  Those  who

espouse  this  theory  point  to  the  aberrations

remarkable similarities to two other natural

kinds  of  arachnid  creatures:  hunting

spiders (such as tarantulas) and scorpi-

ons. Cildabrins seem incapable of true

speech  but  can  communicate  with

other  arachnids.  They  are  sentient;

they merely lack the means to vocalize

sounds.

When  roaming  underground,  cildabrins

sometimes stray perilously close to dungeons,

sewers, crypts, and other subterranean elements

of civilization. Despite legends to the contrary, it does

not seem that cildabrins are tools of the drow. The dark elves

fear these terrible beasts at least as much as other humanoids

do. In fact, some religious sects among the drow consider the

appearance of a cildabrin to be a dire omen. For their own part,

these aberrations seem to prefer dwarf  esh above all else.

COMBAT

As  a  solitary  hunter,  a  cildabrin  prefers  to  stalk  its  prey.  It

slowly closes the distance to the quarry after using its spell-like

silence ability, and then leaps to the attack. If hunting a lone

 gure or a small group, a cildabrin remains in melee, trying

to kill or incapacitate as many targets as possible. If engaging

a large or powerful group of prey, a cildabrin uses its Spring

Attack feat to snatch up one or two targets, tries to trap any

remaining  foes  in  its  spike  stones,  casts  darkness  to  cover  its

escape,  and  then   ees  to  kill  and  consume  its  prey  later  in

safety. Its long claws and segmented, scorpionlike tail give it

exceptional reach in combat.

Constrict (Ex): A cildabrin deals an extra 1d6+10 points of

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a cildabrin must

successfully attack with a pincer. It can then attempt to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, the cildabrin establishes

a hold and deals constrict damage. Cildabrins gain a +4 racial

bonus on grapple checks.

A cildabrin might choose to grapple with one pincer only

(grapple  bonus  +3),  especially  against  Small  opponents  or

opponents that have been weakened by its poison. This tactic

leaves the monster free to move or use its other attacks against

different opponents.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary

A shadowcloak elder is a cloaker advanced to 10 Hit Dice

(size  Huge),  with  the  shadow  creature  template  and  seven

sorcerer levels.

COMBAT

Shadowcloak  elders  are  clever  and  resourceful  opponents

with numerous strange abilities. They coordinate the efforts

of their cloaker followers, so that some cloakers constantly

and  disori-

moan  while  others  attack  the  weakened

out  of  melee

ented prey. A shadowcloak elder hovers

its own spells

range to attack enemy spellcasters with

grisly  work,

while  its  minions  do  their

blend  power

counting  on  its  shadow

to  stay  out  of

sight.

If  confront-

ed  by  a  dangerous

spellcaster,  a  shadow-

cloak  elder  might

swoop  in  and  en-

gulf  the  enemy,

hoping to smoth-

er the offending

caster with one

bold stroke.

Engulf (Ex):

A  shadowcloak

elder  can  try

to wrap a Large

or  smaller  crea-

ture in its body as

a  standard  action.

The  shadowcloak  el-

der attempts to initiate

a grapple that does not pro-

voke  attacks  of  opportunity.

If it wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold and makes an imme-

diate bite attack against the engulfed victim

with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still

A great, menacing shadow hovers in the air, with hate-

ful  red  eyes  and  a  crooked  maw  full  of  needlesharp

fangs. Its raylike body ripples in shades of black, gray, and pallid

white, and it has a long, lashing whip of a tail.

Shadowcloak elder

Deep underground, cloakers build citylike nests of swooping

shadows and crawling darkness. The secret rulers of these dark

cities  lurk  behind  the  perceived  leadersthe  shadowcloak

elders,  cloakers  of  great  size  and  power,  tainted  with  the

substance of shadow and skilled in dark sorcery. Sinister and

inscrutable,  shadowcloak  elders  occasionally  emerge  from

secrecy to lead their lesser fellows in raids and patrols of the

nearby territory, in search of slaves and food.

An  average  shadowcloak  elder  has  a  wingspan  of  12

feet  and  weighs  400  pounds.  Shadowcloak  elders  speak

Undercommon.

use its whiplike tail to strike at other targets.

Attacks that hit an engul ng shadowcloak elder deal half

damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.

Moan  (Ex):  A  shadowcloak  elder  can  emit  a  dangerous

subsonic moan (a sonic, mind-affecting ability) as a standard

action. By changing the frequency, a shadowcloak elder can

create one of four effects, which are described below. Shad-

owcloak elders are immune to the moans of other cloakers.

Unless otherwise speci ed, a creature that successfully saves

against one of these effects cannot be affected by the same

moan effect from the same cloaker for 24 hours. All save DCs

for moan effects are Charisma-based.

Unnerve: Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes

a 2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear

the moan for more than 6 consecutive rounds must succeed on

Here lies a great,  brous mass of fused brain tissue, covered in

writhing tendrils. It pulsates and glows like an ember, releasing

visible  ares of psychic power.

An  elder  brain  is  the  ultimate  stage  of  the  mind   ayer  life

cycle. A malevolent being of godlike intellect, an elder brain

serves as the center of any mind  ayer city, guiding its host

community toward the ful llment of its dark dreams of illithid

dominion.

An elder brain spends most of its existence  oating within

the depths of a briny pool in a protected cavern at the heart of a

mind  ayer city. Its visible psychic energy is a side effect of the

power that allows it to remain active long after the bodily deaths

of the individual mind  ayers whose brains compose its form.

An elder brain can speak telepathically with any creature

within 350 feet that has a language (see Telepathic Awareness,

below).

Base Attack/Grapple: +19/+24

Attack: Tendril +20 melee (1d6+1 plus extract)

An elder brain uses its quickened spell-like abilities in the same

round that it makes melee attacks with its tendrils, if possible.

It begins a combat against multiple foes with a mind blast.

Extract  (Ex):  An  elder  brain  that  begins  its  turn  with

a  tendril  attached  to  an  opponent  and  makes  a  successful

grapple  check  automatically  extracts  the  opponents  brain,

instantly killing that creature. This power is useless against

constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. Extraction

is not instantly fatal to foes with multiple heads.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  an  elder  brain

must hit a Small to Gargantuan creature with its tendril attack.

If it gets a hold, it sinks the tendril into the opponents head

The opponent can escape with a single

a +2 circumstance bonus for the deep

1d6 points of damage from ripping the

tendril free.

Mind Blast (Sp): This psionic attack is

a cone 60 feet long. Anyone caught in this

cone must succeed on a DC 31 Will save

or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. An elder

brain can use this ability once every 1d4

Within this same range, it can communicate with any creature

that has a language.

ELDER BRAIN SOCIETY

An elder brain is the physical and spiritual center of its illithid

community. It serves as a living repository of the communitys

technology, history, and psionic expertise, as well as its advisor

(or more often, as its de facto leader).

It  is  the  right  and  obligation  of  every  illithid  to  merge

with the elder brain when its natural life span nears its end.

Though most illithids hope otherwise, their sacri ce is com-

pletetheir egos are subsumed, and their gray matter serves

only to revitalize the elder brain.

An elder brain preys upon the thousands of illithid tadpoles

that share its briny pool. The tadpoles that survive are deemed

strong enough to be used to create true illithids.

ELDER EIDOLON

The art of crafting magical constructs to serve as guardians

has existed for eons. It was an old practice when the humanoid

races  took  their   rst  tentative  steps  toward  the  mastery  of

magic, and today, most constructs that exist are based on the

humanoid form. Yet constructs from previous epochs still exist

in the darkest, most secluded regions of the world. Known

collectively  as  elder  eidolons,  these  ageless  creatures  guard

sites that have long since been abandoned, the races that built

them having faded into obscurity. Eidolons are all that remain

of these ancient races, and from their form one can surmise

that the world is better off without them.

An elder eidolon is built of ancient rock, basalt, porphyry,

obsidian, or other igneous stone. Its surface is covered with

ancient runes or glyphs from forgotten, dead languages. While

the features of an eidolon might appear somewhat eroded or

timeworn, the creatures remain quite sturdy and

dangerous.  Eidolons  are  mindless,  and  do  only

what they are ordered to do by their cre-

ators. The process for creating eidolons

has  long  since  passed  into  antiquity,

so eidolons that still exist are without

masters.  They  contin-

ue to perform their

prior tasks, relent-

less and eternal in

their  obedience.

This  huge  statue  of  black,  glossy  stone  resembles  an  immense

squid  with  two  staring  eyes  and  a  mass  of  tentacles.  Its  body

shimmers and wavers, almost as if its not quite all there.

Combat

An eidolon kraken strikes opponents with its barbed tentacles,

then grabs and crushes them with its arms or drags victims into

its huge jaws. An opponent can make sunder attempts against

an eidolon krakens tentacles or arms as if they were weapons.

An eidolon krakens tentacles have 20 hit points, and its arms

have 10 hit points. If its grappling a target with one tentacle

or arm, it uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity

against the sunder attempt. Severing a tentacle or arm deals

damage to the eidolon equal to half the limbs full normal hit

points; this damage bypasses the creatures damage reduction.

Since an eidolon kraken has fast repair, any damage done to

a tentacle or arm repairs at the rate of 5 hit points per round.

Severed tentacles or arms regrow in 1d10+10 days.

Constrict (Ex): An eidolon kraken deals 1d6+24 (arm) or

2d8+24 (tentacle) points of damage with a successful grapple

check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an eidolon kraken

must hit a creature with a tentacle or arm attack. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a

hold and immediately deals constrict damage.

Insanity  Aura  (Su):  Any  living  creature  within  10  feet

of an eidolon kraken must make a DC 20 Will saving throw

each round or become confused for 1 round. The save DC is

Wisdom-based.

Fast  Repair  (Ex):  An  eidolon  kraken  repairs  damage  to

itself at a rate of 5 hit points per round as long as it is above 0

hit points.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): An eidolon kraken is immune

to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In

addition, certain spells and effects function differently against

the creature, as noted below.

Etherealness immediately repairs damage to an eidolon equal

to the spells caster level. Dimensional anchor causes an eidolon

to cease functioning for 1 round (treat as if dazed). Dimensional

lock  does  not  interfere  with  an  eidolons  operation,  but  an

eidolon that enters the area of a dimensional lock spell or similar

effect loses the bene ts of its otherworldly geometry and its

insanity aura.

A transmute rock to mud spell slows an eidolon (as the slow

spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while transmute

mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points.

A stone to  esh spell does not actually change an eidolons

structure, but negates its damage reduction and immunity to

magic for 1 round.

Otherworldly Geometry (Su): An eidolon krakens form

incorporates  what  should  be  impossible  geometrics.  This

grants it a +4 de ection bonus to its Armor Class.

CREATING AN ELDER EIDOLON

Elder  eidolon  is  an  inherited  template  that  can  be  added

to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical

beast, monstrous humanoid, plant, or vermin. An eidolon uses

all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except as

noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to construct. It

loses all subtypes and does not gain the augmented subtype. It

uses all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except

as noted here. Recalculate base attack bonus, saving throws,

feats, and skills as described below.

Hit Dice: Drop any Hit Dice gained from class levels (to

a minimum of 1 Hit Die) and change remaining Hit Dice to

d10s. As a construct, the creature loses any bonus hit points

for a high Constitution, but gains bonus hit points based on

its size, as shown below:

Armor Class, since its form does not wholly exist in the Mate-

rial Plane. See Otherworldly Geometry, below.

Base Attack: The creatures base attack bonus changes to

its Hit Dice  3/4, as a cleric.

Attack:  An  elder  eidolon  retains  all  the  natural  attacks,

manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon pro ciencies of

the base creature. An eidolon based on a creature that has no

natural attacks gains a slam attack as shown below, which it

can use in place of a manufactured weapon attack. (An eidolon

with two slams can wield a weapon in one hand and make a

slam attack with its off-hand at a 5 penalty, adding half its Str

bonus to the damage roll).

Special Attacks: An elder eidolon loses all of the super-

natural special attacks, spell-like abilities, and extraordinary

special attacks allowing a saving throw based on Constitution.

It retains extraordinary special attacks that do not permit a

saving throw (such as rake, rend, or constrict) or that allow a

saving throw based on Strength (such as trample). In addition,

an eidolon gains the following special attack:

Insanity Aura (Su): The elemental forces that power an elder

eidolon warp time and space and cause horrible hallucinations

147

in those nearby. Any living creature within 10 feet of an eido-

lon must make a successful Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2

the eidolons Hit Dice + Wis modi er) each round or become

confused for 1 round.

Special Qualities: An elder eidolon loses all special quali-

ties of the base creature, but gains the special qualities listed

below.

Construct Traits: An eidolon has immunity to poison, sleep

effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy

effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, compul-

sions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect

that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects

or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical

hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue,

exhaustion,  or  energy  drain.  It  cannot  heal  damage,  but  it

can be repaired. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light

vision.

or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition,

certain  spells  and  effects  function  differently  against  the

creature, as noted below.

A transmute rock to mud spell slows an eidolon (as the slow

A stone to  esh spell does not actually change an eidolons

structure, but negates its damage reduction and immunity to

magic for 1 round.

Otherworldly Geometry (Su): An eidolons form incorporates

what should be impossible geometrics. This warping of planar

realities around an elder eidolon grants it a +4 de ection bonus

to its Armor Class.

Saves: Recalculate an eidolons saving throws. The eidolons

base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 Hit Dice, Ref +1/3 Hit Dice,

and Will +1/3 Hit Dice.

Abilities:  Modify  the  base  creatures  ability  scores  as

follows: Strength +8, Dexterity +4. An eidolon has no Constitu-

tion or Intelligence score. Change its Wisdom score to 11, and

its Charisma score to 1.

Skills and Feats: An eidolon loses all skill points and feats,

except feats that improve its attacks, such as Improved Natural

CONSTRUCTING AN ELDER EIDOLON

Although the technique to build eidolons is ancient and, for

all practical purposes, lost to time, rules for creating them are

presented here. Discovering the secrets of creating eidolons

could form the core of a high-level adventure.

The eidolons creator must have the Craft Construct feat.

The eidolons body must be built from stone, and requires a

DC 25 Craft (sculpting or stonemasonry) check. Knowledge

(architecture and engineering) can be substituted for the Craft

skill when building an eidolon. The cost of the eidolons body

depends on its size:

2,000 gp

5,000 gp

10,000 gp

25,000 gp

50,000 gp

The market price is 6,000 gp per Hit Die of the eidolon, plus

the cost of its body. The cost to create is 3,000 gp and 240 XP

per Hit Die, plus the cost of the body. The minimum caster

level to create an eidolon is equal to its Hit Dice.

For example, a Gargantuan eidolon with 20 Hit Dice has a

market price of 145,000 gp and requires 4,800 XP to create.

The cost to create is 85,000 gp, and the caster must be at least

20th level.

A bulbous body  oats toward you. It has a central,

unblinking  eye,  and  a  large  maw   lled

with  daggerlike  teeth.  Smaller  eyes,

attached  to  wriggling  stalks,

sprout from the top of the orb-

like body.

The gas spore is a highly

specialized form of plant

life  originally  created  by

ancient beholder mages. Since

then, these proli c creatures

have spread far and wide.

While  a  gas  spore

resembles a beholder

in appearance, it is

in  fact  a  form

of  fungus.

The creature

is hollow,  lled with a

large volume of spores

under terri c pressure.

A  gas  spore  is  typically  about  8  feet

across but weighs only 50 pounds.

Infestation  (Ex):  Any  living  nonplant  creature  that  is

damaged by a gas spores slam attack or its death throes must

immediately succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or become

infested with spores. An infested creature takes 1d4 points

of  Constitution  damage  upon  becoming  infested  and  an

additional 1d4 points of Constitution damage every hour that

follows as the spores rapidly grow and consume  esh. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

These spores are similar to poison, and anything

that delays, neutralizes, or prevents poisoning

has a similar effect on the spores. Creatures

immune to extra damage from critical hits

or  immune  to  poison  are

immune  to  a  gas  spores

infestation.

When the victims Con-

dissolves into a formless mush

that transforms into 1d4 Small

gas  spores  over  the  course

of  1  minute.  Each  Small  gas

spore has 1 Hit Die. These gas spores

grow rapidly, gaining 1 Hit Die per

minute  until  they  reach  their

maximum size (10 Hit Dice).

Beholders,  beholderkin,  and

creatures  with  beholder  grafts

are immune to gas spore infesta-

tion,  and  gas  spores  know

intrinsically  to  ignore

such creatures.

All-Around

Vision (Ex): A gas spore

can  see  in  all  directions  at  once.

Because of this, it gains a +4 racial bonus

Gas spore

COMBAT

Gas spores are mindless, but far from harmless. When they

sense  a  nearby  creature,  they  immediately  approach  and

attempt to infest the creature with spores. A gas spore attacks

by slamming into a creature with its body. Upon contacting a

target, thousands of tiny  laments lash at the creatures  esh

and infest it with spores. As mindless creatures, gas spores

pursue  their  selected  target  relentlessly  until  slain  or  until

the target escapes beyond their range of sight. Even then, a

gas spore continues to drift lazily in the direction it last saw

its target.

Death Throes (Ex): A gas spore reduced to 0 or fewer hit

points immediately explodes in a powerful burst of spores and

foul-smelling gas. This blast affects all creatures in a 10-foot

radius, dealing them 6d6 points of sonic damage and exposing

them to the spores (see Infestation, below). A DC 10 Re ex save

halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. The

spores are dispersed in this explosion and cannot be harvested

thereafter.

on Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be  anked.

Beholder Camou  age (Ex): A gas spores appearance is so

clever that it gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks to

appear as a beholder.

Flight (Ex): A gas spores body is naturally buoyant. This

buoyancy allows it to  y at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy

also grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

HARVESTING GAS SPORES

A typical gas spore yields 1d4 doses of usable gas spore powder

with  a  DC  20  Craft  (alchemy)  check;  failure  by  5  or  more

results in the gas spores explosion and the destruction of its

supply of spores (and possible infestation of the harvester).

Gas spore powder is a dangerous poison that costs 500 gp per

dose. Anyone who dies of this poison quickly deteriorates into

1d4 Small gas spores as detailed above under the creatures

infestation attack.

Poison (Ex): Contact, Fortitude DC 12, initial and secondary

damage 1d4 Con.

This  unwholesome  creature  has  a  body

with  the  form  and   uidity  of  an  amoeba.

Its surface has the color, but not the consistency, of human  esh.

Countless  eyes  and  toothy  mouths  constantly  form  and  disap-

pear all over the creature, retreating into its body even as they

become apparent.

Gibbering mouther

A gibbering mouther is a creature seemingly drawn from a

lunatics nightmares. Although not evil, it thirsts after bodily

 uids and seems to prefer the blood of intelligent creatures.

Sometimes the arrangement of eyes and mouths on a gibbering

mouthers body resembles a face, but just as often the features

have no relationship to one another.

A gibbering mouther is about 3 feet across and 3 to 4 feet

high. It weighs about 200 pounds.

Gibbering mouthers can speak Common, but seldom say

anything other than gibberish.

150

COMBAT

A gibbering mouther attacks by shooting out strings of pro-

toplasmic  esh, each ending in one or more eyes and a mouth

that bites at the enemy. A mouther can send out a total of six

such members in any round.

Blood Drain (Ex): A swallowed opponent automatically

takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round.

Gibbering  (Su):  As  soon  as  a  mouther  spots  something

edible,  it  begins  a  constant  gibbering  as  a  free  action.  All

creatures (other than mouthers) within a 60-foot spread must

succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as though by a

confusion spell for 1d2 rounds. This is a sonic mind-

affecting  compulsion  effect.  A  creature  that

successfully saves cannot be affected by the

same gibbering mouthers gibbering for

24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-

based.

Ground  Manipulation

(Su):  At  will,  as  a  standard

action, a gibbering mouther

can cause stone and earth

in all adjacent squares to

become  a  morass  akin

to  quicksand.  Soften-

ing earth, sand, or the

like  takes  1  round,

while  stone  takes

2 rounds. Anyone

other  than  the

mouther  in  that

area  must  take  a

move-equivalent

action  to  avoid

becoming  mired

as  being

(treat

pinned).

Improved  Grab

(Ex): To use this ability,

a gibbering mouther must hit

a Medium or smaller foe with a bite attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity.

Spittle  (Ex):  As  a  free  action  every  round,  a  gibbering

mouther can  re a stream of spittle at one opponent within

30 feet. The mouther makes a ranged touch attack; if it hits, it

deals 1d4 points of acid damage, and the target must succeed

on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Eyeless

creatures are immune to the blinding effect but are still subject

to the acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A gibbering mouther can attempt

to swallow a grappled opponent of Medium or smaller size by

making a successful grapple check. (The gibbering mouther

doesnt actually swallow the opponentit engulfs the victim

within its amorphous formbut the effect is essentially the

same.) Once the victim is inside, the gibbering mouther can

use its blood drain ability. A swallowed creature can cut its way

out by dealing 5 points of damage to the gibbering mouther

(AC 19). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the

hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out.

A gibbering mouthers body can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8

Tiny, 32 Diminutive, or 128 Fine creatures.

Amorphous (Ex): A gibbering mouther is not subject to

extra damage from critical hits. It cannot be  anked.

Skills: Thanks to their multiple eyes, gibbering mouthers

have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks. A gibbering mouther

has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some

special action or avoid a hazard. It always can choose to take

10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action

while  swimming,  provided  it

swims in a straight line.

Note:  The  gibbering

mouther   rst  appeared  in

the Monster Manual. This

version  incorporates  er-

rata  to  that  creature  and

should be considered the of-

 cial version.

HALF-

FARSPAWN

Much as  ends produce ter-

rible mortal progeny, certain

entities  of  the  Far  Realm

occasionally  venture  to

the  Material  Plane  to

procreate. Sometimes the

mortal  parent  is  will-

ing, a  fanatical  cultist or

creature so debased in evil

that  he  or  she  deliberately

invites  the  union.  Other  times,

the Far Realm being visits its horrible

taint on whatever mortal creature best suits

its  abhorrent  purpose.  In  any  event,  the  half-farspawn  is  a

creature in which the fantastically abnormal is cloaked in a

guise of mundane  esh and blood.

Half-farspawn  are  horrible  in  appearance.  By  the  capri-

ciousness  of  fate  and  heritage,  they  might  appear  largely

normal,  strongly  favoring  the  mortal  parent,  but  always

prominently bear abnormal features: extra limbs, writhing

cilia,  tentacles,  translucent   esh,  variable  coloration,  or

slavering maws or alien eyes embedded in otherwise normal

 esh. With heavy clothing, a humanoid half-farspawn might

conceal its true nature for a time, but anyone viewing the

half-farspawn without its coverings could not possibly miss

its differences.

Half-farspawn are shunned by most other creatures. While

some aberrations regard a creature descended from the Far

Realm as an honored emissary, most others loathe and detest

half-farspawn.  They  might   nd  refuge  in  the  alien  dimen-

sions from which their farspawn progenitor came, but in the

Material Plane, they are viewed as madness incarnate. Only

alienists and insane cultists regard half-farspawn as allies and

knowingly aid them.

This  hulking,  bipedal  monster  has  a  stooped  frame  and  long,

thickly muscled arms. The creatures  esh is translucent, almost

gelatinous,  and  glistens  wetly.  Its  bullet-shaped  head  has  six

small, yellow eyes, and its powerful mouth is full of black teeth.

A pair of long,  ailing tentacles sprouts from its shoulders.

Half-farspawn  such  as  the  gray  render  described  here  are

sometimes found as the guardians of places sacred to Far Realm

cultists, or as allies of powerful aberrations.

Combat

A half-farspawn gray render is barely sentient, but it wields

its terrible magical powers with crude cunning. It frequently

makes use of its blur, blink, or greater invisibility powers to con-

fuse and disorient its prey. The creature is equally comfortable

in its normal or amorphous forms, and sometimes shifts ran-

domly between them in the course of the same encounter.

A  half-farspawns  natural  weapons  are  treated  as  magic

weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a half-farspawn

gray render must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity.

Rend (Ex): A half-farspawn gray render that wins a grapple

check after a successful bite attack establishes a hold, latching

onto the opponents body and tearing the  esh. This attack

automatically deals 2d6+10 points of damage.

True Strike (Su): Once per day, a half-farspawn can make

a normal attack with a +20 insight bonus on a single attack

roll. The half-farspawn is not affected by the miss chance that

applies to attacks against a concealed target.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  3/dayblur,  blink;  1/daytouch  of

idiocy,  stinking  cloud  (DC  13),  greater  invisibility.  Caster  level

10th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Change Shape (Su): As a standard action, a half-farspawn

gray render can take the form of an amorphous, tentacled mass

at will. While in this form, the creature loses its improved grab

and rend special attacks, as well as its bite and claw natural

attacks.  It  gains  two  additional  tentacle  attacks,  cannot  be

 anked, and is not subject to extra damage from critical hits.

Creatures native to the Material Plane take a 1 morale penalty

on  attack  rolls  against  the  half-farspawn  gray  render  in  its

amorphous form.

CREATING A HALF-FARSPAWN

Half-farspawn  is  an  inherited  template  that  can  be  added

to any corporeal creature of the aberration, animal, dragon,

elemental, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous human-

oid, ooze, plant, or vermin type (hereafter referred to as the

base creature).

A  half-farspawn  uses  all  the  base  creatures  statistics  and

special abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to outsider. Do

not recalculate Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is

unchanged. Half-farspawn are normally native outsiders.

Armor Class: The creatures natural armor improves

by 3.

Attack: A half-farspawn gains two tentacle attacks in addi-

tional to any attacks the base creature could normally make.

If the base creature can use weapons, the half-farspawn can

still do so. A half-farspawn  ghting without weapons uses a

tentacle when making an attack action (unless it has another

natural attack it prefers). When it has a weapon, it uses the

weapon instead.

Full Attack: A half-farspawn  ghting without weapons uses

both its tentacles when making a full attack (plus any other

natural attacks of the base creature). If armed with a weapon,

it uses the weapon as its primary attack and its tentacles as

secondary natural attacks (5 on the attack roll, half Strength

bonus on damage rolls).

Damage: A half-farspawns tentacle attacks deal bludgeoning

damage as shown below.

Special  Attacks:  A  half-farspawn  retains  all  the  special

attacks of the base creature, and gains the following special

attack:

True Strike (Su): Once per day, the creature can make a normal

attack with a +20 insight bonus on a single attack roll. The

half-farspawn is not affected by the miss chance that applies

to attacks against a concealed target.

Spell-Like Abilities: A half-farspawn with an Intelligence

score of 3 or higher has spell-like abilities depending on its Hit

Dice, as indicated below. The abilities are cumulative. Unless oth-

erwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals

the creatures Hit Dice, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

Special Qualities: A half-farspawn has all the special quali-

ties of the base creature, plus the following special qualities:

 Blindsight out to 60 feet.

 Immunity to poison.

 Resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10.

 Damage reduction 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic

(if HD 12 or more).

 A half-farspawns natural weapons are treated as magic

weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

 Spell resistance equal to Hit Dice + 10 (up to a maximum

of 25).

Change  Shape  (Su):  As  a  standard  action,  a  half-farspawn

can take the form of a grotesque, tentacled mass. This ability

functions as described for the change shape ability (see page

306 of the Monster Manual), except as follows:

 The creatures movement modes do not change.

 The creature retains the tentacle attacks granted by this

template (see Attack, above) and gains two additional tentacle

attacks when making a full attack.

 The creature becomes amorphous. It cannot be  anked,

and is not subject to extra damage from critical hits.

 Creatures native to the Material Plane take a 1 morale

penalty on attack rolls against a half-farspawn in its amorphous

form.

Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str

+2, Dex +2, Con +6, Wis +4, Cha +2.

Skills: A half-farspawn gains skill points as an outsider and

has skill points equal to (8 + Int modi er)  (HD + 3). Do not

include Hit Dice from class levels in this calculationthe half-

farspawn gains outsider skill points only for its racial Hit

Dice, and gains the normal amount

of  skill  points  for  its  class  levels.

Treat skills from the base creatures

entry as class skills, and other skills as

cross-class skills.

HALF-FARSPAWN

CHARACTERS

Humanoid  half-farspawn  often

have  a  character  class,  prefer-

ring cleric,  ghter, or sorcerer.

Half-farspawn clerics are devo-

tees  of  terrible  deities  such  as

Tharizdun or Mak Thuum Ngatha,

or  simply  choose  to  venerate

cosmic forces such as destruc-

tion and madness.

153

This powerful quadruped vaguely resembles a huge dog or bear.

Its massive, hairless body ripples with extraordinary musculature.

Its hide is sleek and milky-white in color, and bony plates cover

its head and protect its eyes. Long tentacles ring the head like a

lions mane. Two of the tentacles, longer than the others, end in

oddly humanlike hands.

Pounce (Ex): If a hound of the gloom charges a foe, it can

make a full attack, including two tentacle attacks.

Skills: Hounds of the gloom have a +4 racial bonus on Listen

and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.

Hounds of the gloom remain a mystery. No records of appear-

ances by such creatures go back farther than ten years. Since

then,  sightings  have  become  more  numerous  each  year.

Fortunately, the beasts are still rare in most regions.

Sages speculate that the creatures might be distant relatives

of  displacer  beasts  that  lived  deep  underground,  and  only

within the last decade moved close enough to the surface to

encounter civilized races or even the subterranean-dwelling

dwarves. Whether a desire for fresh hunting grounds or simply

an opportunity to indulge their base curiosity resulted in the

hounds moving toward the surface of the world, they seem

here to stay.

Hounds are aggressive and  erce, but they are not dumb ani-

mals. When hunting, a hound makes use of terrain to gain any

possible advantage. They are normally solitary, but mated pairs

have been encountered. These work together to kill or drive

off any threats to their young. Despite the danger presented

by such fearsome parents, some of the more evil subterranean

races have taken up the practice of capturing young hounds to

raise and train. Speci cally, the neogi, the drow, the grell, and

the mind  ayers all see a use in the powerful beasts. If a pup is

taken young enough, it accepts its new world easily, especially

if its well fed and allowed to  ght. Some underground races

have also trained hounds as gladiatorial beasts to  ght and die

in arenas.

An average hound of the gloom weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Hounds  understand  Undercommon  but  do  not  speak  any

humanoid language (although they can converse with each

other in their own language).

COMBAT

Hounds ambush victims by leaping directly into melee. They

use their natural climbing ability to reach a point above their

target, then leap down in a deadly pounce from above. The crea-

tures attack with bite, foreclaws, and the two larger tentacles

surrounding  their  heads,  which  are  much  longer  than  the

others. These two tentacles have a reach of 10 feet and end in

 ve- ngered hands that look almost identical to human hands,

except they have strong, sharp claws instead of nails.

Once engaged, a hound uses its bite and claw attacks against

a single foe. A target that withstands several blows or one that

deals the hound a signi cant amount of damage is the target

of the hounds poisoned hands.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the hound must

hit with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 23, initial and secondary

damage 1d8 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

ILLITHIDAE

Creatures that originated in the same alien and hostile world

as  the  mind   ayers,  the  illithidae  are  an  order  of  creatures

that are related to mind  ayers in much the same way that

terrestrial animals such as wolves, bears, or apes share some

kinship with humans. Several of the more common examples

of these creatures are presented below. They inhabit under-

ground areas where illithid lairs or cities can be found. Its

unknown  whether  these  beasts  are  simply  attracted  to  the

regions where mind  ayers live or are deliberately domesticated

by illithids.

This hulking creatures body resembles a big sack. Its slimy skin is

blotched with black, gray, white, and a dull red. It has stout limbs

that are clawed at the ends, and its large, lumpy head bears a

saw-edged beak. Eight tentacles are arrayed more or less evenly

across its wrinkled body. Each tentacle is as thick as a mans thigh

at its base and tapers down to three  ngerlike appendages at the

end. The tentacles also have numerous suckers and bony hooks

on their undersides.

An embrac is an ambush predator. It uses its Hide skill and

the shadows of the underground to lurk near a subterranean

passageway, trail, or body of water and wait for prey to come

within reach. If overmatched, an embrac is not far from a small

cave it can use as a bolthole to escape.

Combat

When prey comes within reach, an embrac lashes out with a

tentacle. Although the monster has eight tentacles, it can use

only four to attack in the same round; it uses its remaining

tentacles to gain leverage and hold its place.

An opponent can make sunder attempts against an embracs

tentacles as if they were weapons. An embracs tentacles have 10

hit points each. If an embrac is currently grappling a target with

one tentacle, it uses another to make its attack of opportunity

against the sunder attempt. Severing an embracs tentacle deals

5 points of damage to the embrac. An embrac regrows severed

tentacles in 1d10+10 days.

Constrict (Ex): An embrac deals 2d4+6 points of damage

with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an embrac must hit

with its tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If

it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can deal

constrict damage.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary

Dangerous underground predators, kigrids attack any poten-

tial prey they encounter. They are persistent and determined

stalkers, using their darkvision and scent abilities to identify

and follow their quarry.

Kigrids  are  cunning  hunters  that  try  to  force  their  prey

into dead-end tunnels, off cliff edges, and into other obstacles

to prevent their escape. If their quarry puts up determined

resistance,  the  kigrids  might  negotiate  or  withdraw  if  the

entire  pack  is  in  danger.  Kigrids  seem  to  understand  most

spoken languages (perhaps this is a latent psionic ability) and

can reply in Undercommon with a growling, howling voice.

Combat

A kigrid pulls down prey with its powerful bite. It uses its

poisonous  rake  to   nish  off  grappled  opponents.  A  kigrid

cannot begin a grapple and perform a rake attack in the same

round.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a kigrid must hit

with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and makes two

rake attacks against its foe.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial and secondary

damage 1d4 Dex. A kigrid delivers its poison only with its rake

special attack (it has poison spurs near its rear claws). The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Psionics  (Sp):  3/dayblink,  daze  monster  (DC  12),  detect

thoughts (DC 12). Caster level 5th. The save DCs are Charisma-

based.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +10, damage 1d6+2 plus poison

(see above). A kigrid makes two rake attacks when it attacks a

grappled opponent.

Skills: Kigrids have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move

Silently, and Spot checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Jump and

Survival checks.

This baboonlike creature has a beard of half a dozen small ten-

tacles hanging from its chin. Its fur is a murky brown color, and it

has large, blue-black eyes. It stands about 3 feet high but moves

in a crouch, with arms as long as its legs. It has three  ngers on

each hand and three toes on each foot.

Saltors are just one of many kinds of subterranean scavengers.

They eat anything they can catch: worms, grubs, snails,  sh,

cray sh, moss, fungi, and so on. As might be expected, their

diet is light on protein; this can make them dangerous foes to

small, lightly armed, or wounded parties of adventurers.

Saltors are intelligent beings, and they know well that they

are weaker than most other underground dwellers. To compen-

sate for this, they use weapons and tools to make foraging and

hunting small game easier. Parties that treat saltors well and

have metal tools to offer might be able to garner information

from the creatures about the region in which they live. Saltors

speak Undercommon in a barking tone.

Combat

Even a pack of saltors would not be a match for a well-equipped

and wary party of heroes if not for the creatures psionics and

special sonic attack.

Psionics (Sp): 3/dayblur, magic missile; 1/dayhaste (self

only). Caster level 3rd.

Screech  (Su):  As  a  standard  action,  a  saltor  can  emit  a

high-pitched,  piercing  shriek  in  a  20-foot  cone.  The  shriek

deals 2d8 points of sonic damage to all nonsaltors and stuns

such creatures for 1 round. A DC 14 Fortitude save negates the

stun and halves the damage. Once it screeches, a saltor cannot

screech again for 1 hour, so saltors save their screeches until

they are sure they need them.

One  saltor  screeching  sets  off  all  the  other  adults  in  the

troop  as  well.  This  protective  measure  allows  the  troop  to

COMBAT

An alhoon is a horrendously for-

midable foe. It uses spells such as

greater invisibility, stoneskin,

resist  energy,  mage  armor,

haste, and see invisibility to

protect itself and improve

its odds in battle.

An alhoons nat-

ural weapons are

treated as magic

weapons  for  the

purpose  of  over-

coming damage

reduction.

Extract  (Ex):

An alhoon that begins its

turn  with  all  four  tenta-

cles attached and that

makes  a  success-

ful  grapple

check  auto-

matically

extracts the opponents brain, instantly killing that creature.

This power is useless against constructs, elementals,  oozes,

plants, and undead. It is not instantly fatal to foes with mul-

tiple heads.

Fear Aura (Su): Like all liches, an alhoon is surrounded by

a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of fewer than 5 Hit

Dice in a 60-foot radius that look at an alhoon must succeed

on a DC 22 Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell

(caster level 12th). The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature

that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same

alhoons aura for 24 hours.

157

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an alhoon must hit

a Small, Medium, or Large creature with its tentacle attack. It

can then attempt to grapple as a free action without provoking

attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and attaches the tentacle to the opponents head.

If  an  alhoon  begins  its  turn  with  at  least  one  tentacle

attached, it can attach its remaining tentacles with a single

grapple check. The opponent can escape with a single success-

ful grapple check or an Escape Artist check, but the alhoon

gets a +2 circumstance bonus on the check for every tentacle

that was attached at the beginning of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): An alhoon can discharge a devastating

psionic attack in the form of a cone 60 feet long. Anyone caught

in this cone must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be stunned

for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. This ability is

the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Negative Energy Touch (Su): An alhoon has a melee touch

attack that uses negative energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage

to living creatures; a Will save (DC 28) halves the damage. An

alhoon can use this in place of its tentacle attacks (in which

case  the  negative  energy  touch  is  a  melee  touch  attack),  or

instead make a normal tentacle attack and add the negative

energy damage (in which case it is a melee attack, not a melee

touch attack).

A creature struck by the negative energy touch when used

as a melee touch attack is also subject to an alhoons paralyzing

touch (see below).

Paralyzing  Touch  (Su):  Any  living  creature  hit  by  an

alhoons touch attack must succeed on a DC 28 Fortitude save

or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that

can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse

spell description, page 203 of the Players Handbook). The effect

cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by an alhoon seems

dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals

that the victim is still alive. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Psionics  (Sp):  At  willcharm  monster  (DC  22),  detect

thoughts (DC 20), levitate, plane shift, suggestion (DC 21). Effec-

tive caster level 8th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. If you

are using the Expanded Psionics Handbook, the alhoon has the

same psionic ability as a normal psionic mind  ayer (see page

204, Expanded Psionic Handbook).

Undead Traits: An alhoon is immune to mind-affecting

spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not

subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy

drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. It

has darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: Like other liches, alhoons have a +8 racial bonus on

Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot

checks.

head  is  octopoidal  in  form,  with  four  short  tentacles  and  two

much longer ones where its mouth should be. Its eyes are blank

orbs of silver-white.

An ulitharid is in all ways a bigger, stronger, nastier mind  ayer.

It towers over other illithids, and in addition to the normal four

tentacles of its race, it has two much longer tentacles that are

nearly the length of its body. It is also smarter, worse-tempered,

and much more dangerous than its smaller kin. Fortunately,

ulitharids are also quite rare.

An ulitharid is the result of unknown forces playing

on a mind  ayer tadpole at a very early age. Even the

mind  ayers themselves cannot identify ulitharid

tadpoles until after they are implanted into the skull

of a victim. Their potential becomes apparent only

after ceremorphosis has progressed far enough to

show that the creature possesses six tentacles. Fewer

than  one  in  a  hundred  illithid  tadpoles  become

ulitharids.

Ulitharids  are  treated  almost  as

minor deities within those communi-

ties  lucky  enough  to  claim  one  as  a

resident. They occupy a position just

below  the  elder  brains  in  the  illithid

social  hierarchy.  Their  egos  expand  to

match their stature; they look down upon

normal mind  ayers in much the same way

that mind  ayers look down on urophions.

COMBAT

An  ulitharid  is  a  tremendously

dangerous foe in combat, because its

potent mental attacks are backed

up by 10-foot reach and a grapple

ability re ective of the creatures

large size. An ulitharid can

protect itself with psionic

mage armor (re ected in the

statistics  above), and  it  normally

maintains this power at all times.

Extract (Ex): An ulitharid that begins its turn with at least

four tentacles attached and that makes a successful grapple

check automatically extracts the opponents brain, instantly

killing that creature. This power is useless against constructs,

elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. It is not instantly fatal

to foes with multiple heads.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an ulitharid must

hit a Small, Medium, or Large creature with its tentacle attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check,  it  establishes  a  hold  and  attaches  the  tentacle  to

the opponents head. An ulitharid can grab a Huge

or larger creature only if it can somehow reach the

foes head.

If an ulitharid begins its turn with at least one

tentacle attached, it can try to attach its remaining

tentacles with a single grapple check. The opponent

can escape with a single successful grapple check

or an Escape Artist check, but the ulitharid gets

a +2 circumstance bonus on the check for every

tentacle that was attached at the beginning of

the opponents turn.

Mind  Blast (Sp):  An  ulitharid  can

discharge a devastating psionic attack in

the form of a cone 60 feet long. Anyone

caught in this cone must succeed on a

DC 21 Will save or be stunned for 3d4

rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-

level spell.

Psionics  (Sp):  At  willcharm

If you are playing with the Expanded Psionics Handbook, adjust

the ulitharid as follows:

Vampire illithid

Humanoid  in  shape,  this  gaunt,  hairless  creature  has  mottled

gray skin, a hunched posture, and long, dangerous-looking talons

for hands. Its face is a thing out of a nightmare, a  attened octo-

poid  head  with  four  long,  writhing  tentacles  where  the  mouth

should be. Its colorless eyes glitter with feral hunger.

160

Vampiric mind  ayers are enigmas. Their origins are unknown,

as they cannot spawn other vampires. They need both fresh

blood and fresh brains to survive. Furthermore, they are feral,

unreasoning killers, with no hint of the formidable intellect

they possessed in life. Whatever process transforms a mind

 ayer into a vampiric state also destroys its rationality.

An illithid vampire presents a dire threat to any living thing

it encounters. Its hunger for blood and brains is limitless and

beyond reason. While it lacks the cold genius it once possessed,

the creature is astoundingly cunning, and its inventiveness is

matched only by its savagery.

A vampiric mind

 ayer  is  a  unique

and speci c form

of undead, more

like  a  wight  or

a  wraith  than  a

vampire.  It  is  not

derived  from  adding

the  vampire  template

to a mind  ayer.

COMBAT

An illithid vampire uses

every  conceivable  trick

and  power  at  its  disposal

when  confronting

prey.  Although

they  are  not  pa-

tient  creatures  by

temperament, they

can  stalk  victims  for

days before striking. Once

combat  is  joined,  a  vampire

quickly seeks to disable as many

foes as possible. If necessary, it strikes

and then retreats, hoping to burden its prey

with  wounded  or  incapacitated   gures  before

making its  nal assault.

A vampiric illithids natural attacks are treated

as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Blood  Drain  (Ex):  A  vampiric  illithid  that  attaches  a

tentacle to its foe drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Consti-

tution damage and gaining 5 temporary hit points per point

drained during each round that it keeps at least one tentacle

attached.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a vampiric mind

 ayers tentacles or slam attack gain two negative  levels. For

each  negative  level  bestowed,  the  vampiric  illithid  gains  5

temporary hit points. This energy drain ability can be used

once per round.

Extract (Ex): An illithid vampire that begins its turn with

all four tentacles attached and that makes a successful grapple

check automatically extracts the opponents brain, instantly

killing that creature. This power is useless against constructs,

elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. It is not instantly fatal

to foes with multiple heads.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an illithid vampire

must hit a Small, Medium, or Large creature with its tentacle

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity.  If  it  wins  the

grapple check, it establishes a hold, attaches the tentacle to

the opponents head, and drains blood (see below). A vampiric

illithid can grab a Huge or larger creature only if it can some-

how reach the foes head.

If an illithid vampire begins its turn with at least one tentacle

attached, it drains blood and can try to attach its remaining

tentacles with a single grapple check. The opponent can escape

with  a  single  successful  grapple  check  or  an  Escape  Artist

check, but the illithid vampire gets a +2 circumstance bonus

on the grapple check for every tentacle that was attached at

the beginning of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): A vampiric illithid can discharge a dev-

astating psionic attack in the form of a 60-foot cone. Anyone

caught in this cone must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be

stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. This

ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Fast Healing (Ex): A vampiric mind  ayer heals 5 points

of damage per round as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If

reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it is destroyed.

Undead Traits: An illithid vampire is immune to mind-

affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis,

stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless.

It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal

damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability

drain,  energy  drain,  fatigue,  exhaustion,  or  death  from

massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection

works  only  if  it  is  willing.  It  has  darkvision  out  to

60 feet.

PSEUDONATURAL

CREATURE

Past  the  timeless  eons  that  lie

between the stars, pseudonatural

creatures dwell beyond the planes

as  we  know  them,  nestled  in  far

realms of insanity. When summoned

to the Material Plane, they often take

on the form and abilities of familiar

creatures,  though  they  are  more

gruesome in appearance than their

earthly counterparts. Alternatively,

they might appear in a manner more consis-

tent  with  their  origins,  manifesting  as

masses  of  writhing  tentacles  or  other

even more terrible-looking forms.

Combat

A pseudonatural hippogriff dives at its prey and strikes with

its clawed forelegs. When it cannot dive, it slashes with claws

and beak.

Alternate Form (Su): As a standard action, a pseudonatural

hippogriff  can  take  the  form  of  a  grotesque,  tentacled  mass

(though this alien appearance has no effect on the creatures abili-

ties). Other creatures receive a 1 morale penalty on their attack

rolls against the creature when it is in this alternate form.

True Strike (Su): Once per day, a pseudonatural hippogriff

can gain a +20 insight bonus on a single attack roll. In addition,

the creature suffers no miss chance against a target that has

concealment or total concealment when making this attack.

Skills: Hippogriffs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A pseudonatural creature uses all the base creatures statistics

and abilities except as noted here. Even though the creatures

type changes, do not recalculate Hit Dice, base attack bonus,

or skill points.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to outsider. Size

is unchanged.

Special Attacks: A pseudonatural creature retains all the

special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following

attack.

True Strike (Su): Once per day, a pseudonatural creature can

gain a +20 insight bonus on a single attack roll. In addition,

the creature suffers no miss chance against a target that has

concealment or total concealment when making this attack.

Special  Qualities:  A  pseudonatural  creature  retains  all

the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the

following special qualities.

Resistance (Ex): A pseudonatural creature has resistance to

acid and electricity based on the base creatures Hit Dice (see

the table below).

unchanged. Other creatures receive a 1 morale penalty on

their attack rolls against a pseudonatural creature when it is

in this alternate form.

Spell  Resistance  (Ex):  A  pseudonatural  creature  gains  spell

resistance equal to 10 + the base creatures HD (maximum 25).

Abilities: Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is

at least 3.

PSURLON

Psurlons  are  wormlike  creatures  with  formidable  mental

powers. They dwell in the deep desert and pose a consid-

erable  threat  to  passing  travelers  or  nearby  settlements.

Psurlons detest humanoids of any sort, and go to considerable

lengths to kill or drive off any they come across. From time

to time, they seek to foment trouble by manipulating lead-

ers, dealing with evil folk who are willing to accommodate

the psurlons wishes in exchange for psurlon assistance, or

duping weak-minded creatures such as goblinoids or gnolls

into  ghting for them.

A psurlon has a long, tubular, pink body divided into subtle

rings or segments, just like an earthworms body. It also has

two arms and two legs, also segmented. The psurlons head is

little more than a blunt end to its tubular body. Its only facial

feature is a large, circular mouth  lled with gnashing teeth.

It has visual organs (for darkvision) spaced evenly around the

head.  The  typical  psurlon  wears  a  decorative  or  utilitarian

belt  tted with straps and hooks to carry items, but no other

clothing or armor.

Psurlons are clever, malicious, and deceitful. While their

psionic powers are telekinetic in nature and offer little abil-

ity to directly control an enemys mind, they are skillful liars

that inveigle the unwary. They always seek to misinform and

mislead their enemies, and delight in arranging for their foes

to  ght one another.

Psurlons choose to live solitary lives, but sometimes form

small communities called clusters. The most powerful elder in

a psurlon cluster leads the group, although elders are frequently

replaced by younger, more ambitious psurlons when their plans

go awry.

Psurlons can speak Undercommon but rarely do so. Instead,

they rely on their natural telepathic powers.

COMBAT

Psurlons never use melee weapons. They can  ght with their

bare claws and teeth, but they are not particularly formidable in

melee combat. Instead, they attack with their psionic powers,

battering foes with telekinetic blasts or immobilizing them

with mental energy.

Blindsight (Ex): A psurlon can ascertain its surroundings

by sensing sound, scent, heat, and vibration. This ability enables

it to discern objects and creatures within 60 feet. The psurlon

does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures

within range of its blindsight.

PSURLON VARIETIES

Psurlons come in three different varieties: average psurlons,

elder  psurlons,  and  giant  psurlons.  Most  average  psurlons

advance by Hit Dice until they reach 12 Hit Dice, at which

point they become elder psurlons and gain additional mental

powers. Elder psurlons advance by class, and most eventually

take levels in psion, sorcerer, or wizard.

A small number of psurlons that reach 12 Hit Dice fail to

manifest  the  advanced  mental  powers  of  an  elder  psurlon.

Instead,  they  continue  to  grow  physically  larger  and  more

powerful. Giant psurlons gain few new mental abilities, but

they are dangerous opponents in physical combat.

Most psurlons are average psurlons. Dangerous and malevolent

when encountered as solitary hermits, hunters, or spies, they

sometimes are found in small bands known as clusters. Average

psurlons hardly consider themselves average in any way, and

each member of a cluster regards itself as the rightful leader

and most intelligent example of its kind. They frequently plot

and scheme for status within the cluster, seeking the right to

challenge and replace the elders over them.

Psurlons  are  suspicious,  bad-tempered,  and  cruel.  While

they lack the ability to enslave with the power of the mind,

they are certainly capable of taking slaves through threat of

force.

An average psurlon stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about

130 pounds.

Combat

Although  they  do  not  relish  combat,  average  psurlons  are

perfectly willing to attack an enemy if they feel they possess

the advantages of position or surprise. They use invisibility to

set up ambushes whenever possible.

In battle, psurlons make frequent use of their telekinesis abil-

ity, hurling their foes against nearby walls or into dangerous

terrain, or pelting their enemies with heavy boulders if a foe

is too heavy to  ing. Average psurlons save their dimension door

ability to escape from a battle they are in danger of losing.

Average psurlons have the ability to use mage armor at will, so

the statistics above include mage armor in the psurlons Armor

Class.

Psionics (Sp): At willdetect thoughts (DC 15), mage armor,

sound burst (DC 15); 3/dayhold monster (DC 18), invisibility,

lightning bolt (DC 16), telekinesis (DC 18); 1/daydimension door.

Caster level 7th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

This bloated monstrosity has a brick-red body and a blunt, cir-

cular maw for a head. Its arms and legs are tipped with vicious-

looking claws. Small, dark eye-dots ring its mouth.

Average psurlons that survive long enough eventually trans-

form into elder psurlons. Elder psurlons are cluster leaders,

the masterminds of their kind. Experienced, resourceful, and

gifted with superior mental abilities, an elder psurlon has the

respect of its lesser fellowsat least until a younger psurlon

approaches its own transformation into an elder.

An elder psurlon stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about

200 pounds. It is noticeably darker in color than an average

psurlon; its skin is a deep, brick-red color.

Combat

Elder psurlons use much the same tactics as average psurlons

do, but they are more likely to direct the battle from the rear

while their underlings bear the brunt of the  ghting. They

have a limited ability to compel and subvert their enemies

minds, and seek to do so early in an encounter.

Psionics (Sp): At willdetect thoughts (DC 17), mage armor,

A lean, wormlike monster the size of an ogre lurks here. Its tubu-

lar body is a light blue color, subtly banded and segmented like

the body of an earthworm. It has long, clawed arms and legs,

and a blunt, circular maw for a head. Small, dark eye-dots ring

its mouth.

Giant psurlon

From time to time, average psurlons undergoing the trans-

formation to elder do not manifest their new psionic powers,

but instead undergo startling physical growth instead. Giant

psurlons  are  every  bit  as  intelligent  and  deceitful  as  their

average comrades, but defer to the will of the ruling psurlon

elder in a cluster.

A giant psurlon stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 900

pounds.

Combat

A giant psurlon prefers to attack from afar, hammering foes

with  telekinetic  attacks  and  lightning  bolts  before  closing

in to  nish them in melee. It makes good use of its Quicken

Spell-Like Ability feat to launch a dizzying barrage of psionic

and physical attacks against its foes.

Psionics (Sp): At willdetect thoughts (DC 16), mage armor,

sound burst (DC 16); 3/dayhold monster (DC 19), invisibility,

PSURLON CHARACTERS

Most average psurlons advance by Hit Dice, not by character

class, but there are occasional

exceptions.  Psurlons  wor-

ship Mak Thuum Ngatha,

an  entity  of  the  Far

Realm. Psurlon clerics

can  choose  from  the

domains  of  Destruc-

tion,  Knowledge,

Madness,  or  Travel.

A  psurlons  favored

class is wizard.

tentacles, which they use to slam any targets in reach (other

than aboleths).

Engulf (Ex): A shaboath can attempt to engulf a grabbed

opponent that is equal to or smaller than its size category by

making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent

takes 2d10+10 points of crushing damage per round. If the

opponent cannot breathe water, it must hold its breath or begin

to drown. An engulfed creature can escape by making a suc-

cessful grapple check or Escape Artist check. The amount of

time a creature can hold its breath if it takes a standard action

is reduced by 1 round. A shaboath can engulf 1 Large creature,

2 Medium creatures, 4 Small creatures, 8 Tiny creatures, 16

Diminutive creatures, or 32 Fine creatures at one time.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a shaboath must

hit with a slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it can attempt to engulf the target in

the following round.

Wall of Ice (Su): A shaboath can generate a wall of ice (as

the spell, caster level 20th) once per minute as a standard action

that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Construct Traits: A shaboath has immunity to poison, sleep

effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy

effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms, compul-

sions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect

that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects

or is harmless. It is not subject to extra damage from critical

hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue,

exhaustion,  or  energy  drain.  It  cannot  heal  damage,  but  it

can be repaired. It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light

vision.

Watery Concealment (Ex): A shaboath that is completely

underwater is dif cult to see. Its form constantly shifts and

blends  with  the  surrounding  water,  granting  the  creature

concealment.

A pool of seething  uid piles up on itself, forming an undulant

mass of four large tentacles joined to a central mound of thick,

syrupy liquid.

Shaboaths are constructs created by powerful aboleths to guard

their  cities  and  perform  various  errands.  They  have  bodies

made of thick, transparent  uidwater tainted with the slime

exuded by a savant aboleth. A shaboath is a shapeless creature

that resembles a sphere or pool of water when at rest. When it

attacks, it creates four large pseudopods.

A  shaboath  is  about  10  feet  wide,  with  10-foot-long

tentacles. It weighs about 12,000 pounds.

A shaboath cannot speak nor make any vocal noise.

The creature carries with it a distinctive musty smell,

like that of mildew or swamp water. On land, it moves

with a sloshing, undulant coiling, and leaves a trail

of moisture in its wake.

COMBAT

Shaboaths  are  relentless  combat-

ants.  They  are  dif cult  to  harm

with weaponry and are immune

to  many  spells  and  energy

types; only  re is guaranteed

to  be  effective  against  them.

SHADOW

CREATURE

Shadow creatures dwell on the Plane

of  Shadow,  sometimes  crossing

into  other  planes  where  the

barriers  between  dimensions

are weak. Just as parts of the Plane

of Shadow resemble a strange, distorted

version of the Material Plane, shadow crea-

tures  super cially  resemble  creatures

from  the  Material  Plane.  Shadow

creatures  are  darker,  more  elusive,

and  spookier  than  their  material

counterparts.

Shadow creatures are not to be

confused  with  shadows  (undead

creatures  that  dwell  on  the  Plane

of Shadow). Other creatures native

to the Plane of Shadow exist that have

stronger or weaker connections to the

energies of that place (such as the shadow mastiff)

and therefore do not follow this template.

Level Adjustment: 

A creature lurks in the shadows. Its dark, mottled body resembles

that of a naked hal ing, but its limbs are incredibly spindly and

long. It seems to be almost a living shadowan oily, liquid crea-

ture of the darkness.

Combat

A shadow choker uses its shadow

blend ability to strike from the

shadows. If badly wounded,

it  is  likely  to  withdraw

from  combat  and  stalk

its  intended  prey  for  a

short time to give its fast

healing a chance to work

before striking again.

Constrict  (Ex):  The

shadow  choker  deals

1d3+3 points of damage

with a successful grapple

check against a Large or

smaller creature. Because

it  seizes  its  victim  by  the

neck,  a  creature  in  the

chokers grasp cannot speak

or cast spells with a verbal

component.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To

use  this  ability,  a  shadow  choker

must hit a Large or smaller opponent

with  a  tentacle  attack.  It  can  then

attempt  to  start  a  grapple  as  a  free

action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check,  it  establishes  a  hold  and

can  constrict.  Chokers  receive  a

+4 racial bonus on grapple checks, which is already included

in the statistics block.

Quickness  (Su):  Although  not  particularly  dexterous,  a

choker is supernaturally quick. It can take an extra standard

action or move action during its turn each round.

Shadow  Blend  (Su):  In  any  conditions  other  than  full

daylight,  a  shadow  choker  can  disappear  into  the  shadows,

giving  it  total  concealment.  Arti cial  illumination,  even  a

light or continual  ame spell, does not negate this ability, but a

daylight spell will.

Skills: A shadow choker has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened. A shadow choker has a +6 racial

bonus on Move Silently checks.

CREATING A SHADOW CREATURE

Shadow  is  a  template  that  can  be  added  to  any  corporeal

aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast,

monstrous humanoid, plant, undead, or vermin (referred to

hereafter as the base creature).

A shadow creature uses all the base creatures statistics and

abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creatures

Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type

changes.

Size  and  Type:  Animals  or  vermin  with  this  template

become  magical  beasts,  but  otherwise  the  creature  type  is

unchanged. Shadow creatures encountered on the Material

Plane have the extraplanar subtype and are native to the Plane

of Shadow.

Speed: As base creature  1-1/2.

Special Qualities: A shadow creature retains all the special

qualities of the base creature, and also gains the following:

 Resistance to cold equal to 5 + 1 per Hit Die, to a maxi-

mum of 15.

 Darkvision out to 60 feet.

 Low-light vision.

  Shadow  Blend  (Su):  In  any  conditions  other  than  full

daylight, a shadow creature can disappear into the shadows,

giving  it  total  concealment.  Arti cial  illumination,  even  a

light or continual  ame spell, does not negate this ability, but a

daylight spell will.

Shadow creatures also have one additional special ability

for every 4 Hit Dice they possess (minimum of one additional

ability) chosen from the following list:

 +2 luck bonus on all saving throws.

Cause Fear (Sp): 1/day. Caster level 5th. The save DC is

Charisma-based.

Damage reduction 5/magic.

Evasion, as the rogue class feature.

Fast healing 2.

Mirror Image (Sp): 1/day. Caster level 5th.

Plane Shift (Sp): 1/day, to or from the Plane of Shadow only.

Caster level 15th.

If the base creature already has one or more of these special

qualities, use the better value.

Skills: Same as base creature. Shadow creatures gain a +6

racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

This cloud of pale green mist de es the laws of nature, coiling

and  roiling  almost  with  a  mind  of  its  own.  Long,  dark  green

spines the size of a rapier blade, up to four at a time, constantly

form and dissolve within the cloud. Suddenly, it collapses in on

itself to take on the crude form of a  ying eight-limbed creature.

The four upper limbs end in long spines, and the four lower limbs

end in tiny, four- ngered  hands. Its roughly humanoid  torso  is

covered with dark green plates, and its head is a writhing mass

of tendrils.

The silthilar are an unusual form of colonial intelligence found

only  in  the  most  tangled  and  remote  forests  of  the  world.

They are all that remains of a proud and ancient race of sylvan

creatures that had mastered the art of grafting and shaping

living  esh to suit their own needs. Their world crumbled eons

ago when their research unleashed a terrible magic plague.

Silthilar wizards, in an act of desperation, worked a powerful

spell that separated their minds from their failing bodies. The

spell shattered their minds into millions of tiny motes of  esh

and bone, each of which served as a vessel for a single piece of

silthilar lore. Alone, a single piece of  esh or bone was nothing

more than quiescent lore, but together, the particles formed

a powerful hive mind capable of organizing thousands upon

thousands of similar particles into a single entity.

Today, the silthilar exist as these hive-mind swarms. In their

new form, the silthilar are free to pursue their research and

experiments without fear of disease or old age. Fortunately,

their curiosity about the  esh is tempered by their respect for

life. With the notable exception of rogue swarms, most silthilar

restrain their research to volunteers who seek out the silthilar

to enhance their own bodies.

A  silthilar  swarm  that  is  at  rest  or  performing  research

appears as a roiling cloud of green particles. Up close, a single

particle appears as a tiny sphere of  eshy tendrils and bony

spines, no more than half an inch in diameter and often much

smaller than that.

Unlike other swarms, a silthilar swarm can organize itself

and transform into a solid shape that closely approximates that

of their original body, although one without distinguishing

features. In this form, a silthilar is roughly human-sized and

shaped, with eight long, thin limbs arranged

in a radial pattern around the body in two

rings of four. Its four lower extremities

end  in  tiny  hands,  each  with  four

 ngers extending in a radial pattern

from  the  palm,  that  wield  kukris.

(When  a  silthilar  assumes  swarm

form,  it  stores  these  weapons  in

an  extradimensional  pocket.)  Its

upper  arms  are  arranged  in  a

similar  manner,  and  each  ends

in a long, thin spine that serves

as a natural weapon. A silthilars

head is a roughly spherical mass

of hundreds of thin tendrils.

Silthilar  speak  their  own

language,  and  their  high  intel-

ligence  allows  them  to  speak

many other languages as well.

All  languages  are  considered

bonus  languages  for  silthilar.

Their  voices  have  a  distinct

buzzing to their otherwise airy

tones.

Infestation (Su): A silthilar can infest any living creature

it strikes with its claws or its swarm damage. A creature so

struck must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points

of ability damage selected randomly from Strength, Dexterity,

or Constitution. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Warp  Flesh  (Su):  As  a  full-round  action  that  provokes

attacks of opportunity, a silthilar in swarm form can focus

its attention on a single living creature that shares one of its

squares. The target must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be

transformed  into  an  entirely  different  creature.  This  effect

is  identical  to  polymorph  any  object

(caster  level  9th),  except  that  it  can

only  change  a  living  creature  into

another living creature (see the spell

description, pager 263 of the Players

Handbook). A silthilar does not deal

normal swarm damage or cause

distraction on a round in which

it warps  esh. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Coalesced  Form  (Su):  As

a  standard  action  that  pro-

vokes  attacks  of  opportunity,

a  silthilar  can  switch  from

its  swarm  form  to  its  solid

form. Retrieving its weapons

from  their  extradimensional

pockets  is  a  free  action  that

does  not  provoke  attacks  of

opportunity.  A  silthilar

does not regain lost hit

points when it changes

form.  It  can  remain  in

either  form  as  long  as

it likes.

COMBAT

A  silthilar  swarms  attacks  depend

on  its  current  shape.  As  a  swarm,  it

prefers to simply engulf enemies and scour

away at exposed  esh, dealing 2d6 points of

damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end

of its move. In its coalesced form, a silthilar attacks more

conventionally; it can use its kukris or its spines with great

 nesse, although it can only bring four natural weapons to

bear in a single round (either the four kukris or the four

spines, but not some of each).

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn

with a silthilar in swarm form in its square is nauseated for 1

round; a DC 17 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even with a

successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within

the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20

+ spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentra-

tion requires a DC 20 Concentration check. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Silthilar

In its coalesced form,

a silthilar is treated as a

Medium aberration with

a space/reach of 5 feet/5

feet. It loses its +8 size bonus to its

Armor Class and attack rolls, but gains a

+8 natural armor bonus from the dense plates of hardened bone

and chitin that cover its body. It retains the swarm subtype and

all the traits associated with that swarm with the exception

of its swarm attack and distraction ability. As a swarm of Fine

creatures, it is not subject to extra damage from critical hits

and retains its immunity to weapon damage. If a silthilar is

struck with a physical attack, it must make a Concentration

check (DC 10 + the number of points of damage dealt by the

attack) or revert immediately to swarm form and be nauseated

for 1d4 rounds.

Immortality (Ex): A silthilar does not age, nor can it be

harmed by effects that cause magical aging.

Swarm Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no

discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to extra damage from

169

Urophion

critical hits or  anking. A swarm composed of Fine creatures

is immune to all weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm

to break up, though damage taken until that point does not

degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never

staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they

cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot

grapple another.

A  swarm  is  immune  to  any  spell  or

effect  that  targets  a  speci c  number  of

creatures  (including  single-target

spells such as disintegrate), with the

exception  of  mind-affecting  spells

and  abilities  if  the  swarm  has  an

intelligence  score  and  a  hive  mind.

A swarm takes half again as much

damage  (+50%)  from  spells  or

effects that affect an area, such

as splash weapons and many

evocation spells.

Swarms  made  up  of  Di-

minutive  or  Fine  creatures

are susceptible to high winds

such  as  that  cre-

ated  by  a  gust

of wind spell.

For  the

purpose

of  deter-

mining  the

effect  of  wind  on

a swarm, treat

the swarm

as  a  crea-

ture  of  the

same  size  as

its  constituent  crea-

tures.  Wind   effects  deal

1d6 points of nonlethal damage

to a swarm per spell level (or Hit Die of the

originating creature, in the case of effects such as an air

elementals whirlwind).

A  swarm  rendered  unconscious  by  means  of  nonlethal

damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not

re-form until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.

SILTHILAR CHARACTERS

Many silthilar gain class levels (often as wizards). A silthilar

gains the bene ts of increased Hit Dice, base attack bonuses,

saving throw bonuses, and skill points from its class levels in

both of its forms. It can use class features and spellcasting abili-

ties only in its coalesced form; these abilities are suppressed

while the creature is in swarm form.

This creature strongly resembles a natural stalagmite almost 10

feet  tall.  A  single  red  eye  glares  above  a  huge  maw   lled  with

jagged teeth, and thin,  exible strands or tendrils whip around

its rocky body.

A urophion is the result when an illithid tadpole is implanted

into a ropers brain. These miserable creatures are nearly as

intelligent as their mind  ayer kin, but they are treated as no

more than convenient tools for the mind  ayers to use as they

see  t. They live lonely, brooding lives on the fringes of mind

 ayer society, serving as guardians and sentinels, with little

reward for their loyalty other than the promise of joining the

elder brain on death.

COMBAT

Like a roper, a urophion hunts by standing completely still

until prey wanders near. It can then use detect thoughts to pick

out the best targets for immediate attack, which it launches

with surprise.

Drag (Ex): If a urophion hits with a strand attack, the strand

latches onto the opponents body. This deals no damage but

drags the stuck opponent 10 feet closer each subsequent round

(provoking  no  attack  of  opportunity)  unless  that  creature

breaks free, which requires a DC 24 Escape Artist check or a

DC 20 Strength check. The check DCs are Strength-based, and

the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial bonus. A urophion

can draw a creature to within 10 feet of itself and bite with a

+4 attack bonus in the same round.

A strand has 10 hit points and can be attacked by making

a  successful  sunder  attempt.  Attacking  a  urophions  strand

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the strand is cur-

rently attached to a target, the urophion takes a 4 penalty on

its attack roll to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a strand

deals no damage to the urophion itself.

Strands  (Ex):  Most  encounters  with  a  urophion  begin

when it  res strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up

to six strands at once, and they can strike up to 50 feet away

(no range increment). If one of its strand is severed, a urophion

can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free action.

Weakness (Ex): A urophions strands can sap an opponents

strength. Anyone grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC

19 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of Strength damage. The

save DC is Constitution-based.

Skills: Urophions have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks

in stony or icy areas.

ZEUGALAK

Huge Aberration

Hit Dice: 16d8+128 (200 hp)

Initiative: +3

Speed: 30 ft. (6 squares), climb 30 ft.

 at-footed 22

Base Attack/Grapple: +12/+29

Attack:  Tentacle  +19  melee  (1d8+9  plus  1d6  electricity/19

20/3)

Full Attack: 3 tentacles +19 melee

(1d8+9 plus 1d6 electricity/19

Zeugalak

Extraction (Ex): If a urophion begins its turn

with at least one strand attached to a victim of

Huge size or smaller that is adjacent to it, it can

attempt to perform an extraction of the victims

brain as a full-round action. It must succeed on

a bite attack, dealing normal damage. It then

makes an immediate grapple attempt as a

free action without provoking attacks of

opportunity. If the urophion succeeds

on this check, it tears the victims skull

open and devours its brain, killing it

immediately.

Constructs,  elementals,  oozes,

plants,  and  undead  are  immune  to

extraction. Extraction is not instantly

fatal to foes with multiple heads.

Mind Blast (Sp): A urophion can

discharge a devastating psionic attack

in  the  form  of  a  cone  60  feet  long.

Anyone  caught  in  this  cone  must

succeed  on  a  DC  18  Will  save  or  be

stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC

is  Charisma-based.  This  ability  is  the

equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At willdetect thoughts

(DC 14), suggestion (DC 15). Caster level

12th.  The  save  DCs  are  Charisma-

based.

attempts to  ank it. It uses its breath weapon against those

who try to stay out of its melee reach.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A zeugalaks tentacles deal 3

damage on a successful critical hit.

Breath Weapon (Su): 100 ft. line, once every 1d4 rounds,

damage 12d6 electricity, Re ex DC 26 half. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Electrical  Aura  (Su):  A  zeugalaks  body  is  constantly

shrouded in an aura of electrical energy. Any creature that

successfully strikes a zeugalak with a melee weapon or natu-

ral weapon takes 1d6 points of electricity damage. Each of a

zeugalaks melee attacks deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity

damage on a hit. This additional damage is not multiplied on

a critical hit.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the zeugalak must

hit a creature that is at least two size categories smaller than

it with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple, it establishes a hold and can attempt to pin

the opponent in the following round.

Pinning  (Ex):  A  zeugalak  that  pins  an  opponent  with  a

claw deals claw damage (1d8+4) and twice its normal electric-

ity damage (2d6) in each round it maintains the pin. While

maintaining a pin with its claw, it can continue to attack other

Electrical  Af  nity  (Su):  A  zeugalak  takes  no  damage

from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack used against a

zeugalak (except for an electricity attack that originates from

a zeugalak) temporarily grants it 1d4 points of Dexterity. The

zeugalak loses these points at the rate of 1 per hour.

Electrical Teleportation (Su): If a zeugalak gains points to

its Dexterity from an electricity-based attack, it can instantly

teleport (as the spell greater teleport) to the source of the electri-

cal attack. This ability is a free action that does not provoke

attacks  of  opportunity  and  can  be  used  once  per  minute.

A  zeugalak  can  use  this  ability  even  on  another  creatures

This creature darts and weaves with shocking agility for some-

thing so massive. It has four saurian legs that each end in a single

massive talon. An incredibly long, whiplike stinger thrashes atop

the beast, and what must be its head consists of three tentacles

that  peel  back  to  expose  inner  surfaces  covered  with  hundreds

of sharklike teeth and a gaping circular maw. Arcs of electricity

dance  over  the  monsters  pale  blue  and  white  skin,  and  three

huge yellow eyes glare from above its mouth.

The dreaded zeugalak is a dangerous predator found on the

lower slopes of rugged mountains in tropical regions, although

it has been encountered in large underground regions as well.

A zeugalak isnt particularly intelligent, but it is nonetheless

a patient and observant monster that defends its chosen ter-

ritory quite  ercely.

A  zeugalak  is  a  nocturnal  creature,  although  sunlight

doesnt impede its sensitive eyesight. Zeugalaks are especially

active during thunderstorms, and cavort atop mountain peaks

during such weather. Their terrible bellows of delight when

they  are  struck  by  bolts  of  lightning  can  carry  for  miles.

When struck, they use their electrical teleportation ability

to teleport high into the clouds above so they can enjoy the

long feather fall back to the ground below through the sur-

rounding storm.

A zeugalak is about 26 feet long and weighs about 22,000

pounds.

COMBAT

A zeugalak is fond of initiating combat with a charge attack,

although it also uses feather fall to drop down on targets from

high  ledges.  Once  in  melee,  the  creature  splits  its  attacks

among all targets in reach, using its Combat Re exes and the

incredible reach of its stinger to disrupt spellcasters and any

iven  their  advantages  in  magical  lore,  physical

prowess, and sheer intellect, its perhaps surpris-

ing that master aberrations have not enslaved the

human world. Fortunately for humankind (and all

other  humanoid  races),  bold  and  determined  adventurers

devote their careers to checking the plots of these brood-

ing  monstrosities  and  exterminating  them  from  the  face

of the world.

In  addition  to  human  (and  humanoid)  crusaders  and

heroes,  other  races  stand  in  opposition  to  the  diabolical

plots of the mind  ayers and the depredations of behold-

erkind. Powerful good-aligned monsters such as metallic

dragons, fey, and outsiders recognize the threat posed by

evil aberrations and battle against them. Even neutral- or

evil-aligned  creatures  are  often  willing  to   ght  against

aberrations. A tribe of savage and cruel frost giants has no

particular interest in becoming slaves to aboleths or mind

 ayers, or in allowing these abominations to in ltrate and

corrupt the world.

While the would-be aberration hunter can find allies,

the  ultimate  defense  of  human  life,  welfare,  and  sanity

rests in human hands. Human (or dwarf, elf, gnome, or

halfling)  champions  who  discover  the  existence  of  an

aberration threat against their homeland face a dark and

dangerous campaign to drive back their foes. It is a war

fought in the deep places of the earth, in lightless dens

of unspeakable horror and madnessa war that deeply

scars champions who are skilled or lucky enough to

emerge victorious.

THE GREAT FOES

While  any  aberration  can  be  dangerous,  three  races

in  particularaboleths,  beholders,  and  mind   ay-

erspossess the combination of intelligence, magical

power, ambition, and numbers to pose a grave threat

to humankind and its allies. Dealing with a cloaker

infestation or grell nest is the work of a few adven-

tures.  On  the  other  hand,  halting  the  schemes  of

the aboleths or mind  ayers might take years, a long

and lonely task requiring special knowledge of the

enemy and speci c spells and magic items.

Characters who take up the crusade against these

ancient and monstrous evils must steel themselves

to deal with perils that most adventurers prefer not

to contemplate. Fates far worse than death wait in

the watery cities of the aboleths, the thrall-pens of the

mind  ayers, or the slave quarters of the neogi.

173

with a beholder is simply a question of assembling the right

resources in the right place. Beholders possess three advantages

that must be accounted for: the deadly eye rays, the antimagic

cone, and their ability to  y.

Dealing with the eye rays is dif cult, but not impossible.

The simplest method is to use antimagic  eld to render oneself

invulnerable to the direct effect of the eye rays, and then kill

the monsters with missile  re if they hover out of reach. If

no  spellcaster  in  the  party  can  cast  the  spell,  acquiring  a

scroll of antimagic  eld before confronting beholders is a wise

idea. This tactic has drawbacks: Not everyone can produce

an antimagic  eld on demand, the characters own magic cant

work as long as the party shelters within the  eld, and clever

beholders can still cause great damage by disintegrating the

ceiling overhead or using telekinesis to hurl heavy objects

into the antimagic  eld.

Without an antimagic  eld, attacking beholders becomes a

much more dangerous proposition. The best tactic is to limit

the number of eyes that can be used against the party. Instead

of surrounding the monsters, experienced beholder hunters

stay  closely  grouped  so  that  the  monsters  can  bring  only  a

few eye rays into play at a time. Anything that obscures

or limits vision is useful. A common smokestick

provides concealment that the beholders

antimagic  cone  cant

disperse,  while

ABOLETHS

Adventurers preparing to confront aboleths face three major

challenges: the monsters intelligence, their mental powers,

and their environment.

Aboleths  are  ruthless  geniuses.  They  do  not  overlook

weaknesses  in  their  defenses  and  they  easily  anticipate  an

enemys actions. They respond to threats with ef ciency and

guile, dispatching mind-controlled spies to learn the heroes

routines and vulnerabilities, using divination magic to monitor

the heroes activities, and concocting ruses and traps likely to

confuse or snare the heroes.

There is no good answer to aboleth intelligence, but at the

very minimum, an aboleth hunter should make use of magic

designed to obscure divinations such as nondetection, detect

scrying, and mind blank. Searching out humanoid minions

of the aboleths with spells such as detect thoughts or detect

magic is another sound tactic. Even people well known to the

heroes should be checked regularly to make sure that they

have not fallen under the sway of an aboleth master. Finally,

clever heroes could make a point of showing the aboleths

what they expect to see. Instead of killing or freeing a spy

known to be enslaved by the aboleths, the heroes could allow

the spy to continue her reports, carefully allowing her to

observe some activities and not others. Aboleths are smart

enough to see through such a tactic if it is not handled with

skill and subtlety.

Preparing to deal with the mental powers of the aboleths is

a key part of any successful expedition against the monsters.

Nothing can destroy a band of heroes quicker than having

a powerful  ghter switched from an ally to a foe by a spell

of mental domination. Any steps that improve a characters

Will save are virtually mandatory for an aboleth hunter.

Characters who expect to face aboleths would be well advised

to  take  the  Iron  Will  feat  at  the   rst  opportunity,  and  to

acquire  defensive  items  such  as  cloaks  of  resistance  if  at  all

possible. Use of the protection from evil spell exempli es a

particularly good tactic to employ against aboleths; a charac-

ter so protected cannot be made to attack his comrades.

The  third  dif culty  in  defeating  the  aboleths  lies

in their preferred environment, the cold and lightless

waters of the underground. Any aboleth seriously threat-

ened by land-bound attackers can simply retreat into the

dark depths of its lair. Spells such as water breathing and

freedom of movement are absolutely essential for cornering

aboleths that have chosen to retreat from a  ght. Polymorph

is another good tactic, as is using summon monster to conjure

an  aquatic  monster  that  can  go  where  the  heroes  cannot.

Without the ability to pursue aboleths into their submerged

lairs, aberration hunters  nd that the monsters are exceed-

ingly hard to  nish off.

BEHOLDERS

Despite  the  fact  that  they  are  individually  more

powerful than aboleths, beholders are in some ways

easier  foes to  combat. They lack the sheer genius,

organization, and minions of the aboleths; dealing

174

Protected by an

antimagic  eld, Mialee and Tordek

take the battle to a dreaded beholder

summoned air elementals can be directed to form whirlwinds

that create obscuring clouds of dust and debris.

Unlike the eye rays, not much can be done about the

antimagic cone. In some respects, arranging the  ght

in such a way that the beholders best move is to keep

the characters in the antimagic cone is a win

for the heroes, since it negates the peril of

the  eye  rays.  Heroes  hoping  to  use  magic

to  reach  or  strike  beholders  should  provide

themselves with a respectable nonmagical

ranged attack, just in caseheavy and

accurate archery  re can slay beholders

more easily than  ying characters

wielding magic swords.

The  beholders  abil-

ity  to   y  is  not

particularly

because their mental powers

allow  them  to  in ltrate  human-

oid  strongholds  or  settlements  and

quickly escape from dangerous situations.

Mind   ayers  are  also  quite  skilled  at  directing

their thralls to spy on and harass heroes in places of

supposed safety.

As with aboleths, there is no good answer to calculating,

pragmatic genius combined with inhuman evil. The illithid

hunter  should  take  steps  to  block  divinations  and  expose

mind  ayer thralls that might be spying on him, while doing

what he can to encourage illithid observers to see what they

expect to see.

It  is  absolutely  imperative  to  take  all  stops  possible  to

resist  the  mental  powers  of  mind  flayers  before  meeting

them  in  battle.  The  Iron  Will  feat  is  useful,  providing  a

potentially crucial edge in resisting  mind blast and other

mind-affecting  spells  and  abilities.  Unfortunately,  the

protection from evil spell does not negate a mind blast in the

same way it halts mental control; defending against mind

blast requires spell resistance, protection from spells, or the best

defense, spell immunity, which gives a character immunity to

any 4th-level spell or spell-like ability (such as mind blast).

Another useful tactic is to use summon monster to conjure

a creature that cant be stunned, such as an elemental, and

send the summoned creature against the mind flayers, or

simply command it to remain nearby and protect the party

in case characters are stunned.

MINIONS AND CULTISTS

Aberrations  command  the  allegiance  of  other  creatures,

ranging  from  horrible  monsters  nearly  as  bad  as  their

masters to human alienists or cultists. Master aberrations

are rarely encountered alone, since members of each of the

great races can easily enslave other creatures to their wills.

unique.  Few

creatures  can

both  y and deny their

opponents  the  same

ability, thougha tactic beholders

employ through the use of their antimagic

cones. Beholders build their lairs to take advantage

of this tactic by incorporating vertical shafts with

twists and turns just long enough for eye ray range, but not

long enough for them to be exposed to long-range missile  re

they cant return. Again, ranged weapons can reach beholders

that refuse to come into melee range.

MIND FLAYERS

Much like the aboleths, illithids are frighteningly intelligent,

coldly analytical, and armed with potent mental powers. They

do not enjoy the advantages an aquatic environment provides,

but they are even more personally dangerous than the aboleths

because of their horrible ability to kill stunned enemies by

extracting their brains.

Brilliant, ef cient, and completely unscrupulous, mind  ay-

ers are perfectly aware of their advantages and disadvantages in

battle, and they are capable of anticipating the heroes actions

with uncanny accuracy. They are more inclined to personally

investigate and scout hero parties than aboleths are, simply

Symbols of (1) the Great Mother, (2) Ilsennsine, (3) Ghaunadaur, (4) Tharizdun, (5) the Patient One, and (6) Mak Thuum Ngatha

Minions and allies offer clever aberrations the opportunity

to overcome their innate vulnerabilities or weaknesses by

capturing  creatures  whose  strengths  complement  their

own. For example, landgoing slaves of the aboleths allow

the deep masters to strike at enemies far from the under-

ground seas where the aboleths lurk, while neogi enslave

umber hulks to make up for their own small stature and

weak fighting ability.

The majority of aberration minions are thralls, humanoid

slaves  who  serve  as  forced  labor,  guards,  and  occasionally

meals for their masters. In any normal setting, the thralls of

the aboleths or mind  ayers would rebel or  ee rather than

continue in perpetual servitude, but the master aberrations

have  millennia  of  experience  in  managing  their  captive

populations. They learned long ago that slaves can be divided

against each other by creating a class of overseers that stand

above the rest. It is not even necessary to keep all the slaves

or overseers charmed or dominated all the time. A few powerful

individuals under mental control can go a long way toward

keeping the rank-and- le under the lash, and truly intractable

slaves are simply consumed at the earliest opportunity.

Whenever possible, aberrations with the innate ability to

charm or dominate others enslave powerful monsters as well

as  humanoids.  These  creatures  are  rarely  left  uncontrolled,

since they might possess the strength to escape or turn on

their masters if freed of their mental shackles.

Unlike thralls, who rarely choose their fate, cultists will-

ingly treat with monsters that regard humanoids as prey or

vermin.  Even  the  most  avaricious  or  cruel  humans  value

their own humanity to some extent, but aberrant cultists and

fanatics  embrace  nihilism,  madness,  and  self-obliteration.

Even by the standards of truly evil people, cultists of this

sort are abhorrent.

Horri c  deities  such  as  Ghaunadaur  or  Tharizdun  offer

power to humans or humanoids willing to ignore the risks

inherent in dealing with such divinities. The most depraved

cults include both aberration and humanoid followers. The

humanoids  serve  as  spies,  guards,  and  assassins,  while  the

aberrations provide frightening magical and physical power

to back up their humanoid comrades. A coven of beholder

cultists that worships a living beholder extends the monsters

reach into the heart of any human community nearby, making

it dif cult for adventurers opposing the monster to surprise

it in its lair.

It is a bitter truth that aberration hunters must begin their

quests by  ghting and killing otherwise blameless creatures

compelled  to  serve  evil  masters.  Unfortunately,  it  is  often

impossible to tell whether a particular minion or guardian

serves because it is rewarded by its masters with power over

other thralls, because it regards its situation as hopeless and

is only trying to survive, or because it is magically compelled

to its duty.

UNHUMAN GODS

Aberrations have an entirely different notion of divinity from

that of humanoids. Human cultures perceive a discontinuity

between mortal and divine, a dividing line as vast and impass-

able as a great ocean. Master aberrations, on the other hand,

regard their divine patrons as exemplars of their kindolder

siblings that have achieved divine power through age, knowl-

edge, and fearlessness. Every aboleth believes that it holds the

potential to achieve godhood, or something very much like it,

with suf cient study.

Those  who  battle  master  aberrations  must  confront  dark

cults, mad priests, and ancient, hungry horrors in the shape

of gods.

Ghaunadaur

Also known as That Which Lurks or the Elder Eye, Ghaunadaur

is a primordial deity of Faern, the world of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS  campaign  setting.  It  is  the  lord  of  oozes,  slimes,

and  nameless  underground  monstrosities  that  slither  and

seep through the lightless places of the world. Aboleths and

renegade drow seek its divine power, but Ghaunadaur is an

unpredictable patron at best. It might reward casual worshipers

by granting great boons, or it might devour or maim its own

high priests without warning.

Ghaunadaur  is  nominally  considered  part  of  the  drow

pantheon, but in truth the Elder Eye is simply a dark power of

the deep underground. All who venture there would be wise

to respect its hunger.

Ghaunadaurs symbol is a purple eye on a black circle.

The Great Mother

Progenitor of beholders, gibbering orbs (Epic Level Handbook

page 191), and less well-known aberrations, the Great Mother

exists to  ll the multiverse with its offspring. By replacing all

other creatures with monsters spawned in its own image, the

Great  Mother  intends  to  remake  the  multiverse.  Beholders

believe  that  the  Great  Mothers  mind  encompasses  all  the

knowledge in the cosmos, and in fact the Great Mother pos-

sesses secrets and lore that no other creature knows. However,

the entity comprehends so much that it is virtually impossible

for  it  to  communicate  with  beings  that  lack  nigh-in nite

knowledge themselves. Students of the monstrous gods believe

that the Great Mother is hopelessly insanewhereas in truth

they simply lack the intelligence to perceive the reason in the

beholder gods actions.

Some  human  cultists  revere  beholders  as  deities  in  their

own right; the Great Mother answers their supplications on

behalf of her spawn, thus perpetuating the cultists belief in

the divinity of the beholder race.

The Great Mothers symbol is an eye in an egg.

Ilsensine

Deity of the mind  ayers, Ilsensine is a cold and calculating

being  that  embodies  the  illithid  ideals  of  mental  prowess,

in nite knowledge, and purposeful dominion over all other

forms of life. Ilsensine manifests as a disembodied brain of

emerald hue that trails countless ganglionic tentacles through

the in nite planes. It gathers information from all worlds and

planes simultaneously, learning every secret and perceiving

every thought.

Ilsensines symbol is a stylized illithid face with four  mouth-

tentacles, rendered in jade green.

Mak Thuum Ngatha

The Nine-Tongued Worm is an entity of the Far Realm. Unlike

many  of  the  terrible  and  powerful  creatures  that  dwell  in

the mindless chaos of the Far Realm, Mak Thuum Ngatha is

interested in the Material Plane. Psurlons, tsochari, and nilshai

(Unapproachable East page 67) pay the Nine-Tongued Worm

homage, but it has few worshipers among other races; only a

handful of alienists, cultists, and half-farspawn monstrosities

even know of its existence. No being outside the Far Realm

can say what the Nine-Tongued Worms desires or goals might

be, but they are certainly inimical to every living creature on

the Material Plane.

Several  other  entities  of  similar  power  and  disposition

exist  in  the  Far  Realm,  some  with  their  own  cultists  and

adherents.

Mak Thuum Ngathas symbol is a fan-shaped glyph of nine

squiggly lines.

The Patient One

The terrible divine entity known only as the Patient One is

patron to a number of aberration races such as aboleths, cloak-

ers, chuuls, avolakias (Monster Manual II page 28), and other

monsters. It waits and watches in the darkness, whispering

sibilant secrets to the shadows, until it is time to feed on the

humanoid sacri ces its worshipers offer. The Patient One is an

old and alien divinity, an elder power similar to Ghaunadaur

or Tharizdun. It is possible that these terrible dark powers are

The symbol of the Patient One is a mouth surrounded by

Tharizdun

An  old  and  evil  god  of  uncertain  origin,  Tharizdun  was

imprisoned  long  ago  by  the  concerted  effort  of  all  of  the

human gods. He is a power of darkness, decay, entropy, and

ruin that seeks nothing less than the unraveling of the entire

universe. His adherents believe that Tharizdun will grant them

great favors when he remakes the world. Hateful aberrations

that dream of the destruction of the human world sometimes

proffer worship to this dark deity, and some say that Tharizdun

hails from the Far Realm or the dim memories of an earlier

universeorigins that suggest an af liation with extraplanar

or extratemporal creatures such as aboleths, cloakers, grell,

psurlons, or similar monsters.

Tharizduns symbol is a dark spiral.

FEATS FOR THE

ABERRATION HUNTER

Aberration races have threatened humanoid societies through-

out history. In response to this threat, those who resist these

monstrosities  and  take  the   ght  to  their  secret  lairs  have

learned special tricks and talents to aid their efforts.

ABERRANT FEATS

This  book  adds  a  new  feat  type:  the  aberrant  feat.  Unlike

typical  feats,  aberrant  feats  manifest  as  physical  changes to

your characters features (or as additions to your characters

appearance). These feats twist and reshape your form, and you

become alien in appearance.

A character who has selected at least one aberrant feat gains

an inhuman, unsettling presence. You take a 1 penalty on

Diplomacy,  Disguise,  Gather  Information,  Handle  Animal,

and wild empathy checks for every aberrant feat you possess

(2 with two feats, 3 with three feats, and so on).

Some aberrant feats have an additional cumulative effect

based on your total number of aberrant feats. This accumulation

increases as you gain additional aberrant feats. For example,

a character with Aberration Blood who selects Durable Form

gains 4 hit points (two for each aberrant feat he possesses). If

he later selects Bestial Hide, he gains another 2 hit points (in

addition to the normal bene t of Bestial Hide).

ABERRATION BANEMAGIC

You can cast spells that do additional damage to aberrations.

Bene  t:  When  you  cast  a  spell  that  deals  damage  to  an

aberration, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage.

A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than

once per casting. For instance, a  reball deals the extra damage

to all aberrations in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level

wizard  casts  magic  missile  and  produces  two  missiles,  only

one of them (of the wizards choice) gains the extra damage,

whether or not both missiles are directed at the same aberration

or two different aberrations. If a spell deals damage for more

than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round.

Scrolls scribed by you do not gain any bene t from Aberra-

tion Banemagic. Scrolls activated by you also gain no bene t

from Aberration Banemagic. The same is true for most other

magic  items,  such  as  wands  and  potions.  However,  staffs

activated by you use not only your caster level but also gain

the bene t of this feat, if applicable.

If  the  spell  allows  a  saving  throw,  the  DC  of  the  saving

throw  increases  by  2.  The  additional  damage  dealt  by  this

spell is either halved on a successful saving throw or negated

entirely, depending on how the regular damage dealt by the

spell is affected by a successful saving throw.

ABERRATION BLOOD [ABERRANT]

One of your ancestors was an aberration and has passed the

taint of its aberrant physiology down through the generations

to you. This taint manifests physically in your appearance in

some noticeable way.

Prerequisite: Humanoid.

Bene  t: You gain a physical feature that grants you a racial

bonus on one type of check; once you select the check to which

this bonus applies (as well as the corresponding feature) you

cannot change it later. The bonus must be chosen from the

following list:

Aberrant Feature

Bulging eyes

Flexible limbs

Segmented eyes

Slimy skin

Sticky fingers

Tail

Webbed hands

Benefit

+2 bonus on Spot checks

+2 bonus on Grapple checks

+3 bonus on Search checks

+4 bonus on Escape Artist checks

+3 bonus on Climb checks

+4 bonus on Balance checks

+4 bonus on Swim checks

Special: You can select this feat more than once. Each time

you select this feat, choose a different aberrant feature and gain

the bonus associated with it.

ABERRATION WILD SHAPE

[ABERRANT]

Most druids detest aberrations and think of them as outside

nature, but some view them simply as examples of nature from

an extreme and alien world. Thanks to your heritage, you are

one of these latter, and have learned to channel your inhuman

bloodline into your shapeshifting power.

Prerequisites: Aberration Blood, wild shape ability.

Bene  t: You can use your wild shape ability to assume the

form of an aberration. This otherwise functions identically

to your normal wild shape ability. The size of the aberration

is limited by the size of animal you can normally assume the

shape of with wild shape.

AQUATIC SPELLCASTING

of water.

Bene  t: Water does not impede your spells. Crea-

tures partially or completely submerged do not gain

cover or total cover when you cast a spell from outside

the water. The surface does not block line of effect for any

spell, including spells with the  re descriptor. You need not

make a Spellcraft check to cast a  re spell underwater.

Normal:  Partially  or  completely  submerged

creatures  gain  improved  or  total  cover  against

attacks from land. The water surface blocks line

of  effect  for   re  spells.  Fire  spells  do  not  func-

tion underwater unless the caster succeeds on a

Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).

BESTIAL HIDE [ABERRANT]

Your skin is thicker, scalier, or furrier than normal.

Prerequisite: Aberration Blood.

Bene  t: Your natural armor bonus to AC improves

by 1 for every two aberrant feats you possess.

DARKSTALKER

You have learned how to stalk and surprise creatures

whose  senses  are  very  different  from  those  of  a

humanoid.

Bene  t: When you hide, creatures with blind-

sense,  blindsight,  scent,  or  tremorsense  must

make a Listen check or a Spot check (whichever DC

is higher) to notice you, just as sighted creatures would make

Spot checks to detect you. You cannot hide in plain sight unless

you have that ability as a class feature. In addition, you can  ank

creatures that have the all-around vision special quality.

Normal: Creatures with these senses do not need to make

Spot or Listen checks to notice other creatures within range.

Creatures with all-around vision cant be  anked.

DEEPSPAWN [ABERRANT]

The  abnormalities  of  your  aberration-tainted  heritage

grow more pronounced. Your body undergoes a shock-

ing degeneration into something that is strikingly

inhuman.

Prerequisites: Aberration Blood, one other

aberrant feat.

Bene  t: Two  short  but  powerful

tentacles sprout from your waist. You

gain  two  tentacle  natural  attacks

that each deal 1d4 points of damage

(for a Medium creature) plus your

Strength modi er. The tentacle

attacks are treated as primary

weapons.

You can attack with weapons

and also make tentacle attacks,

but  your  tentacle  attacks  are

treated  as  secondary  weapons:

The  attacks  are  made  with  a  5

penalty on the attack roll, and you add only 1/2 your Strength

bonus to the damage roll.

You gain a +2 racial bonus on grapple checks.

DURABLE FORM [ABERRANT]

You are much more resilient than the fragile humanoids that

do not share your aberrant heritage.

Prerequisite: Aberration Blood.

Bene  t: You gain 2 hit points for each aberrant feat you

have.

INHUMAN REACH [ABERRANT]

Your arms elongate, allowing you to touch the  oor with your

hands. In addition, you can bend them in strange and unnatu-

ral ways. The arms may vary in appearance, perhaps seeming

scaly and snakelike, or slimy like tentacles; conversely, they

may resemble normal but longer arms with a second elbow

joint. Unless you wear a large cloak to conceal these deformi-

ties, you are disturbing to behold.

Prerequisite: Aberration Blood.

Bene  t: You gain an additional 5 feet of reach. For most

Small and Medium creatures, this bene t increases natural

reach to 10 feet. If you already have a reach of more than 5

feet for some reason, this feat extends your reach by another 5

feet. As described on page 112 of the Players Handbook, a reach

weapon doubles your normal reach; for example, if you have

this feat and you wield a longspear, you can attack targets 15

or 20 feet away. Your elongated arms also grant you a +2 bonus

on Climb checks.

Special: Due to the dis gured nature of your new limbs,

you take a 1 penalty on all melee attack rolls.

INHUMAN VISION [ABERRANT]

You possess the inhuman eyes of some strange creature. They

might look segmented or larger or without pupils. You might

even have eyestalks.

Prerequisite: Aberration Blood.

Bene  t: You gain a racial bonus on Spot checks equal to the

number of aberrant feats you possess.

The range of your darkvision improves by 5 feet for every

aberrant feat that you possess.

If you do not already have darkvision, you gain darkvision

out to 5 feet for each aberrant feat you possess.

180

MUSIC OF THE OUTER SPHERES

You can use your bardic music to create discordant, insane

sounds.  This  music  is  particularly  effective  against  aberra-

tions, and can sicken them, vitalize them, or  ll them with

lethargy.

Prerequisites: Perform (any) 11 ranks, bard level 9th.

Bene  t: You can now use the following additional bardic

music abilities.

Lull  Aberration  (Sp):  You  must  target  a  single  aberration

within 30 feet with this ability. You can target an additional

aberration for every three bard levels above 9th that you pos-

sess. A targeted aberration must make a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 bards level + bards Cha modi er) or become lethargic and

partially hypnotized by the discordant sounds of your perfor-

mance. Affected aberrations are slowed, as per the spell.

Sicken Aberration (Sp): Any aberration within a 30-foot spread

centered on you must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10

+ 1/2 bards level + bards Cha modi er) or become sickened

for as long as you continue to use this ability. If an aberration

makes  this  saving  throw,  it  does  not  have  to  make  another

saving throw to avoid becoming sickened unless you activate

this ability again.

Vitalize  Aberration  (Sp):  All  aberrations  within  a  30-foot

spread centered on you gain a +2 morale bonus to all special

attack and spell-like ability save DCs and a +1 dodge bonus to

Armor Class.

OCULAR SPELL [METAMAGIC]

Your study of the terrible powers of the beholder has given you

insight into new ways to prepare and cast spells.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (dungeoneering) 4 ranks, two

or more eyes.

Bene  t: You can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 full

round or less as an ocular spell. An ocular spell does not take

effect immediately, but is instead held in one of your eyes for up

to 8 hours. You can store only two ocular spells in this fashion,

even if you have more than two eyes. Only ray spells and spells

with a target other than personal can be cast as ocular spells.

When you choose, you can then cast both of the ocular spells

as a full-round action; the spells become brilliant blasts that

shoot out from your eyes. You can choose different targets for

the two ocular spells.

When you release an ocular spell, its effect changes to a ray

with a range of up to 60 feet. If the spell previously would have

affected multiple creatures, it now affects only the creature

struck by the ray. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack

to strike your target with an ocular spell, and the target is still

permitted any saving throw allowed by the spell.

Example: Ferno, an 11th-level wizard with the Ocular Spell

feat,  could  prepare  two  scorching  ray  spells  as  ocular  spells,

casting them at the beginning of the day. In combat, he can

take a full-round action to  re off both scorching ray spells. He

can  re each spell at a different target, and he gets all three

rays from each spell.

An ocular spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than

the spells actual level.

PARRYING SHIELD

You have studied advanced techniques for battling foes whose

attacks normally bypass armor. You use your shield to block

or de ect rays and other touch attacks.

Prerequisite: Shield pro ciency.

Bene  t:  You  gain  your  shield  bonus  (and  the  shields

enhancement bonus, if any) as an addition to your touch AC.

Special: A  ghter can select Parrying Shield as one of his

 ghter bonus feats (see Players Handbook page 38).

QUICK RECOVERY

Its hard to keep you down for long. You have a talent for shak-

ing off effects that leave others unable to act.

Bene  t: Whenever you begin your turn stunned or dazed,

you can make a new saving throw at the original DC of the

effect  that  stunned  or  dazed  you  in  an  attempt  to  recover.

Recovering from being stunned or dazed in this way is a move

action. If the effect that caused you to become stunned or dazed

did not allow a saving throw, you can recover by succeeding

on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 HD or caster level of originator of

effect + relevant ability modi er, or Cha modi er if there is

not an obvious ability linked to the effect).

Normal: You are stunned or dazed as long as the effect calls

for, and do not have an opportunity to recover early.

SCAVENGING GULLET [ABERRANT]

The taint of the aberration in your blood has gifted you with

the ability to gain nourishment from things that others would

never consider as food.

Prerequisite: Aberration Blood.

Bene  t:  You  gain  nourishment  from  eating  any  organic

material, despite its freshness or source.

You gain a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves to resist the

effect  of  ingested  poisons,  as  well  as  on  Fortitude  saves  to

resist diseases caused by ingested substances (such as spoiled

food).

STARSPAWN [ABERRANT]

Your  abnormal  body  and  heritage  has  become  more  pro-

nounced. You grow membranous wings and are comfortable

in extreme elevations.

Prerequisites: Aberration Blood, one other aberrant feat.

Bene  t: You gain a  y speed (with average maneuverability)

equal to one-half your base land speed (round down to the

nearest 5-foot increment). You can use your  ight for a number

of consecutive rounds equal to 1 + your Constitution modi er

(minimum 1 round); between these uses you cannot  y for 1

round.

You gain resistance to cold 5. You are immune to altitude

fatigue and altitude sickness.

THRALL BRED

You were spawned in the breeding pits of the mind  ayers

or the beholders. You were bred for unusual strength, hardi-

ness, and loyalty to your unhuman masters, and you can now

choose to bestow your loyalty on other worthy masters.

Prerequisites: Humanoid, Con 13.

Benefit: When you are within 30 feet of the individual

you have designated as your special charge, you gain a +1

morale bonus on damage rolls and saving throws. If your

special charge is not within 30 feet, or is dead or incapaci-

tated,  you  take  a  2  morale  penalty  on  damage  rolls  and

saving throws.

You can designate a special charge only once per month. If

your charge dies or abandons you, you take the morale penalty

until you have the opportunity to choose a new charge (or

choose to have no special charge at all).

Your charge must have more Hit Dice than you.

WARPED MIND [ABERRANT]

Your tainted form has altered the physical nature of your brain,

making you resistant to mental effects and more capable of

unleashing the power of your mind on others.

Prerequisite: Aberration Blood.

Bene  t: You gain a racial bonus on Will saves against mind-

affecting spells and abilities equal to one-half the number of

aberrant feats you possess.

You gain 1 psionic power point for each aberrant feat you

possess.

WATERSPAWN [ABERRANT]

Your  abnormal  body  and  heritage  has  become  more  pro-

nounced.  You  have  prominent   ns  and  are  supremely  well

adapted to the icy deeps.

Prerequisites: Aberration Blood, one other aberrant feat.

Bene  t: You gain a Swim speed equal to your land speed.

This also grants you a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks, the

ability to take 10 on any Swim check, and the ability to use

the run action while swimming.

You gain resistance to cold 5. You can breathe air and water

with equal ease.

WILD TALENT

Your  mind  wakes  to  a  previously  unrealized  talent  for

psionics.

Bene  t: Your latent power of psionics  ares to life, con-

ferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As

a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and

can  take  psionic  feats,  metapsionic  feats,  and  psionic  item

creation  feats  (see  the  Expanded  Psionics  Handbook).  You  do

not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by

virtue of having this feat.

PICKING A PRESTIGE CLASS

Few heroes make a career out of hunting aberrationsfor

long, anyway. Embarking on a crusade to eradicate the aboleth

or mind  ayer threat all too often proves to be the last thing

a hero does. Those who survive are the toughest, smartest,

and most resolute of characters. They rarely succeed in their

ultimate  goal,  but  without  such  heroes  to   ght  thankless

battles in the darkness, who can say what horrors might creep

into the world above?

Combat-Focused:  These  prestige  classes  are  particu-

larly  good  at  fighting  with  weapons,  whether  natural  or

manufactured.

Strong Spellcasting: Prestige classes on this list are good

choices for spellcasters who want their progress toward higher

levels of magic to be uninterrupted (or nearly so).

Moderate  Spellcasting:  This  prestige  class  doesnt  get

top-notch spells quickly, but it has other abilities to make up

for the reduced progress.

Psionics: This prestige class relies on rules presented in

the Expanded Psionics Handbook.

Tied to Aberration Secrets: This prestige class often deals

with aberrations to acquire more power and in uence.

Sneaky:  This  prestige  class  relies  on  skills,  stealth,  and

guile to be successful. While not combat-oriented or magical

in nature, it has plenty of special abilities.

ABOLISHER

I have tracked the foul illithid cult for many months now, have waded

through the brainless dead they leave in their wake and the empty

settlements from which they have recruited their thralls. Yet each

time, they leave behind clues to their weaknesses and hints to their

goals, and soon indeed I shall be ready to end their lives in the only

way they deserve. When I am done, nothing shall remain, not even

the memory of their taint. They shall not haunt the camp re tales of

children. It shall be as if they never were.

Aurah Lirilian, Circle of the True

The abolisher is more than merely a devoted servant of the

natural  world.  She  is  a  crusader  against  that  which  taints,

usurps, and replaces the ordered nature of things with alien

desires and monstrous needs. She opposes aberrations with all

her will and might in a constant battle to preserve what is pure

in nature from that which lurks beyond the rim of sanity.

BECOMING AN ABOLISHER

Although the ranger class provides the easiest path to becom-

ing an abolisher, most abolishers favor the druid class since it

enhances spellcasting and the wild shape class feature. Rarest

are those characters who possess only one level of druid or

ranger, yet focus the majority of their time in other classes.

No barbarian abolishers exist, since all abolishers oppose the

terrible chaos that personi es the taint of the Far Realm, and

cannot allow even the slightest hint of such chaos into their

own hearts. Wisdom (for divine spellcasting and observational

skills,  and  to  aid  in  resisting  the  terrible  mental  attacks  of

aberrations),  Charisma  (for  the  various  special  abolisher

abilities), and Strength (to better  ght against the enemy) are

key abilities.

Entry Requirements

Type: Cannot be an aberration.

Alignment: Any nonchaotic.

Skills: Knowledge (dungeoneering) 4 ranks, Knowledge

(nature) 9 ranks.

Feat: Track.

Special: Wild empathy class feature.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the abolisher prestige

class.

Spellcasting: At each level except 1st and 6th, you gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells

known,  if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  a

divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding

the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an

abolisher, you must decide to which class to add each level for

the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and

spells known.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, your hatred of aberrations

grants you a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and

Survival checks when using these skills against aberrations.

Likewise, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against

such creatures.

At 4th level, and then again at 8th level, this bonus increases

by 2. If you possess the favored enemy (aberrations) feature

from another source, these bonuses stack.

Wild Shape (Su): You gain the druid ability to use wild

shape once per day. Your abolisher wild shape is somewhat

more limited than a full druids wild shape ability, though,

and you are limited to Medium animals. The ability otherwise

works as detailed on page 37 of the Players Handbook.

As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this ability per

day. At 4th level, you can use wild shape two times per day, and

at 8th level you can do so three times per day. If you already

have wild shape uses from another class, such as druid, these

wild shape uses stack.

If you have druid levels, each time you gain a level of abol-

isher, you add 1 to your effective druid level to determine the

maximum Hit Dice of a creature you can wild shape into and

how long each use of wild shape lasts. The type and size of

animal that you can wild shape into does not improve from

abolisher levels.

Animal Companion: If you have an animal companion,

your  abolisher  levels  stack  with  your  previous  class  levels

(usually druid or ranger) to determine the animal companions

abilities. If you do not already have an animal companion, you

do not gain one from this ability.

Winds of Natures Grace (Ex): At 2nd level and higher,

you gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks

from aberrations. The bonus increases to match your Charisma

bonus, if any (minimum of +2) when you use wild shape or other

magic to assume the form of an animal, elemental, or plant.

Pierce Aberrant Defense (Ex): Many aberrations possess

some degree of spell resistance, and abolishers train to over-

come this spell resistance. Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1

bonus on caster level checks made to overcome an aberrations

spell resistance. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, and then

to +3 at 9th level. These bonuses stack with those granted by

the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats.

Crystals of Natures Wrath (Su): At 5th level and higher,

your  wild  shape  natural  attacks  are  enhanced  with  jagged

crystals. These crystals are harmless to most creatures, but to

aberrations they cause terrible welts and acidlike burns. An

aberration struck by one of your natural weapons must make

a Fortitude save (DC 10 + abolisher level + Cha modi er) or

become sickened for 1 minute. An aberration that makes its

saving throw is immune to this effect for the duration of that

use of wild shape.

Waves  of  Natures  Purity  (Su):  Beginning  at  7th  level,

you can create a rippling aura of white vapor that spreads in

a 20-foot radius. The vapor does not obscure vision, and it is

cool and refreshing against the skin of nonaberrations. Against

aberrations, the waves of natures purity are foul and unsettling.

An affected aberration must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

abolisher level + Cha modi er) each round or become nause-

ated for that round. You can use this ability once per day, and

the power lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma

modi er (minimum 1 round). Activating this ability is a stan-

dard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Fires of Natures Rage (Su): A 10th level, you can infuse

your wild shape form with  ickering ghostly  re three times

per  day.  The   res  of  natures  rage  burn  any  aberration  that

comes in contact with them. Your natural attacks do an extra

3d6 points of  re damage against aberrations, and an aberra-

tion that hits you, even with a weapon, takes 3d6 points of  re

damage. You can activate the  res of natures wrath as a free

action, as long as you are in wild shape form. Doing so does

not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each activation lasts

for 1 round.

PLAYING AN ABOLISHER

An abolisher is grim, determined, and often pessimistic. You

remain devoted to your cause at all times, but the fact  that

your enemies are so ancient and powerful weighs upon your

soul. This realization, combined with the fact that you and

your fellow abolishers see aberrations at their worst and most

mind-numbing, tends to leave most abolishers cold, distant,

and dif cult to befriend.

Combat

quickly  that  way.  Against  beholders,  its  probably  best  to

assume the form of Small (or Tiny) animals, since the size

and Dexterity bonuses to your Armor Class help you avoid

their eye ray attacks.

If you are of good alignment, the few good-aligned aberra-

tions (such as silthilar; see page 168) pose a great dif culty to

you. Some good-aligned abolishers are comfortable with simply

forcing good-aligned aberrations to relocate, but others take

pity on such creatures and do what they can to remove the taint

of the aberration from them. Some good-aligned abolishers

merely observe good-aligned aberrations closely to make sure

they dont cause trouble, while others have gone so far as to

convince a good-aligned aberration to voluntarily submit to a

reincarnation spell. Ultimately, how you react to good-aligned

aberrations is something you must decide for yourself.

Advancement

Although you dont have to take any druid levels to qualify

for the abolisher prestige class, the fact that so many of your

powers as an abolisher are tied to the wild shape ability means

that you should at least consider taking a few druid levels to

augment this feature. Reaching at least 5th level as a druid

before taking abolisher levels works best, since your abolisher

levels eventually grant you an effective bonus of +3 to your

druid level for the purpose of determining how many times

per day you can use your wild shape ability.

If you dont have it already, you should take the Natural Spell

feat as soon as possible so you can spend the majority of your

time in wild shape form and still be able to cast spells. Since

many aberrations have spell resistance, Spell Penetration and

Greater  Spell  Penetration  are  good  choices  as  feats  as  well.

Combat feats that can be used in wild shape form are useful

too, especially feats such as Improved Grapple and Weapon

Finesse if you prefer to wild shape into dexterous creatures.

Spend your earnings on items that are equally useful to you

in wild shape form as they are in your natural form. Armor with

the wild special ability (see page 219 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide)  and  ioun  stones  are  obvious  choices,  as  are  animated

wooden shields. A druids vestment is helpful as well, since it

directly augments your wild shape ability.

Abolishers live to  ght aberrations. When you face an aber-

ration  in  combat,  you  should  do  everything  in  your  power

to defeat the creature. Since you have fewer hit points and a

lower base attack bonus than a  ghter, though, you want to be

careful about engaging in melee with aberrations, especially

since many of them have dangerous special attacks.

An  abolisher  is  strongest  in  a   ght  while  in  wild  shape,

and you should take advantage of this fact by spending much

of your time in the form of an animal (or plant, if you can)

selected for its capabilities against the kind of aberration you

expect to  ght. For example, if youre going after aboleths,

the form of a shark or a squid might work best. On the other

hand, if youre  ghting mind  ayers, some fast creature that

has several attacks, such as a deinonychus or tiger, is a good

choice; you can get up close and tear into an illithid more

Resources

The Circle of the True is your best resource as an abolisher.

You dont need to establish an allegiance to this group before

you take your  rst abolisher level, but a representative of the

group  should  contact  you  before  you  reach  3rd  level  if  you

dont seek one out yourself. As a member of the Circle, you

have access to more information about aberration activity in

the area, as well as emotional and logistical support from a

group of like-minded individuals.

ABOLISHERS IN THE WORLD

Abolishers are solitary individuals for the most part, gathering

together only occasionally for meetings of the Circle of the

True. The PCs have a greater chance of encountering abolish-

ers the more they  ght against aberrations, and if they build a

reputation as aberration-slayers, they might even be contacted

by the Circle with an offer to join its ranks. A less likely way

that the PCs can run into an abolisher is if they or one of their

allies  or  cohorts  is  an  aberration;  in  this  case,  an  abolisher

serves as a powerful and dangerous enemy.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can learn

important details about powerful abolishers and the Circle of

the True in your campaign, including the names of powerful

members and locations of hidden bases of operation.

ABOLISHERS IN THE GAME

Organization

With the exception of the Circle of the

True, abolishers operate on their own in

the  world,  focusing  their  attentions  on

the unsettled wildlands where aberrations

more easily hide. See page 217 for details

about the Circle of the True.

NPC Reactions

Most  people  dont  rec-

ognize  an  abolisher  for

what she is on sight, and

assume  simply  that  she

is  a  particularly  moody

and humorless druid. Other

abolishers,  as  well  as  keepers

of the Cerulean Sign (see page

194), immediately recognize her

for what she is, though, and have a

starting attitude of friendly toward her.

Likewise, an abolishers body language and

tone of voice make it very dif cult for her to

get along well with aberrations, and they have a

starting attitude of hostile toward an abolisher

as  a  result.  Even  those  who  would  not  normally

wish her harm rarely, if ever, have a starting attitude

better than unfriendly.

ABOLISHER

LORE

Characters

with

Knowl-

edge (nature)

can  research

abolishers  to

learn more about

them.  When  a  character

makes  a  skill  check,  read  or  paraphrase

the following, including the information

from lower DCs.

Aurah Lirilian, an abolisher

DC 10: Abolishers are druids who have dedicated their lives

to  ghting and slaying aberrations.

DC 15: Abolishers are accomplished shapechangers. They

know  a  vast  amount  of  information  about  aberrations,  and

are valuable allies to have on your side if you plan on  ghting

aberrations.

DC 20: Most abolishers belong to a group called the Circle

of the True. This group aids those who arent abolishers, as long

as they oppose aberrant creatures.

This prestige class is naturally tied to the amount of

aberration activity in your campaign. If aberrations

are rare or absent from your world, abolishers wont

have a place there. If, on the other hand, youre

running an aberration-heavy game, abolishers

might be one of the most powerful organizations

in  the  world,  perhaps  even  the  power  behind

the throne.

In  the  standard  D&D  world,  aberrations

are fairly prevalent but operate behind the

scenes  or  in  distant  locations.  In  this

case,  an  abolisher  should  be  equally

subtle  and  obscure.  Its  not  hard  to

envision  a  city  locked  in  a  mortal  war

between the abolishers and a hidden cult of neogi

slavers in the sewers below, while only a few of

the citys citizens ever suspect that such a war

is going on around them.

Adaptation

If you dont feature aberrations in your game, its

a fairly simple matter to adapt the abolisher to be

a devoted enemy of another kind of creature. You

should make sure to select this replace-

ment favored enemy with care; undead,

evil  outsiders,  and  giants  are

all  good  examples,  since

these  types  of  crea-

tures  work  in  large

groups and

are  usu-

ally  evil.

Animals,

constructs,

elementals,

magical

beasts, oozes,

pl a nt s ,  a nd

vermin  are  poor

choices, since these creatures tend to be

unintelligent  and  unorganized.  Dragons,  fey,  humanoids,

and monstrous humanoids might make interesting choices,

although since each of these creature types has a fairly even

spread  among  alignments,  you  should  focus  the  abolisher

in this case on a speci c kind of creature such as kobolds,

minotaurs, or red dragons. If you do so, make sure that this

creature is encountered enough in your campaign so that the

abolishers have something to  ght against.

A sample abolisher appears in the description of the Circle

of the True on page 217.

Darkrunners devote their lives to traveling the haunted under-

ground depths. Some hire out their services as guides to those

who wish to navigate the lightless ways, while others are lone

wolves who simply wish to explore the deepest reaches of this

wondrous and dangerous realm. They understand the lay of

the subterranean world like no other, and use its terrain and

features to great advantage in combat.

BECOMING A DARKRUNNER

The ranger class is the easiest path to becoming a darkrun-

ner. Despite having to take cross-class ranks in Knowledge

(dungeoneering),  barbarians  and  druids  both  can  qualify

fairly quickly (unless they multiclass into a class that has this

as a class skill). Intelligence is perhaps the most important

ability  for  a  darkrunner,  since  it  grants  bonus  skill  points

and enhances several of the darkrunners class features. After

Intelligence, Charisma and Dexterity are likely the best abili-

ties for a darkrunner, since both contribute to many of the

characters class skills.

Due to the darkvision requirement, most darkrunners come

from  races  already  adapted  to  underground  life  (dwarves,

half-orcs, drow, and the like). Creatures with the Aberration

Blood and Inhuman Vision feats might also  nd surprising

welcome in the Darkrunner Guild.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Knowledge (dungeoneering) 5 ranks, Search 5

ranks, Survival 7 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Track.

Special: Darkvision as a racial trait or class feature.

Table 95: The Darkrunner

Hit Die: d6

Special: You must seek out a chapter house of the

Darkrunner Guild and successfully petition to join the

guild. Once you are a member, you gain your first level of

darkrunner. If at a later time you lose membership in the

guild, you become a darkrunner exile. You can still gain

levels in this prestige class, but you can no longer rely

upon the support of the guild.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  darkrunner

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  You  gain  pro ciency

with light armor and with martial weapons.

Direction Sense (Ex): You possess an incredible sense of

direction. If you study a single underground location for at

least 8 hours, that location becomes your directional focus until

you choose a new location and study it for 8 hours. You must

be within your directional focus to successfully study it. You

can use  nd the path (as the spell) to determine the shortest,

most direct physical route to your directional focus, as long as

you are within 5 miles of your focus. This ability works only

as long as you remain underground.

Spelunking (Ex): You are well trained in moving in and

through natural caverns. You gain a competence bonus equal

to your class level on Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Survival,

and Swim checks as long as you remain underground.

In  addition,  you  are  treated  as  one  size  category  smaller

than your actual size for the purpose of squeezing into narrow

tunnels or con ned areas.

Darkrunner Emblem: Upon becoming a darkrunner, you

are granted a darkrunner emblem by the Darkrunner Guild. This

minor magic item is detailed in the accompanying sidebar. If

your emblem is lost or destroyed, you can purchase a replace-

ment from any guild chapter house at a 50% discount.

Aberration  Lore  (Ex):  You  have  picked  up  a  trove  of

knowledge concerning aberrations. Beginning at 2nd level,

you gain a +2 competence bonus on any skill check, attack

roll, or saving throw made against an aberration.

Darkvision (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, the extent of your

darkvision increases by 10 feet. It increases by an additional

10 feet every other level.

Cave  ghting (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you are so familiar

with the terrain features of the subterranean world that you can

use them to enhance your combat ability. While underground,

you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your Intelligence

bonus, and you can move over dif cult terrain (see page 148 of

the Players Handbook) at normal speed. Additionally, as long as

you stand in a square of dif cult terrain, such as rubble or thick

undergrowth, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus

to your Armor Class.

Tunnelport  (Sp):  At  3rd  level

and higher, you can use an en-

larged dimension door effect as

a  spell-like  ability  once

per day. You cannot pass

through solid barriers

as you normally could

with  a  dimension

door  spell.  Addi-

tionally, the route

you take when us-

ing tunnelport must

follow an opening

no  more  than  10

feet  wide.  Your

caster  level  equals

twice your darkrun-

ner class level.

Tremorsense

(Ex):  Beginning  at

4th  level,  you  have

tremorsense  out  to  30

feet. You are sensitive to

vibrations in the ground

and  can  automatically

pinpoint  the  location  of

anything  that  is  in  contact

with the ground.

Lore of the Stones (Sp): At 5th level,

you gain an af nity with unworked stone. You

treat unworked stone as very soft ground when

making Survival checks to track quarry, and

can use stone tell as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to your

class level) once per day.

Aberration Specialist (Ex): At 6th level, your knowledge

about a particular kind of underground-dwelling aberration

increases. You must select a speci c kind of aberration that

has an environment entry of Underground, such as gibber-

ing mouther, mind  ayer, or umber hulk. Against this kind

of aberration, your bonuses from your aberration lore ability

increase to +4.

Deepsong (Su): All that occurs in the

depths  of  the  earth  is  witnessed

by  the  stone.  Over  the  ages,

an  in nite  legion  of  events

have occurred, and in their

passing  they  have  left

their  mark  upon  the

stone.  Beginning  at

7th  level,  you  can

attune  your  mind

to  experience  the

deepsong.  The

deepsong  can  be

seen,  felt,  heard,

and  tasted,  and

it  even  makes

itself  known

i n   m y s t i c a l

ways. While un-

derground,  the

deepsong  fills

you  with  a  sense

of  belonging  and

welcome.  This  ef-

fect  grants  you  a  +2

morale  bonus  on  all

In  addition,  your

stone  tell  spell-like  abil-

ity  becomes  much  more

powerful than the normal spell.

When you use this ability, the stones

relate complete descriptions of events

when asked. You can gain knowledge

of up to three facts from among the following topics with each

use: the layout of caverns and tunnels; the presence of plants

DARKRUNNER EMBLEM

This small brooch is worn by members of the Darkrunner Guild

and signifies the wearer as an ally or member of the organiza-

tion.

The emblem grants a +2 competence bonus on all Survival

checks made in underground locations, as long as it is worn

openly.  If  the  wearer  possesses  any  levels  in  the  darkrunner

prestige class, the emblem can be used to produce light (as the

spell) at will, and the emblem itself glows softly with pale blue

magical fire (as the continual flame spell). A character who has

been exiled from the guild but still has levels in the darkrunner

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

cannot  use  the  emblem  to  produce  light,  and  the  emblem

glows with pale red light instead of blue light. Most darkrun-

ners wear their emblems openly in the city but cover them with

a patch of cloth when in the wild. In this way, the light doesnt

draw unwanted attention but can be quickly exposed to aid in

smoothing  over  an  unexpected  encounter  with  an  intelligent

subterranean creature.

and fungi, minerals, bodies of water, or people; local animal

population; and the presence of elemental creatures, powerful

abominations, or undead.

Improved Cave  ghting (Ex): At 8th level, your cave ght-

ing techniques improve further. You can take 10 at any time

with any of the following skills while underground, even if

you are threatened or distracted: Balance, Climb, Escape Artist,

Jump, and Swim.

In  addition,  you  master  a  style  of  fighting  that  incor-

porates the terrain into your attacks. You might cause an

opponent to slip with a successful attack and twist an ankle

on loose rocks or to stagger into a sharp stalactite. You might

brace yourself against a cave wall to get a little bit of extra

pull on your bow. In any case, this fighting style works only

if you are standing in a square of difficult terrain. As long

as you do so, you add a circumstance bonus equal to your

Intelligence bonus (minimum +1) to damage rolls with all

melee weapons and any ranged weapon attacks at a range

of 30 feet or less.

Greater  Tunnelport  (Sp):  Beginning  at  9th  level,  your

tunnelport ability functions like greater teleport, although you

are still bound by the restrictions on the width of passages

you can teleport though. Your caster level equals twice your

darkrunner class level.

Stonewalking  (Su):  At  10th  level,  you  no  longer  need

con ne your underground exploration to caverns and pas-

sageways. For a limited number of rounds per day, you can

glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth

except metal as easily as a  sh swims through water. While

stonewalking, you have a burrow speed equal to your base

land speed; this burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole,

nor does it create any ripple or other signs of a presence. A

move earth spell cast on an area where you are stonewalking

 ings you back 30 feet and stuns you for 1 round if you fail a

DC 15 Fortitude save.

You can stonewalk for a number of rounds each day equal

to 10 + your Intelligence modi er. These rounds need not be

continuous; you can activate this ability for 4 rounds to pass

through a collapsed tunnel and still have the remainder of

your rounds available for use later in the same day. Activating

and deactivating stonewalking is a free action. If you are still

burrowing when you run out of time, you are immediately

ejected into the nearest open surface large enough to contain

you. Distance is not a factor, but the ejection is quite painful

and forces you to make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1 per 5 feet traveled to reach the open area) or be stunned for

1d4 rounds.

PLAYING A DARKRUNNER

You  are   rst  and  foremost  an  explorer.  You  express  a  near-

constant curiosity about what might lie beyond the next bend

in the tunnel. At the same time, you serve as a diplomat, since

your wanderings put you in contact with strange and secluded

societies. You should probably try to be friendly and easygoing,

someone who can be trusted as a guide and even a friend. Yet

beneath the surface, you are a resourceful, solid realist. The

deep earth is no place for the naive, and its travelers should

constantly suspect danger even when they feel safest.

Combat

You  should  focus  your  combat  skills  on  fast,  quick  strikes.

Your strength lies in your mobility in con ned spaces. Ranged

weapons arent as useful to you for two reasons: The lightless

environs  make  long-range   ghting  spotty  at  best,  and  the

winding tunnels and ample cover mean that you can never

count on being able to get a good shot at something more than

a few dozen feet away.

As you gain levels, you should focus on feats that allow you

increased mobility on the battle eld. Dodge, Mobility, and

Spring Attack are all excellent choices, since you can move

through dif cult terrain with ease to reach a creature, make

your attack, then skitter away before it can retaliate effectively.

Since other creatures cant move as quickly in such cramped

conditions, you can easily maintain the advantage in combat.

Feats  that  enhance  charges  can  also  be  useful,  since  the

cave ghting ability lets you charge over dif cult terrain with

ease.

Although you are most at home underground, many of your

abilities work just as well in dungeons closer to the surface or in

aboveground structures. Always be on the lookout for dif cult

terrain from which to establish your combat dominance.

Advancement

As you gain levels as a darkrunner, dont forget to keep up

your  ranks  in  various  Charisma-based  skills  such  as  Bluff,

Diplomacy, and Intimidate. Your wanderings underground

put you in contact with suspicious or outright hostile settle-

ments,  and  unless  you  intend  to   ght  everything  (a  poor

choice for anyone below the earth), you will be called upon

to present yourself and your companions as friendly visitors.

Any feats that aid these skills are likewise good choices as

you gain levels.

Remember  that  Speak  Language  is  a  class  skill  for  you.

Picking up one or two obscure languages per level is a good

idea, for the sake of being able to communicate with some of

the creatures you might encounter.

Since you will be wandering through unexplored areas, its

a good idea to be able to carry a lot with you, either supplies

from your last visit to town or magic items and other objects

you discover on your travels. Some sort of extradimensional

container, such as a bag of holding or a portable hole, is a wise

investment. You should also collect magic to augment your

various movement modes. A helm of underwater action, a ring

of swimming, slippers of spider climbing, and wings of  ying are all

quite useful when navigating unexplored tunnels.

DARKRUNNERS IN THE WORLD

Although darkrunners are content to simply explore under-

ground, those who belong to the guild (which accounts for

over  ninety  percent  of  darkrunners)  offer  their  services  as

guides  to  merchants,  pilgrims,  or  adventurers  who  need  to

traverse the gloomy underground regions of the world. They

are also called upon to serve as mercenaries in armies that move

through the deep earth. PCs might want to hire a darkrunner

for any of the above reasons, or they might encounter one alone

during an adventure.

Organization

See the presentation of the Darkrunner Guild, page 218.

NPC Reactions

The Darkrunner Guild has a powerful, well-known charter

to those who dwell below. A darkrunner is honor-bound to

serve and protect his charges from the dangers of the wild,

on threat of expulsion and exile from the guild. As a result,

most  nonaberration  underground  races  react  favorably  to

a darkrunner, and have an initial attitude of no worse than

indifferent despite any racial tensions that might exist between

the individuals.

Aberrations that recognize a character as a darkrunner have

an initial attitude of unfriendly at best, since the darkrunners

sometimes serve as spies against these races.

DARKRUNNER LORE

Characters  with  Knowledge  (local)  can  research  darkrun-

ners  to  learn  more  about  them.  When  a  character  makes  a

skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The darkrunner is an explorer, guide, and spy who

focuses his skills on the realm below.

DC 15: Most darkrunners belong to a powerful guild. This

guild  has  chapter  houses  underground,  including  many  in

otherwise hostile cities; these houses are excellent places to

rest and hide out if you happen to be allied with them.

DC 20: All darkrunners are expected to wear a magic badge

that proclaims their allegiance to the guild. Some darkrunners

have broken their ties with the guild. These darkrunners are

dangerous, but one can tell them apart from others by the red

glow their emblems emit. Someone who refuses to display his

emblem even though he claims to be a darkrunner is probably

lying about something.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success  can

learn important details about powerful darkrunners and their

guild in your campaign. They also know certain passwords

that can smooth over initial contacts with a darkrunner and

grant a +6 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks made to

adjust a darkrunners initial attitude.

DARKRUNNERS IN THE GAME

A darkrunner spends most of his time in the vast region of

caves and tunnels below the surface world. If the PCs wish to

explore underground, they might wish to secure the aid of a

darkrunner as a guide.

Darkrunners are naturally much sought after as guides to

various aberration outposts. A darkrunner NPC could easily

ally with adventurers or hire on with them to lead them to an

aboleth city or mind  ayer stronghold.

Adaptation

If your campaign world doesnt include a subterranean region,

you can still use the darkrunner after you make a few adjust-

ments. Simply pick an area of inhospitable terrain, such as a

swamp or a high mountain, and base the guild in this region.

You can even have the darkrunners serve as a highly special-

ized guild within the con nes of a particularly large city. In

this case, the guild would function more like a thieves guild,

although one more interested in helping visitors adapt to the

city than pro ting from them in an illegal manner. Several

of the darkrunners abilities can be adapted to work in alleys

or dense crowds, although the classs aberration lore feature

should  be  changed  to  something  more  appropriate  for  the

city in question.

A  sample  darkrunner  appears  in  the  description  of  the

Darkrunner Guild on page 218.

FLESHWARPER

The  esh is the key. It holds the secrets, the hidden words. It is the

constant between man and beast and monster. It is a simple matter,

once the way of the  esh is understood and embraced, to use it to your

will. It should not be abhorred simply for its differences, because the

eye can be retrained to  nd beauty in all things. For what is more

beautiful than the primal  esh? It is simply the purest form of expres-

sion one can hope to achieve.

Erkin Tiorki,  eshwarper

The   eshwarper  is  destined  to  walk  a  lonely  path,  for  few

have the stomach to accept what he considers enjoyable. To

a  eshwarper, there is no greater canvas than  esh itself. To

reshape,  reform,  and  rebuild  the   esh  into  a  new  form  is  a

closer step to divinity. To a  eshwarper, there are no taboos,

only possibilities.

BECOMING A FLESHWARPER

Most  eshwarpers are primarily wizards or sorcerers with a

level of cleric (or, more rarely, druid); this cleric or druid level

raises your maximum ranks in Heal to your character level + 3

even if you were forced to buy several of the required ranks as a

cross-class skill. The adept NPC class from the Dungeon Masters

Guide has access to both Heal and Knowledge (arcana), as well

as the summon familiar class feature, and thus can qualify for

this class by 6th level without multiclassing.

Such dedication pays in the long run. The  eshwarper learns

countless eldritch and disturbing secrets that most people can

never even guess at. Intelligence is perhaps the most important

of the classs abilities, since many of the  eshwarpers class

skills are keyed to it. The ability keyed to the  eshwarpers

spellcasting is also important, as is Constitution, since he has

fewer hit points than most other characters.

The  abilities  your  aberrant  familiar  can  have  are  as  fol-

lows:

Amorphous Form: A familiar with this ability is immune to

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Skills: Heal 4 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks.

Feat: Graft Flesh.

Special: Summon familiar class feature.

 New feat described on page 216.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the   eshwarper

prestige class.

Spellcasting: At each level above 1st, you gain new spells

per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class

to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

You do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that

class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a  eshwarper, you must decide to which

class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells

per day, caster level, and spells known.

Aberrant Familiar (Su): Your familiar (if you have one)

becomes tainted by your magic. The familiars type changes

to aberration, it gains darkvision out to 60 feet, and its form

becomes warped. Your aberrant familiar gains one of the abili-

ties described below, as chosen by you. At every third level you

gain  above 1st, your aberrant familiar gains another ability

from those described below. You cant choose the same ability

twice. If your familiar is killed and you obtain a new one, you

can choose new aberrant abilities for your new familiar based

on your current  eshwarper level.

Your aberrant familiar grants you a +2 bonus on all saving

throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities as long as

the familiar is within arms reach.

Your  eshwarper class levels stack with all other class levels

used to determine the familiars other attributes (see page 53

of the Players Handbook).

extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks.

Scales: The familiars natural armor bonus improves by 4.

The familiar gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves.

Size Increase: The familiars size becomes larger by one cat-

egory. Consult the Monster Manual for the effects of this size

increase on the familiars ability scores and other statistics.

Tentacle: The familiar gains a tentacle attack with a reach of

5 feet. The attack deals 1 point of damage (assuming Tiny size).

It cannot combine this attack with its other natural attacks.

Wings: The familiar can  y at a speed of 40 feet with good

maneuverability. (If the familiar already has a  y speed, use

whichever speed is higher and whichever maneuverability is

better.) The familiar gains a +2 bonus on Re ex saves.

Graft Reserve (Ex): You receive a pool of points you can

spend instead of experience points when creating a new graft

with your Graft Flesh feat. Each time you gain a class level, you

receive a new graft reserve; leftover points from the previous

level do not carry over. If the points are not spent, they are lost.

You can also use your graft reserve to supplement the XP cost

of a graft you are creating, taking a portion of the cost from

your graft reserve and a portion from your XP.

Elder Secret (Su): Your continuous self-experimentation in

grafting results in occasional improvements to your form. At

2nd level and every three levels thereafter, you make a powerful

discovery in your research and learn how to improve your body

in a subtle, minor way. Choose one elder secret from those

described below when you reach 2nd, 5th, and 8th level.

Secret of the Aboleth: You gain a swim speed equal to your base

land speed. You also gain a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks,

and can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check even when

rushed or threatened.

Secret of the Beholder: Your eyes protrude grotesquely from

your head and move independently of each other. You gain a

+4 racial bonus on Search and Spot checks, and you cant be

 anked.

on initiative checks and a +1

racial bonus on Re ex saving

throws.

Secret of the Destrachan: You

gain  immunity  to  damage

from sonic energy.

Secret  of  the  Ettercap:  You

gain  a  climb  speed  equal  to

your  base  land  speed  and  a

+8  racial  bonus  on  Climb  checks,  and

you  can  always  choose  to  take  10

on Climb checks even if rushed or

threatened.

Secret of the Gibbering Mouther:

Your  form  becomes  partially

amorphous.  You  have  a  25%

chance to ignore the extra

damage dealt by a critical

hit or a sneak attack.

Secret  of  the  Mind  Flayer:

You gain a +4 racial bonus on

saves  against  mind-affecting

spells and abilities.

Secret of the Otyugh: You gain immu-

nity to disease.

Secret of the Umber Hulk: You

gain  a  +2  racial  bonus  to

your natural armor.

Graft  Mastery  (Ex):  You  learn  how  to  create  and  apply

grafts normally not available to your race by studying forbid-

den tomes and consulting ancient nameless sources. When

you  rst gain the Graft Flesh feat, you choose a speci c type

of graft to associate with the feat (most likely silthilar grafts,

or  beholder  or  undead  grafts  from  the  Fiend  Folio  or  Libris

Mortis). At 3rd level, you can select a new type of graft to add

to the list. If you choose a graft type that normally requires the

creator to be a member of that race (such as aboleth and illithid

grafts, or  endish or yuan-ti grafts from the Fiend Folio), you

ignore that restriction completely. You can select a new graft

type every time you gain an odd-numbered  eshwarper level

higher than 3rd.

Rapid Grafting (Ex): Starting at 6th level, you can create

grafts with shocking speed. Creating a graft with Graft Flesh

now requires only 1 hour for each 1,000 gp.

Aberrant Apotheosis (Su): At 10th level, you undergo a

transformation into an aberration. Your type changes to aber-

ration, and you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You also gain a

+2 racial bonus to your Constitution score.

Erkin Tiorki, a  eshwarper

people are disgusted and afraid of what you

de ne as beauty. You take pride in your work, and you defend

your bodys improvements and those that you gift to others

until your dying breath. Yet you need not do so cruelly or with

violence; that is far from the best way to bring word of your

experiments to the world at large.

At best, others think of you as a mad scientist of sorts. You

are convinced that your experiments are performed for the bet-

terment of your kind, and that only by improving and re ning

what the deities have gifted to the world can humanoids hope

to survive. You tend not to be distracted by morality, ethics,

or compassion, yet need not be evil. You  nd delight in what

repulses  others,  and  in  so  doing  you   nd  ways  to  improve

yourself that others could never appreciate.

Combat

Although youre far from helpless in a  ght, the time you spend

ensconced in your laboratory and investigating new methods

to  improve  the   esh  does  not  improve  your  combat  skills.

Therefore, you should usually try to avoid direct combat.

Instead of just wading into melee, use your grafts and spells

to attack at range or to offset your inherent weaknesses before

entering combat. If you choose the latter route, you can become

quite a menace in combat if you protect yourself beforehand

with  spells  such  as  bears  endurance, bulls  strength, stoneskin,

mage  armor,  and  the  like.  Once  you  are  forced  into  melee,

any number of grafts can give you a signi cant advantage in

combat.

their leader. Aberrations are drawn to this prestige class as well;

a  eshwarper mind  ayer or grell would make a memorable

villain.

Advancement

As  you  gain  levels,  dont  be  afraid  to  create  new  grafts  for

yourself or your allies. The combination of grafting and the

various elder secrets you can learn make you more versatile

than your companions. Take care not to generalize too much;

you should decide early on what your goal should be with your

grafts. Do you want to be a better  ghter? A better scout? A

better spellcaster? Focus your elder secrets and grafts along

these lines, and youll  nd yourself in a much stronger position

than if your grafts and secrets arent complementary.

Regarding  interactions  with  others,  keep  in  mind  when

selecting new grafts for yourself how extreme they appear. If

you choose grafts that involve major changes to your appear-

ance, you might  nd yourself spending resources and time

just keeping others from attacking you on sight.

One way to combat this problem, of course, is to invest in

items such as a hat of disguise or a robe of blending that you can

use  to  disguise  your  grafts.  If  you  can  use  them,  a  wand  of

polymorph or alter self can be similarly helpful. If youre not

interested in how others react to your true appearance, though,

your best bet is to focus your purchases on items that augment

the particular type of grafts you select for yourself.

Resources

While most people are repelled by the  eshwarpers work, a

 eshwarper is usually an arcane spellcaster of no small skill.

Consequently,  a   eshwarper  is  often  tolerated  in  wizards

guilds  or  other  arcane  associations,  or  even  welcomed  in  a

guild of evil spellcasters who arent very squeamish about a

 eshwarpers  peculiar  interests.  As  a  member  of  a  guild  or

similar organization, a  eshwarper can often contribute to the

organization by teaching new spells, acquiring rare material

components, or capturing interesting creatures for study and

vivisection. The exact nature of the bene ts available in return

for those efforts depend on the guild in question.

FLESHWARPERS IN THE WORLD

Fleshwarpers  dont  make  new  friends  easily;  their  bizarre

obsession  with  alien  grafts  makes  them  dif cult  creatures

to approach. As a result,  eshwarpers live in out-of-the-way

places, deep in the wilderness or underground. The few who

live in large urban areas tend to be shut-ins and rely on allies

or  minions  to  run  errands  for  them.  Of  course,  exceptions

exist; rare  eshwarpers take glee in displaying their bodies

and discoveries to the world.

Too often, the lonely life of a  eshwarper leads to cruelty or

insanity. Evil  eshwarpers are sadists who enjoy the torments

they in ict on others as much as they enjoy the thrill of creat-

ing new grafts. The PCs might  nd themselves pitted against

a small army of graft-enhanced minions with a  eshwarper as

Organization

The  study  of  the   eshwarpers  art  is  a  solitary  pursuit.  No

organization  composed  exclusively  of   eshwarpers  exists.

However, evil  eshwarpers sometimes strike bargains with

powerful aberrations such as aboleths or mind  ayers, trading

their service and fealty for knowledge of new grafts.

NPC Reactions

Fleshwarpers have dif cultly interacting with others, espe-

cially with the keepers of the Cerulean Sign or the abolishers

of  the  Circle  of  the  True.  They  are  taken  to  be  aberrations

themselves, even well before they actually reach apotheosis.

Such individuals have initial reactions of hostile to a  esh-

warper; most others have initial reactions of unfriendly. This

extends even to other  eshwarpers; they guard their secrets

jealously and fear the interest of other  eshwarpers more than

anything else.

FLESHWARPER LORE

Characters with Knowledge (arcana) can research  eshwarp-

ers  to  learn  more  about  them.  When  a  character  makes  a

skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Fleshwarpers are spellcasters who specialize in the

construction of grafts.

DC 15: Fleshwarpers have several minions that they use as

guardians and experimental stock for their projects.

DC  20:  Not  all   eshwarpers  are  evil;  some  merely  seek

ways to enhance their bodies. The majority of them are cruel

and sadistic, though, and society as a whole should fear these

individuals.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success  can

learn important details about speci c  eshwarpers, including

the nature of their researches and possibly even what kind of

grafts they and their minions have.

FLESHWARPERS IN THE GAME

Fleshwarpers make excellent villainous masterminds. Their

minions  can  have  numerous  bizarre  and  deadly  grafts  to

make  them  more  dangerous,  and  the   eshwarper  himself

can  be  a  memorable  and  unique  villain.  Yet  they  can  also

make interesting allies; a friendly  eshwarper can give PCs

powerful grafts and assistance as rewards for accomplishing

tasks, or as payment.

Adaptation

Fleshwarpers are fairly insulated from the external factors of

a campaign world; as long as your world has grafts in it, the

 eshwarper can thrive more or less unadapted from the way

he is presented here.

If you are using the EBERRON Campaign Setting, you might

consider allowing the craft homunculus class feature of the

arti cer to be used in place of the summon familiar require-

ment, allowing arti cers with a more biological bent to pursue

this class.

Encounters

Evil  eshwarpers make excellent mad scientist villains. Their

lonely towers or buried dungeons are places of horror and mad-

ness, where twisted monstrosities gibber and shriek in endless

agony. Good and neutral  eshwarpers could serve as allies of

dubious virtue, sources of information that aberration hunters

consult only out of desperation. Some characters might even

seek out a  eshwarper, voluntarily subjecting themselves to

alteration and surgery in a search for strength and power.

EL 12: Erkin Tiorki is a gnome scholar who studies the

aberrant creatures of the Underdark. Long fascinated by the

tremendous strength and resilience demonstrated by such crea-

tures, he began to explore ways in which he could strengthen

his own small, frail form. He lives for the chance to pass on

the bene ts of his study to others, and thus often agrees to

perform grafts on willing characters. Unfortunately, not all

of his early work was as sound or stable as the work he is now

capable of, and a few former adventurers made into monsters

by  his  clumsier  efforts  hunger  for  revenge.  The  PCs  might

seek out Erkin to be modi ed with grafts in preparation for

a terrible challenge, or they might be paid to capture (or kill)

the  eshwarper by one of his former subjects.

KEEPER OF THE

CERULEAN SIGN

The enemy is ancient, eternal, and forever. Yet they are not without

weakness, for they have been put down before and shall be put down

again. The power of the Cerulean Sign has not faded over the eons;

it  has  grown.  With  its  power  within  my  soul,  I  cannot  help  but

prevail against the Elder Evils, and they cannot help but fall against

my might.

Selsharra Derissor, a keeper of the Cerulean Sign

The Cerulean Sign is an ancient rune of power, created untold

eons ago by a race or deity long since vanished. This ancient

race or deity clearly opposed the rise of the aberrant races,

yet its efforts were ultimately a failure. The aberration races

prosper, while their ancient adversary is forgotten. All that

remains is the Cerulean Sign and its still-potent power against

creatures from outside the realm of sanity.

The  power  of  the  Cerulean  Sign  draws  a  small  group  of

loyal keepers. These people work to keep the knowledge of

the Cerulean Sign alive, for without it, the ancient aberrations

cannot be opposed. But a keeper does far more than protect

the Cerulean Sign. She takes the  ght to the aberrations, and

speci cally to those they have seduced. She seeks out aberra-

tion cults and crushes them, ensuring that the foul taint from

beyond can never supplant what is pure in the world.

BECOMING A KEEPER

Since the keeper of the Cerulean Sign prestige class requires

both  spellcasting  and  a  large  number  of  skill  points,  the

Table 97: Keeper of the Cerulean Sign

Hit Die: d6

easiest  path  to  entering  this  prestige  class  is  through  the

bard  class.  Most  other  spellcasting  classes  either  need  to

wait  until  theyre  at  least  16th  level  so  they  can  acquire  8

ranks  in  a  cross-class  skill,  or  they  need  to  multiclass.  A

character of a class that cannot cast spells must multiclass

into a spellcasting class, but since all spellcasting classes can

cast the required spell to craft a cerulean sign, the choice of

spellcasting class is wide open.

Charisma is the most important ability for a keeper of the

Cerulean Sign, since it affects many of her skills and most of

her class features. Bard keepers also rely on Charisma for their

spellcasting and bardic music powers. After Charisma, Intel-

ligence and Wisdom are perhaps the most important ability

scores. Keepers of the Cerulean Sign rely on their magic and

skills  to  avoid  con ict,  and  thus  the  physical  ability  scores

arent as important to them.

Entry Requirements

Type: Cannot be an aberration.

Skills: Gather Information 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 8

ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 8 ranks, Sense Motive

5 ranks.

Feats: Aberration Banemagic, Craft Wondrous Item.

Special: Must create a cerulean sign without aid.

New feat described on page 178.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  keeper  of  the

Cerulean Sign prestige class.

Spellcasting: At each level, you gain new spells per day and

an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as

if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which

you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not,

however, gain any other bene t a character of that class would

have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before

becoming a keeper of the Cerulean Sign, you must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Cerulean Focus: Before becoming a keeper of the Cerulean

Sign, you must successfully craft your own personal version

of the sign. Once created, this item functions as a cerulean sign

ability functions as the spell detect aberration (see page 211),

except that it also allows you to detect the presence or absence

of any mind-affecting spells or supernatural abilities in effect

on any creature, as long as the effect in question was placed

there by an aberration. Additionally, it reveals any creature

that willingly belongs to a cult that knowingly worships aber-

rations. A cultist who believes he is worshiping Pelor when in

fact his devotions are led by a mind  ayer in disguise would not

register as tainted by the use of this ability, but a cultist who

worships knowingly under a mind  ayer would be revealed.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal

to your class level.

Greater Banemagic (Su): At 2nd level, you gain

the greater banemagic feature. This ability works

like the Aberration Banemagic feat (see page 178),

except that once per day you can triple the bene t

gained. The damage increases by 6d6 instead of

2d6 and the save DC increases by 6 instead of by

2. You gain an extra use of this ability at every

even-numbered class level (two times per day

at 4th level, three times per day at 6th level,

and so on).

Word of Revelation (Su): Start-

ing  at  3rd  level,  you  can  utter  a

word of revelation as a standard

action once per day. This super-

natural  ability  duplicates  the

effect  of  an  area  dispel  magic

that targets all spells or effects

from  the  school  of  illusion

that were originally cast by an

aberration or aberration cultist

within a 30-foot burst centered

on you. Additionally, any aber-

ration or aberration cultist in

the area must make a Fortitude

save  (DC  10  +  keeper  level

+  Cha  modi er)  or  take  1d4

points of Charisma damage.

Portal Warding (Su): Start-

ing at 5th level, you can place

a potent warding effect on any

doorway or magic portal once

per day. An aberration can pass

through a warded doorway or

magic  portal  only  if  it  makes

a successful Will saving throw (DC

10  +  keeper  level  +  Cha  modi er);

otherwise it cannot use the doorway or

portal and takes 3d6 points of damage.

An attempt to destroy the door or magic portal counts as an

attempt to pass through it. You know whenever an aberration

attempts to pass through the door or portal, and you also know

if the aberration is successful or not, provided you are on the

same plane as the warding.

You can maintain this effect inde nitely, but you can sustain

only one warded portal at any time.

Mental Backlash (Su): Beginning at 7th level, once per

day you can re exively lash out at any aberration or aberration

cultist that targets you but fails to affect you with a mind-

affecting spell or ability. You can do so only if you make a

saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or ability directed

at you by an aberration or aberration cultist. When this power

is activated, the aberration or cultist must make a Fortitude

saving throw (DC 10 + keeper level + Cha modi er) or take

1d6 points of damage per keeper level and become nauseated

for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage

and negates the nausea.

Cleanse  Aberration  (Sp):  At  10th  level,  as  a  standard

action  once  per  day  you  can  attempt  to  utterly  destroy  a

single aberration within 30 feet. The aberration must make

a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your Cha modi er) or be killed.

If the aberration is destroyed, you heal a number of hit

points equal to the number of hit points the aberration

had when it died.

Selsharra Derissor, a keeper of the Cerulean Sign

195

PLAYING A

KEEPER OF THE CERULEAN SIGN

You tend to be enigmatic, yet intrigue others with your words.

Your beliefs are based on ideals and concepts that predate the

worlds current governments, religions, and societies, yet those

ideas remain as compelling as anything those societies have

to offer. The Cerulean Sign has survived the eons not only

because of the power it carries but for the primal ideals and

needs it represents.

You can be rather mysterious regarding your motives and

needs. You know that the tendrils of aberrant taint can slip

unseen into the minds of the unsuspecting, so you keep what

you know to yourself for fear of exposing your plans and secrets

to the enemy. Your enemies include not only beholder cultists,

slavers who sell to the neogi, and thralls of the illithids, but

also the aberrations themselves, and their ageless, unknowable,

primal masters that lurk beyond the veil of reality.

Yet, unlike the abolishers of the Circle of the True, you and

your fellows are not pessimistic and dour people. On the con-

trary, you have a powerful personality and are quite passionate

about what you believe in. You must be, if you want  to combat

the  insidious  aberration  cults  that  fester  in  the  suggestible

corners of the world.

Combat

As a keeper of the Cerulean Sign, you are best at using your

magic and your skills to  ght enemies. In most combats you

fall back to a supporting role, using your spells to augment the

better  ghters in the group or to tend to the injured.

Against  aberrations  and  those  who  forsake  their  kin  to

throw in their lot with aberrations, you can be a terrible foe

indeed. Many keepers take one or two levels in a  ghting class

just to augment their combat skills for the inevitable con icts

with  aberrations  and  their  cultists,  but  even  without  such

measures, your ability to smite cultists can rapidly turn the

battle against these foes. If you have bard levels, the Music of

the Outer Spheres feat (see page 181) is an excellent choice to

aid in your struggles against aberrations.

Advancement

As you gain levels in this prestige class, you should maintain

maximum ranks in Bluff to trick cultists into thinking youre

one of them, in Decipher Script to make sense of weird tomes

and  messages  you  uncover  while  investigating  a  cult,  in

Knowledge (dungeoneering) to keep up on aberration lore,

and in Sense Motive to aid in detecting if people are being

magically manipulated. Spell Penetration and Greater Spell

Penetration are good choices for feats, since many aberrations

have spell resistance. Likewise, since many aberrations have

powerful mental attacks, Iron Will is always a good choice.

Since you will be  ghting cultists more often than not, its

probably a good idea to improve your combat skills by taking

feats such as Weapon Focus and Dodge.

Similarly, it cant hurt to invest in an aberration bane weapon.

Such a weapon can quickly take apart most of the creatures you

will end up  ghting. You might want to look into buying items

that enhance your skills, as well, such as a circlet of persuasion

or a rod of splendor. A rod of rulership can go a long way toward

wresting control of a large number of cultists away from their

unhuman  leaders.  You  should  also  not  hesitate  to  seek  out

magic items that speci cally defeat common aberration attacks.

A vest of escape can aid in getting out of grapple attacks, for

example, and a scarab of protection is invaluable when you face

an aberration with instant death attacks (such as a beholder).

Finally,  dont  forget  to  upgrade  your  cerulean  sign  as  you

gain levels. This magic item is quite helpful, and enhancing

its bonuses only makes it more so.

Resources

As a keeper of the Cerulean Sign, you do not have an organiza-

tion or guild to back you up. You are guided purely by your

own conscience and your need to oppose the aberration cults

that constantly threaten society. Yet you are not alone in the

world.

The Circle of the True supports the keepers as best they can,

providing a safe place for you to rest and recover, or sending

along  ghters or abolishers to help eradicate a cult when one

is discovered. See page 217 for more information on the Circle

of the True.

KEEPERS IN THE WORLD

The PCs normally wont attract the attentions of a keeper of the

Cerulean Signunless, of course, one of them is an aberration

cultist (or an aberration).

Its far more likely that the PCs  nd themselves working

with a keeper, even if they do not realize it at  rst. They might

grants the carrier a +1 resistance bonus on all Will saving throws

made against effects that originate from aberrations.

CERULEAN SIGN

The  ancient  cerulean  sign  is  a  potent  symbol  against  aberra-

tions and their ilk. Said to be an ancient glyph that captures and

focuses the power of the natural world, an item of jewelry that

bears a properly crafted cerulean sign becomes a potent ward

against creatures from outside the natural order.

A  cerulean  sign  is  usually  crafted  as  an  amulet,  but  it  can

sometimes be found in the form of a mantle, medallion, periapt,

or ring. As long as a cerulean sign is carried (either in the hand

or  in  a  pocket  or  container  you  are  wearing,  excluding  those

that create extradimensional spaces, such as bags of holding), it

If worn, a cerulean sign also grants a luck bonus to your Armor

Class and on all saving throws against attacks from aberrations,

as well as a luck bonus on level checks made to penetrate an

aberrations spell resistance. The magnitude of this luck bonus

ranges from +1 to +5.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, invoke the

cerulean sign; Price 4,000 gp (+1), 16,000 gp (+2), 36,000 gp

be working to in ltrate a cult base, encounter an undercover

keeper already established in the cult, and join forces with her

to achieve their common goal.

Organization

Although  the  keepers  of  the  Cerulean  Sign  operate  alone,

they  understand  the  value  of  having  friends  and  allies.  A

keeper often offers her services to an organization that has

goals similar to her own, such as the Circle of the True or a

good-aligned religion. In such cases, the keeper is afforded a

place on the periphery of the organization. Despite not being

a  true  member,  she  is  nonetheless  treated  as  an  equal.  Her

quarters on site are set off from the rest of the barracks, more

out of respect than for any other reason. Keepers tend not to

be interested in achieving or maintaining positions of power

among the leadership of an allied organization. Likewise, they

feel no urge to follow the orders of an allied organizations

commanders, but they usually do so nonetheless to maintain

goodwill.

NPC Reactions

A keeper of the Cerulean Sign who displays the sign, either by

wearing her personal cerulean sign openly or wearing clothing

or armor emblazoned with the rune, can expect others who

recognize  the  sign  to  react  appropriately.  Aberrations,  and

those allied with them, almost always have an initial attitude

of hostile toward a keeper. Druids, good clerics, members of

the Circle of the True, and similarly minded individuals have

an initial attitude of helpful.

Strangely, government leaders, paladins, and others with

investment in a lawful society distrust those who wear the sign,

most likely because their efforts to uproot and destroy aberra-

tion cults can completely disrupt the social order, especially

when  members  of  the  cult  also  happen  to  be  high-ranking

of cials. The keepers of the Cerulean Sign have a reputation for

not helping to sort out the mess this creates, since they would

rather turn their efforts toward tracking down the remnants of

the cult who might have escaped judgment. As a result, while

government of cials, paladins, and clerics of lawful deities can

have a wide range of initial attitudes toward a keeper (usually

indifferent), the keeper takes a 4 penalty on all skill checks

made to adjust such an individuals initial reaction.

KEEPER OF THE CERULEAN SIGN

LORE

Characters with Knowledge (history) can research the keep-

ers of the Cerulean Sign to learn more about them. When a

character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The keepers  ght against the formation of cults

founded by aberrations.

DC 15: The keepers arent an organized group; each of their

members operates alone. They do share a common devotion

to a strange rune.

DC 20: The Cerulean Sign that the keepers revere is an

ancient rune that is said to predate the gods themselves. This

result should also show the character what the Cerulean Sign

looks like.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success  can

learn  important  details  about  powerful  keepers,  including

their names, who they ally themselves with, and details of the

cults they have disrupted.

KEEPERS OF THE CERULEAN SIGN

IN THE GAME

A keeper of the Cerulean Sign might appear whenever a cult

of aberration worshipers  gures in the storyline. The keeper

might not be an obvious part of the story, but her presence

should nonetheless be felt at some point by the PCs. Perhaps

they need to convince the keeper of their honorable intentions

to progress in their quest. Likewise, a keeper might have run

into a dead end in her investigations and could make contact

with the PCs herself to recruit their aid.

Adaptation

If your campaign doesnt feature cultists who worship aber-

rations  or  are  easily  dominated  by  them,  you  can  still  use

this prestige class by adjusting its focus. Perhaps the keepers

oppose a speci c evil religion in your campaign world or a

corrupt government. One possible way to adapt this prestige

class is to reverse its role. Perhaps the keepers serve an ancient

philosophy  that  would  see  the  aberrations  rule  the  world.

They in ltrate churches and organizations and use their skills

to subtly twist and taint the members into worshiping and

supporting aberrations, effectively becoming that which the

keeper described here works so hard to oppose.

Encounters

A keeper of the Cerulean Sign is most likely to appear as a

much-needed  ally  for  a  company  of  adventurers  campaign-

ing against an aberration threat. The keeper might provide

spellcasting or information to the PCs, or even join the party

for a time to battle the aberrations. A keeper might appear as

an enemy if the party includes aberrant heroes such as  esh-

warpers or characters who have willingly allowed themselves

to be altered with grafts.

EL 13: Three years ago, Selsharra Derissor and her adventur-

ing company confronted a widespread and powerful beholder

cult  that  had  poisoned  a  lonely  barony  in  the  backlands  of

Furyondy.  She  and  her  friends  fought  bravely  against  their

abominable foes and discovered that they were not alone in

their  ght. A mysterious wizard named Ildrazar joined their

party and guided them in their battles against the beholder

overlords who ruled the cult. By wielding the power of a potent

mystic sign, Ildrazar provided assistance that proved decisive

in their crusade. Before he left, Ildrazar took Selsharra aside

and taught her the secrets of the Cerulean Sign, instructing

her in the lore of the keepers. She now continues his lonely

crusade, seeking resolute and skillful adventurers to whom

she might pass on the Sign.

Selsharra is a tall elf with a distant and thoughtful demeanor.

SANCTIFIED MIND

The foes of man are many and varied. Some seek simple conquest,

others  desire  the  fruits  of  our  civilization,  and  still  others  want

nothing more than to wipe us from the face of this world. Foes worse,

horri cally worse, than these exist. These foes seize the minds of the

innocent and bend them to their own wills, seeking to take our very

minds  from  us.  Some  of  these  evil  beings  raid  civilization  for  the

living, intelligent brains upon which they feed. Others seek power

by controlling our political and religious leaders. This is the horror

we stand against. We shall bear eternal vigilance to ward our home

from these abominations; such is our duty and our honor.

Sir Jeremy Costineux,

founder of the Society of the Sancti ed Mind

The  Society  of  the  Sancti ed  Mind  is  a  collection  of  elite

clerics,   ghters,  monks,  paladins,  psions,  psychic  warriors,

soulknives, and others who view the threat posed by the pres-

ence and goals of evil psionic-using creatures to be the most

dire menace facing civilized races today.

Members of this organization consider their cause to be a

crusade to rid the world of the awful and invisible in uence

of those who would seek to corrupt and pervert an individuals

right to think for herself. A sancti ed mind believes that all

evil-aligned psionics-using creatures (those that have psionic

abilities or that use psionic power points) must be crushed.

All members share this devotion, and the most fervent of the

orders  elite  warriors  take  the  name  of  the  society  itself  as

their name. This way, they say, they can never forget the vital

importance of their chosen mission.

The groups emblem is a silhouette of a human head (or a

humanoid one, depending on the race of the member bearing

the device) with a sword and a mace crossed above it. This

emblem signi es the societys pledge to  ght in protection of

BECOMING A SANCTIFIED MIND

While the order includes a wide variety of classes, the martial

tradition of the society makes entering the ranks of this pres-

tige class easier for similarly themed classes. Monks,  ghters,

paladins, clerics, psychic warriors, and psions make up the

bulk  of  the  orders  membership.  All

applicants must have some amount of

psionic capability, so even characters

who have focused exclusively on their

martial skills must take a level or two

in a psionic class, or the Wild Talent

feat, to enter.

An  applicant  need  not  pass  a

speci c  test  to  begin  training  as

a  sancti ed  mind,  but  a   erce

devotion  to  eliminating  evil

psionics-using  creatures

must  be  evident  in  the

potential recruits words and

deeds. Applicants undergo (with their

knowledge  and  approval)  rigorous

magical  and  psionic  examination  to

ensure that each is acting of his own

free  will  and  is  not  coerced  by  the

powers of evil psions or evil psionic

creatures, or those of such a creatures

minions.  Once  a  potential  recruit

passes these exams, he joins one

of the societys ward houses to

begin  training.

and spells known.

Alternatively,  at  each  level  above

 rst,  you  gain  new  powers  per  day,

an  increase  in  manifester  level,  and

powers  known  as  if  you  had  also

gained a level in a manifesting class to

which you belonged before adding the

prestige class level. You do not, how-

ever, gain any other bene t a character

of that class would have gained. If you

had more than one manifesting class

before becoming a sancti ed mind, you must decide to which

class to add each level for the purpose of determining powers

per day, manifester level, and powers known.

If you have both divine spellcaster levels and manifester

levels  upon  gaining  a  level  as  a  sancti ed  mind,  you  must

choose which class gains the bene t of this ability. You cannot

increase  both  your  spellcasting  and  manifesting  levels.  At

each level that grants this ability, however, you can choose to

improve either your divine spellcaster level or your manifester

level.  Choosing  one  way  does  not  restrict  you  to  the  same

choice when you gain your next level.

Partition Mind (Su): You can create a bastion of deter-

mination  and  resolve  that  helps  you  reduce  the  effects  of

mind-affecting spells and abilities. As an immediate action,

you  can  choose  to  partition  your  mind  even  if  dazed  or

stunned. While your mind is partitioned, you can choose

to  be  slowed  instead  of  suffering  the  normal  effect  of  the

mind-affecting spell or ability. Attacks with a durationfor

example, a hold person spell, a deep slumber spell, or the stun-

ning effect of a mind  ayers mind blastare only held in

abeyance. If the duration of your partitioned mind expires

while  the  effect  is  still  operative,  you  suffer  the  normal

consequences for the balance of the effects duration. You

can  keep  your  mind  partitioned  for  a  number  of  rounds

per day equal to your class level plus your Charisma bonus

(minimum 1 round per day).

For example, a 2nd-level sancti ed mind with a Charisma

score of 13 is subjected to a mind blast and is stunned for 6

rounds. If he uses his partition mind ability, he can spend 3

rounds slowed instead of stunned. His partition mind ability

then runs out, and he is stunned for the next 3 rounds.

Cleansing  Strike  (Su):  Beginning  at  2nd  level,  you  can

expend your psionic focus to smite a psionics-using creature

with one melee attack (including melee touch attacks). You

add your Wisdom bonus (if any) to your attack roll and deal

an extra 1d6 points of damage per sancti ed mind class level.

If you smite a creature that does not use psionics, the smite

has no effect but the ability is still used up for the day.

Disrupting Blow (Su): Starting at 3rd level, you can attempt

a disrupting blow against a psionics-using creature in melee

combat once per day. You have been taught the weak points

and  vulnerable  areas  of  a  psionic-using  creatures  source  of

mental power, and this ability allows you to take advantage of

that knowledge. The disrupting blow attempt must be declared

prior to the attack roll. On a successful hit, the target must

succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + sancti ed mind level +

Wis modi er) or lose access to all its psionic or psi-like abilities

for 1d4 rounds due to the psychic disruption dealt by the blow.

If the attack fails, the disrupting blow attempt is still used up

for the day.

At 5th level and higher, you can use this ability two times

per day.

Hard to Hold (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, you know how

to  wriggle  free  of  the  deadly  tentacles  that  are  so  common

among  aberrations  and  other  psionics-using  creatures.  You

gain a bonus equal to your class level on all grapple checks to

resist or escape from a grapple.

Power Resistance: At 6th level, you gain power resistance

equal to 5 + your character level.

PLAYING A SANCTIFIED MIND

You adhere to one of two schools of thought within the Society of

the Sancti ed Mind. The  rst is the traditional human member,

likely a cleric or paladin of St. Cuthbert. You believe that while

not all psionics-users are evil, the potential is always there, lurk-

ing in the background, and you likely distrust psionics-using

creatures in general (even those within your organization). You

probably quali ed for the prestige class by taking the Wild Talent

feat, and you probably advance your divine spellcasting class

rather than any manifesting class. Taking a level in a psionic

class would bring you away from your devotion to your deity,

and closer in some ways to the enemy you have vowed to  ght.

Your involvement in the church, the societys proselytizing about

the dire threat posed by evil psionics-using creatures, and the

orders urgent need for sturdy warriors drew you to join the ranks

of the society. Not all members of the churchs hierarchy share

the orders views, but the societys supporters are vocal even as

a minority. This faction suggests that joining the society is the

highest honor a worshiper of their deity could hope to achieve;

this fact alone reduces the amount of support the order garners

from the church at large.

The new commandant, a dwarf  ghter named Albaric, takes

a different tack. Neither human nor af liated in any formal

way with St. Cuthberts church, Albaric opened the ranks of

the society to all races and classes. Albaric has been especially

enthusiastic about recruiting members of psionic classes into

the order, believing that the best way to confront the mental

powers of evil psionics-using creatures is by using warriors

who possess similar abilities.

If you subscribe to this second school, you are less bound

to the old traditions of the order and its rigidly militaristic,

religious history. You are less likely to be lawful-aligned than

old-school members, but Albaric values your fresh perspective,

even if you receive the occasional cold stare or social slight from

a long-time member of the order. You likely quali ed for the

prestige class by taking a level (or more) in a psionic class. You

share Albarics belief that the best way to battle the threat of

evil psionics-using creatures is to use their most potent weapon

against them.

Combat

Regardless of the circumstances that brought you to the order,

you understand that the society considers itself at war with

all  creatures  that  would  use  psionics  to  enslave  or  control,

with their servant creatures, and with their mind-controlled

thralls everywhere. You know from your thorough studies or

from bitter experience just how horrible a foe an evil psion-

ics-using creature can be, and you seek to interpose yourself

and your special training between such vile entities and their

next intended victims. You do your utmost to destroy any such

creature you encounter.

You shouldnt mistake devotion to your cause for reckless

bravery.  The  society  is  not  a  large  organization,  and  the

number of sancti ed minds, while growing, is still small.

No one in the order receives kudos for needlessly risking his

own life or the lives of his comrades by seeking petty glory.

Only ultimate victory over the the use of psionics for evil

is an achievement worthy of the society and its sancti ed

members.

Many of the special abilities of this prestige class are usable

only in melee. Remaining alive and in ones own mind long

enough to confront your foes can be a dif cult task. Your own

psionic abilities and class features give you the ability to fend

off the attacks of evil psionics-using creatures until you are

close enough to bring your cleansing strike and disrupting

blow abilities into play.

Advancement

Depending  on  the  class  or  classes  you  had  levels  in  before

taking levels as a sancti ed mind, advancing in this prestige

class is not without cost. A  ghter or other martial character

loses the opportunity to pick up bonus feats and other combat-

related special abilities. While a sancti ed mind is a potent

melee  opponent  against  psionics-users,  your  repertoire  is

limited against most other creatures.

For those who are disinclined to strictly pursue levels in

the prestige class, multiclass options exist. If you want to gain

several feats quickly, a few levels of  ghter or psychic warrior

nicely round out the melee capabilities of a sancti ed mind.

For those willing to abide with little or no mundane armor,

levels of sorcerer or even monk complement your sancti ed

mind levels well. If you would prefer to keep wearing armor,

cleric levels improve your Will save and impart spellcasting

ability.  Levels  of  psion  likewise  enable  you  to  wear  armor,

provided you have pro ciency with it, while also enabling you

to advance your manifesting ability.

Resources

While the sancti ed minds are still of cially sanctioned by the

church of St. Cuthbert, the churchs hierarchy has withdrawn

much  of  its  support  since  Albaric  became  commandant.

Fortunately for the order, government bodies recognize the

value of having a society ward house nearby. Many cities and

nations waive taxes on the order and even help it pay some of

its maintenance costs (property rental or taxation, foodstuff,

gear, weapons, minor magic items, and so on).

The society asks that members tithe some of the earnings

from their adventures back to the society, but under Albaric,

such tithing is strictly voluntary. Most members contribute

ten percent to twenty percent of their income anyway, either

from habit, in gratitude and recognition for the training they

receive, or for both reasons.

SANCTIFIED MINDS IN THE WORLD

The society does its best to maintain open channels of com-

munication  to  local  and  regional  governments,  and  has  its

own  network  of  scouts  and  spies.  Of  particular  concern  to

the group is news of any incursions from underground. Evil

psionics-using creatures seem to favor the dark places beneath

the earth, and any hint of illithid or aboleth activity brings a

society member or ally to investigate further. If circumstances

warrant and a ward house is nearby, the order dispatches a

group containing at least one sancti ed mind to determine the

extent of the incursion and eliminate the threat themselves if

possible. In cases where the full resources of the society cannot

be  brought  to  bear,  agents  invite  or  even  hire  independent

adventuring groups to take up the matter.

Organization

The societys activities revolve around its ward houses. These

places  contain  sanctuaries,  barracks,  training  grounds,  and

recruitment of ces for the order. While most ward houses are

found in heavily populated areas, some exist on the frontiers

or in the wildlands, near underground entrances or mountain

cave systems where psionic creatures are likely to lair.

All members of the Society of the Sancti ed Mind are wel-

come to live within the ward house, which is often a converted

military barracks, forti ed temple, or other defensible site.

Some ward houses lie within religious complexes dedicated

to St. Cuthbert, although both Albaric and some among the

churchs hierarchy would like to see that situation change. All

society members share equally in the tasks of maintaining the

ward house, such as kitchen duty, garrison and patrol, or facil-

ity maintenance and repair, based on individual background

and skill.

As the order itself is led by a commandant, so is each ward

house.  A  small  number  of  adjutants  aids  the  commandant.

Below them come the sancti ed minds; all members of this class

technically outrank all nonmembers of the class, but Albaric

considers this arrangement unfair and has begun striving to

phase  out  that  rule.  The  ward  house  commandant  is  often,

although not always, the highest-level sancti ed mind (espe-

cially since Albaric became the orders overall commandant)

or occasionally the highest-level cleric of St. Cuthbert attached

to that ward house. Other members of the society are given

respect and rank based on their experience level.

NPC Reactions

In the past, the society was viewed in much the same light as

the church that supported it. If you admired or respected St.

Cuthbert and his teachings, you got along well with the society.

This, too, has changed recently.

Albarics  distancing  of  the  order  from  the  church  has

helped to broaden its support. Viewed as less rigidly con ned

to military tradition and a strict code of law, the society now

enjoys backing from neutral good and chaotic good races and

governments. More groups have begun to view the order in a

positive light since members of more races and classes were

permitted to join the Society of the Sancti ed Mind. Some

still feel the society is too narrowly focused; its operations and

personnel would better serve civilization if its members werent

so obsessed with such a rare, though admittedly despicable,

group of creatures as evil psionics-users.

Given this devotion, the group has occasionally, and with

hesitation,  worked  with  other  foes  of  the  mind   ayers:  the

githzerai. The society admires the zeal with which the githzerai

seek out and destroy the illithids. However, the evil nature of

the githyanki prevents the order from making the same sorts of

alliances with that race, which sancti ed minds seek to destroy

as  much  as  any  other  evil  psionics-using  race.  Information

about the Society of the Sancti ed Mind has even made its

way to Limbo, and some nonevil githzerai have become very

interested in a group that loathes their two most hated enemies

as much as they do. Word has recently reached Albarics ears

that a handful of githzerai have applied for membership in the

society, and that at least one hopes to begin sancti ed mind

training soon.

The Society of the Sancti ed Mind is not large, but it is not a

secret society. As noted above, Albarics changes have increased

the orders public pro le. The commandant hopes that this

results in broader backing, more members, and a higher level

of consciousness among the public regarding the threat posed

by evil psionics-using creatures.

There are no known instances of evil psionics-users directly

attacking order members to assassinate them, nor of outright

assaults on society ward houses. Members of the society remain

aware of the possibility of such actions. They remain vigilant

to any attempts evil psionics-using creatures might make to

insinuate a spy or other informant into a ward house.

SANCTIFIED MIND LORE

Characters  who  succeed  on  a  Knowledge  (dungeoneering)

check  can  learn  the  following  information,  including  the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The church of St. Cuthbert sponsors an order known

as the Society of the Sancti ed Mind that  ghts evil psions

and psionics-using creatures.

DC  15:  The  societys  leadership  has  recently  changed,

and the new commandant welcomes all heroes of brave heart

and strong mind to join the battle against evil psionics-using

creatures.

DC 20: The society gives special training to its elite mem-

bers. These members take the name of the group when their

training begins.

DC 25: Sancti ed minds specialize in melee combat with

psionics-using creatures, using unique and powerful abilities

to protect themselves and kill the creatures up close.

DC  30:  This  level  of  success  rewards  the  character  with

campaign-speci c details and information, to be determined

by the DM.

SANCTIFIED MINDS IN THE GAME

In campaigns in which psionics or psionics-using creatures

play a signi cant or even a major role, incorporating the Society

of the Sancti ed Mind into your game makes sense. Even if

the PCs do not become sancti ed minds or join the society

itself, the order always welcomes stalwart, reliable heroes as

allies. The society is small and has limited resources; hiring

a worthy band of adventurers to explore a set of caverns or

investigate  rumors  of  mass  abductions  allows  the  groups

members to remain focused on their crusade. The society can

also provide gear, minor magic items, and healing and other

restorative magic to parties in need.

Adaptation

In your campaign, the societys present level of af liation with

the church of St. Cuthbert remains open. Your games Albaric

might sever all ties completely (alienating society members in

doing so), or he might have become a convert during his years

with Sir Jeremy. Its recommended, in any case, that Albarics

reforms allowing more diverse membership in the order and

among the ranks of the sancti ed mind class should stand.

In  this  way,  the  group  and  the  class  are  more  appealing  to

players and their PCs.

If  you  do  not  use  the  core  games  pantheon,  replace  St.

Cuthbert with any lawful good or good-inclined neutral deity

that isnt afraid to bash a few heads. If you use the FORGOTTEN

REALMS setting, deities as such Helm, Ilmater, the Red Knight,

Torm,  or  Tyr  are  suitable  replacements,  depending  on  your

tastes and those of your players. In the EBERRON setting, the

Church of the Silver Flame, the deities of the Sovereign Host,

and  even  the  Undying  Court  are  suitable  sponsors  for  the

society.  Good-aligned  psion  adherents  of  the  Path  of  Light

make particularly apt sancti ed minds.

Encounters

Most encounters with society members occur under one of

two sets of circumstances. In the  rst, the PC heroes enter

a town or city that contains a society ward house, and they

hear of it or meet a few of its members. The meeting might be

coincidental, or one party might seek out the other for some

reason. The characters might be after illithid- or aboleth-related

information, or the society might wish to hire the party for a

mission to seek out an evil psion or soulknife assassin.

The second set of circumstances involves the PCs meeting

society members in the course of an adventure. Perhaps the

society  is  investigating  the  same  rumors  or  activities  that

brought the PCs to the area. Evil psionics-using creatures do

not have to be involved; this lead could turn out to be false

from the societys perspective. Will the society member help

the PCs even if such creatures arent involved? What if they

are behind whats going on? Will the society member offer

to commission the party to act in the societys name? Perhaps

the PCs are  ghting a psionics-using creature on their own

and  come  across  society  members  their  foe  has  captured

(not knowing them to be any different from other captives,

at least at  rst). If they are rescued by the PCs, how much

do the society members tell them, and do the adventurers

believe them?

A sample sancti ed mind appears in the description of the

Society of the Sancti ed Mind on page 219.

TOPAZ GUARDIAN

No evil that crawls on or below the face of the earth is the equal of our

true and righteous wrath. Be resolute, be determined, be relentless in

your pursuit of creatures that enslave or devour human beings. This

is a war of extermination, and failure is unthinkable.

Jasminder Aree, Grand Sunwarden

The Holy Order of the Supernal Topaz Defenders (or the Topaz

Order, for short) is an organization of righteous knights, clerics,

and champions united in the defense of humankind and its

allies  from  the  threat  of  unhuman  monstrosities.  While  it

opposes all intelligent races that prey on humanity, the order

reserves its special hatred for creatures that use mind-affecting

magic to dominate and enslave humans and other good-aligned

humanoids.

Followers of Heironeous, members of the order comprise

an elite band of warriors. Resolute crusaders, the topaz guard-

ians are the elite initiates of the order. They boldly confront

unhuman predators such as mind  ayers, beholders, aboleths,

and neogi, their spies and agents, and any beings allied with

the monsters, seeking to exterminate the creatures at every

opportunity.  Other  aberrations  with  similarly  monstrous

and evil schemes also have the enmity of the Topaz Order. If

mind  ayers or aboleths arent close at hand, topaz guardians

are more than willing to seek out and destroy the outposts of

aboleths, beholders, tsochari, and like creatures.

The Topaz Order is so named because its emblem is a bril-

liant  oval  yellow  topaz  on  a   eld  of  cobalt  blue.  The  topaz

symbolizes  protection,  resolve,  and  the  sun,  and  is  always

used in the creation of the topaz diadems for which the order

is renowned.

BECOMING A TOPAZ GUARDIAN

While the Topaz Order includes a number of good-aligned

 ghters,  clerics,  monks,  and  paladins,  only  a  few  of  these

stalwarts pursue the path of the topaz guardian. Most topaz

guardians are paladins, monks, or  ghter/clerics. A human

paladin with a decent Intelligence score has the easiest time

qualifying for the class.

An  applicant  must  be  a  skillful  warrior,  strong  of  will,

with keen perception, experience in underground explora-

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the topaz guardian

prestige class.

Spellcasting: At 2nd, 4th, and 5th levels, you gain new spells

per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class

to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

You do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that

class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a topaz guardian, you must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Topaz Diadem: All topaz guardians are given a topaz diadem

as a symbol of their devotion and a shield against their foes.

The diadem is a sturdy headband of  nely tooled leather, with

a large yellow topaz set in its center. See the sidebar on this

page for a description of the topaz diadems effects.

At  3rd  level,  the  sacred  bonuses  offered  by  the  diadem

increase to +2. At 5th level, the bonuses increase to +3.

Topaz  diadems  function  only  for  members  of  the  topaz

guardian prestige class. If your diadem is lost or destroyed,

you can obtain another one from the order at a cost of 6,000

gp and after a wait of twelve days.

Smite Aberration (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, you can

attempt to smite an aberration once per day with one normal

melee attack. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your

attack  roll  and  deal  an  extra  2  points  of  damage  per  topaz

guardian  class  level.  If  you  smite  a  creature  that  is  not  an

up for the day.

At 4th level, you can attempt to smite aberrations twice per

day.

Hard to Hold (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you learn how

to  wriggle  free  of  the  deadly  tentacles  that  are  so  common

among  aberrations  and  other  psionics-using  creatures.  You

gain a bonus equal to your class level on all grapple checks to

resist or escape from a grapple.

PLAYING A TOPAZ GUARDIAN

You are a courageous and honorable defender of your people.

Compassion, piety, and love for your people have inspired you

to dedicate yourself to the unending battle against the darkest

and most terrible of foes. While other warriors facing such

enemies become grim and cynical, your faith in the righteous-

ness of your cause shields you from such disillusionment. You

are  ghting the good  ght, and your certainty helps to anchor

you against the foul darkness and mind-numbing horrors you

must face.

While you embody the virtues of compassion and love for

your fellows, you understand that your enemiesaboleths,

mind  ayers, and other unhuman monstrositiesare creatures

of irredeemable evil, deserving of nothing but the  swiftest

and most thorough destruction you can deliver. You are an

implacable foe, and when you confront your sworn enemies,

you burn with a brilliant and righteous wrath that few can

withstand. By your courage and dedication you hope to set an

unforgettable example, so that your zeal might serve to ignite

in others the will to combat evil.

Combat

You live for the opportunity to bring aberrations and other

such abominations within reach of your sword or  sts. Thanks

to your training and your diadem, you can resist the insidious

mental attacks of such monsters. Your superior combat skills

provide you with an uncanny ability to oppose the hordes of

minions employed by master aberrations.

While you possess no shortage of physical courage and zeal

for your cause, you are not a witless thug. Its true that you are

inclined to surprise your aberration foes by battering through

their defenses with speed and determination, but you will not

recklessly  throw  away  your  life  if  you  can  help  it.  The  best

weapon against an aberration outpost is a well-coordinated team

of heroes with a variety of skills and strengths, not a solitary

avenger whose only alternatives are to conquer or die. Therefore,

you look for opportunities to strip away the advantages of your

enemies by the clever use of your companions magic and skills

so you can face them as you were meant to: holy steel against

writhing tentacles, righteous zeal versus unhuman evil.

Advancement

Qualifying  for  the  topaz  guardian  prestige  class  requires

forfeiting at least one feat that you are likely to miss. As you

gain levels, you will probably want to catch up on the good

combat feats you missed earlier. Weapon Focus and Improved

Critical are quick ways to improve your combat ability. Power

Attack  and  Cleave  are  also  good  choices.  Dont  overlook

Improved Sunder; some creatures that attack with tentacles

can be literally disarmed by a determined attack against their

natural weapons.

If you want to multiclass while advancing as a topaz guard-

ian, consider taking  ghter levels. You want to gain a lot of

feats quickly, and the  ghter class is simply the best for that.

A level or two of cleric is not bad, either, since it helps your

Will save even more and gives you some spellcasting ability.

Resources

The Topaz Order is naturally strongest and most well estab-

lished in lands that face serious aberration threats. The church

of  Heironeous  does  all  it  can  to  support  the  order  in  such

places.  In  general,  a  topaz  guardian  can  obtain  healing  (or

other spellcasting services) from a cleric of Heironeous at 25%

of the normal cost, and his companions can obtain healing at

75% the normal cost.

The  church  also  goes  to  some  trouble  to  provide  topaz

guardians with the magical  repower they need to  ght their

sworn enemies. A topaz guardian with a reputation for success

can borrow speci c items necessary for his expeditions. If the

item is expended, the guardian is expected to compensate the

church accordingly. The speci c items available are left to the

DMs discretion, but in general, an item or items totaling no

more than 10% of the wealth guidelines given on Table 51 in

the Dungeon Masters Guide is not unreasonable. For example,

a  6th-level  paladin/4th-level  topaz  guardian  is  a  10th-level

character, so items up to 4,900 gp in value (10% of 49,000) could

be borrowed. To borrow items, a topaz guardian must establish

a good personal relationship with the locally presiding cleric

of Heironeous, and he must possess a reputation for successful

adventuring and personal integrity. Of course, it might take

time to obtain unusual or speci c items.

TOPAZ GUARDIANS IN THE WORLD

The  Topaz  Order  remains  constantly  vigilant  for  signs  of

aberration  incursionsspeci cally,  aboleth  raids,  grell

hunts, neogi slaving raids, and mind  ayer attacks. Individual

members of the order seek out adventuring companies going

into aberration-held areas and ask them to bring back news

of mind  ayer sightings or similar threats. Order members

also organize elite bands or companies (including adventur-

ers) to raze aberration outposts and drive them back into the

underground depths.

Organization

The Holy Order of the Supernal Topaz Defenders is divided

into  a  number  of  relatively  small  chapters.  Each  chapter

includes  anywhere  from   ve  to  twenty  clerics,  paladins,

 ghters,  monks,  and  topaz  guardians,  all  of  whom  share  a

chapter  house  or  base  of  operations  in  a  good-sized  temple

to Heironeous. The members of a chapter make an effort to

assemble once a month to share news, install new members,

and recognize notable achievements. Its not at all uncommon

for the chapter house to be virtually deserted at most other

times. The order members have other duties and responsibili-

ties scattered all over the region, and even those who dont have

other duties are frequently engaged in efforts to ferret out the

secret strongholds of their sworn enemies.

The order recognizes four ranks: Brother (or Sister), Guard-

ian, Sunwarden, and High Sunwarden. Brothers and Sisters

make up about two-thirds of the membership; these are the

 ghters,  clerics,  paladins,  and  others  who  have  sworn  alle-

giance to the Topaz Order, but who have not actually taken

levels in the topaz guardian prestige class. Brothers and Sisters

are the foot soldiers of the society, called upon to

join companies attacking aberration strongholds,

but otherwise left to their own devices.

Guardians  have  taken  levels  in  the

prestige class. They are champions, com-

manders, and agents who have no other

duties  in  the  church  of  Hei-

roneous.  The  most

experienced  guard-

ian  in  a  chapter  is

appointed the chap-

ters Sunwarden, or

leader. A Sunwarden

is considered equal in rank to

the high priest of a temple of

Heironeous, but defers to the

ranking  cleric  of  the  temple

that hosts his chapter house.

Sunwardens who lead chap-

ters  of  more  than  twelve

members, or who have been

especially recognized by the

head of the order, are referred

to  as  High  Sunwardens.  The

leader  of  the  Topaz  Order  is

Grand Sunwarden Jasminder

Aree (LG female human

paladin  7/topaz  guard-

ian 10), who governs the

Hall  of  the  Supernal  To-

paz, a forti ed abbey located

near Verbobonc.

NPC Reactions

The knights who serve in the Topaz Order form only one of the

knightly orders, martial societies, and dedicated fellowships

to be found in a typical human kingdom. Not many common

folk know the speci c cause or composition of the Topaz Order,

and so commoners view topaz guardians in much the same

way that they would view any temple-sworn knight or paladin

in the service of Heironeous. Good-aligned people look upon

topaz guardians as valorous defenders of the common gooda

little overzealous or aristocratic to be really likable, perhaps,

but admirable nonetheless. Evil-aligned creatures detest the

crusading zeal of the order, and regard topaz guardians as self-

righteous inquisitors who insist on making others adhere to

their ridiculous standards of conduct and morality.

The  topaz  guardians  get  on  well  with

the abolishers of the Circle of the True;

members  of  the  Circle  hold  a  help-

ful attitude toward topaz guardians,

even  if  they  sometimes  think  that

the  guardians  are  a  little  too  fo-

cused  on  master  aberrations  as

opposed to the entire abomina-

ble class of monsters. Keepers

of the Cerulean Sign are also

friendly  toward  members  of

the  Topaz  Order.  While  they

believe that the guardians have

an overly simple notion about

how to go about opposing the

machinations of aberrations,

the keepers certainly respect

the topaz guardians determi-

nation and zeal.

Naturally,  any  master  ab-

erration aware of the orders

existence  views  its  adher-

ents in the worst possible

light.  Aboleths,  mind

 ayers,  and  other  such

aberrations  are  without  fail

hostile  to  the  topaz  guard-

ians  and  all  who  travel  with

them.

THE TOPAZ DIADEM

All topaz guardians wear a magic headband known as a topaz

diadem. A diadem confers a +1 sacred bonus to AC and a +1

sacred  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  attacks  made  by  or

effects created by evil creatures. It also blocks any attempt to

possess the wearer or to exercise mental control over the wearer

by means of enchantment (charm) or enchantment (compul-

sion)  effects,  as  described  in  the  spell  protection  from  evil.

(Some enchantment spells, such as hold person, do not require

the caster to actively exercise mental control, and therefore still

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

work against the wearer of a diadem.) Unlike the spell, a diadem

offers no protection against summoned creatures.

Diadems are created for members of the Topaz Order, and

function only for characters of the topaz guardian prestige class.

As a wearer gains levels in the topaz guardian prestige class,

his topaz diadem likewise grows more powerful; see the topaz

guardian prestige class description.

Moderate  abjuration;  CL  9th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  bless,

magic circle against evil, creator must be a member of the Topaz

Order; Price 12,000 gp.

205

The Topaz Order is not particularly secretive, but it is not

large either. All but the most isolated clerics of Heironeous

know of the order, but only those clerics who happen to serve in

towns near chapter houses of the order know where members

can be found. Clerics of temples of Heironeous located in large

cities (or large towns, if the region is subject to aberration activ-

ity) host chapters. Clerics of temples in large towns (or larger

communities) can point inquirers toward likely locations for

Topaz Order chapter houses, while clerics of temples in smaller

towns must ask their fellows in larger or more centrally located

shrines to  nd out where inquiries should be directed.

TOPAZ GUARDIAN LORE

The Topaz Order is closely af liated with the church of Hei-

roneous. Characters who succeed on a Knowledge (religion)

check  can  learn  the  following  information,  including  the

information from lower DCs.

DC  10:  The  church  of  Heironeous  sponsors  a  knightly

order known as the Topaz Order.

DC 15: Knights of the Topaz Order are dedicated to  ghting

evil monsters such as mind  ayers or aboleths. Members of

the Topaz Order work to organize the defenses of humankind

against  these  monsters,  and  they  mount  expeditions  to  go

underground and burn out any outposts they  nd.

DC 20: The elite champions of the Topaz Order are known

as topaz guardians. Each one carries a special topaz diadem, a

magic gem that protects him against evil magic. Theyre experts

in  ghting mind  ayers and other aberrations.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success learn

important details about speci c guardians, their exploits, and

their enemies.

TOPAZ GUARDIANS IN THE GAME

The Topaz Order serves as an excellent patron or sponsor for

adventuring parties  ghting aberration threats. Even if none

of the PCs belong to the order, farsighted members always look

out for good-hearted and capable heroes who can be rallied

against aberration incursions.

The topaz guardian prestige class appeals to players who like

to roleplay virtuous and determined heroes, such as paladins or

lawful good clerics or monks. Make sure you give the player the

opportunity to be pious, dedicated, and courageous in the face

of the foulest horror. The player of a topaz guardian doesnt want

to deal with a quagmire of moral ambiguities and hard choices;

he wants the opportunity for his character to confront evil and

pound it into jelly with his bastard sword. Your adventures dont

have to be simple-minded or absolutely lacking in shades of

meaningmake sure you dont run too many adventures that

force the PC to choose between evils or make it impossible for

him to act courageously and con dently.

Adaptation

setting, the deities Tyr, Helm, or Torm serve as good patrons for

the Holy Order of the Supernal Topaz Defenders. In the EBER-

RON setting, the Church of the Silver Flame boasts the greatest

number of topaz defenders, who are joined in their battles by

adherents of Boldrei and Dol Arrah of the Sovereign Host.

Encounters

Topaz guardians are most commonly encountered as potential

allies for the heroes, especially when the heroes are taking on

mind  ayers or other master aberrations. On occasion, topaz

guardians  might  attempt  to  discourage  adventurers  from

provoking  aberrations  that  are  too  strong  to  be  dealt  with.

For example, a topaz guardian might try to stop a party from

unsealing a portal leading to a powerful mind  ayer stronghold

if he doesnt think he can defeat the mind  ayer response.

A sample topaz guardian appears in the description of the

Topaz Order on page 221.

MAGIC

While  master  aberrations  have  unique  and  deadly  spells

and  magic  items  all  their  own,  humanoids  associated  with

aberrationsalienists, cultists, minions, spies, or dedicated

huntersalso wield specialized magic in the service of or in

opposition to the master aberrations. Aberration deities spawn

horrible new cleric domains that some cultists make use of;

both aberration spellcasters and aberration hunters create new

spells of all sorts; and  nally, aberrations know the secrets of

many  magic  items,  including  various  grafts  and  improve-

ments that are sometimes in icted on humanoids.

SPELLS

While  several  of  the  master  aberrations  develop  their  own

arcane spells, many of these are divine spells associated with

the  various  domains  of  aberration  deities.  Some  are  found

only in the hands of hateful humanoid cultists, while others

are potent weapons against aberrations.

ARMS OF PLENTY

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Two  clawed  arms  grow  out  of  the  subjects  body.  The  arms

are roughly humanoid, but are either scaly or furred and end

in sharp talons. The spell transforms any clothing or armor

worn by the creature to accommodate these additional arms;

when  the  duration  ends  the  creatures  clothing  and  armor

return to normal.

The arms grant the subject two primary claw attacks. A hit

from one of the claws deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 points

(1d4 if Small) plus the creatures Strength modi er. The claws

cannot be used to wield weapons or manipulate objects. Since

the claws are primary attacks, you can attack with them in

addition to making your weapon attacks without penalty. The

claws count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the

arms can rend the target for extra damage equal to 2d6 points

plus 1-1/2 times the subjects Strength modi er.

Multiple castings of arms of plenty on a creature do not stack;

the duration simply resets.

Material Component: A xills claw.

BEFOUL

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Cleric 8, Corruption 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Area: Water in a volume of 100 ft./level by 100 ft./level by

10 ft./level (S)

Duration: Permanent; see text

Saving Throw: None; see text

Spell Resistance: No

more Hit Dice immersed in this water must make a saving

throw as if drinking it.

If the caster affects only part of a larger body of water, the

befouled water mixes with the pure water. If the entire body of

water is no more than four times the size of the affected area,

all the water in the body of water is befouled 24 hours later,

but the damage from drinking or swimming in the water is

only 1d2 points of Constitution damage. If the body of water

is more than four times the affected area but less than twenty

times the affected area, after 24 hours all of the water tastes

foul but has no damaging effect. If the entire body is larger

than twenty times the affected area, fouled water mixes with

the clean water and loses all effect after 24 hours.

Material Components: A dead  sh and a drop of poison.

BLAST OF FORCE

Evocation [Force]

Level: Force 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Ray

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You direct an invisible blast of force at a chosen target. The

blast is a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage

per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). In addition, a successful

hit forces the target to make a Fortitude save or be knocked

down (size and stability modi ers apply to the saving throw

as if the spell were a bull rush).

BOLTS OF BEDEVILMENT

Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Madness 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Ray

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell grants you the ability to make one ray attack per

round. The ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind

so that it takes no action for 1d3 rounds. The creature is not

stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it), but

it cant move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

BRAIN SPIDER

The caster makes water (or other liquid) foul and mildly poison-

ous. All creatures with 1 Hit Die or less that are in the water

at the time of the casting die immediately. Anyone drinking

this water must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or take

1d4 points of Constitution damage. Any creature with 2 or

Divination [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Cleric 8, Mind 7

Components: V, S, M, DF

Targets: Up to eight living creatures within range

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  allows  you  to  eavesdrop  as  a  standard  action  on

the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing

as desired:

The  ceaseless  chaos  representing  images  of  surface

thoughts.

Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.

Information from all minds about one particular topic, thing,

or being, one nugget of information per caster level.

A study of the thoughts and memories of one creature of

the group in detail.

Once  per  round,  if  you  do  not  perform  a  detailed  study  of

one creatures mind, you can attempt (as a standard action)

to implant a suggestion in the mind of any one of the affected

creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw

to resist the suggestion, using the save DC of the brain spider.

(Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can

use this resistance to keep from being affected by the sugges-

tion.) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other

effects of the brain spider for that creature.

You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within

range  (up  to  the  limit  of  eight),  beginning  with  known  or

named beings. Language is not a barrier, and you need not

personally know the beingsyou can choose, for instance, the

nearest eight guards who must be in that chamber there. The

spell cannot reach those who make a successful Will save.

Spell resistance applies to the damage dealt by this spell but

not to the darkness area.

Arcane  Material  Component:  A  dollop  of  pitch  with  a  tiny

needle hidden inside it.

DARKBOLT

Evocation [Darkness, Evil]

Level: Cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, Vile Darkness 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster makes a ranged touch attack against a foe, launching

a bolt of cold darkness from his left hand. The bolt deals 1d8

points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). Half the

damage is cold, and the other has no speci c type. When struck,

the foe must also succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for

1 round, overwhelmed by the evil charge of the darkbolt.

DESPOIL

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Cleric 9, Corruption 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Area: 100 ft./level radius

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial (plants) or Fortitude negates

Material Component: A spider of any size or kind. It can be

(other living creatures)

dead, but it must still have all eight legs.

Spell Resistance: Yes

DAMNING DARKNESS

Evocation [Darkness, Evil]

Level: Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, Vile Darkness 4

Components: V, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Object touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: See below

This spell is similar to darkness, except that those within the

area of darkness also take unholy damage. Creatures of good

alignment take 2d6 points of damage per round in the dark-

ness, and creatures neither good nor evil take 1d6 points of

damage. As with the darkness spell, the area of the darkness

is  a  20-foot  radius,  and  the  object  that  serves  as  the  spells

target can be shrouded to block the darkness (and thus the

damaging effect).

Damning darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal

210

or lower level.

The caster blights and corrupts a vast area of land. Plants with 1

Hit Die or less shrivel and die, and the ground cannot support

such plant life ever again. Plants with more than 1 Hit Die must

succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or die. Even those success-

ful on their saves take 5d6 points of damage. All living creatures

in the area other than plants (and the caster) must succeed on a

Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 points of Strength damage.

Unattended objects, including structural features such as

walls and doors, grow brittle and lose 1 point of hardness (to a

minimum of 0), then take 1d6 points of damage (this damage

bypasses any remaining hardness).

Only the effects of multiple wish or miracle spells can undo

the lasting effect of this spell.

Material Component: Corpse of a freshly dead or preserved

living creature.

DETECT ABERRATION

Divination

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Each round, the character can turn to detect aberrant auras

in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of

stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet

of wood or dirt blocks it.

INVOKE THE CERULEAN SIGN

Evocation

Level: Bard 3, cleric 3, druid 2, paladin 3, ranger 2, sorcerer/

wizard 3

Components: S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 30 ft.

Area: Multiple aberrations whose combined total Hit Dice do

not exceed twice caster level in a spread emanating from the

character to the extreme of the range

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: No

The cerulean sign is an ancient symbol said to embody the purity

of the natural world, and as such it is anathema to aberrations.

Range: 60 ft.

Area:  Quarter  circle  emanating  from  the  character  to  the

extreme of the range

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You can detect the presence of all aberrations in the area. The

amount  of  information  revealed  depends  on  how  long  you

study a particular area or subject:

1st Round: Presence or absence of aberrant life.

2nd  Round:  Number  of  different  aberrant  auras  and  the

strength of the strongest aura. If you detect overwhelming

aberrant power with this spell, and the Hit Dice or level of

the auras source is at least twice your character level, you are

stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.

3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura.

Aura Power: An aberrant auras power depends on the type

of creature youre detecting and its Hit Dice; see the accompa-

nying table. If an aura falls into more than one power category,

the spell indicates the stronger of the two. A humanoid with

the Aberration Blood feat detects as Faint even if it has more

than 3 Hit Dice.

While druids and rangers are the classes most often known

to cast this ancient spell, its magic is nearly universal and can

be mastered by all spellcasting classes.

When you cast this spell, you trace the cerulean sign in the air

with a hand, leaving a glowing blue rune in the air for a brief

moment before it  ashes and  lls the area of effect with a pulse

of cerulean light. Any aberration within the area must make

a  Fortitude saving throw or suffer the following ill effects.

Closer aberrations are affected  rst.

MADDENING SCREAM

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Madness 8

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Duration: 1d4+1 rounds

Effect

None

Sickened

Nauseated

Dazed

Stunned

Each effect lasts for 1 round.

None: The aberration suffers no ill effect, even if it fails the

saving throw.

Sickened: The aberration takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls,

saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round.

Nauseated: The aberration cannot attack, cast spells, concen-

trate on spells, or do anything but take a single move action

for 1 round.

Dazed: The aberration can take no actions, but has no penalty

to its Armor Class, for 1 round.

Stunned: The aberration drops everything held, cant take

actions, takes a 2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus

to AC (if any) for 1 round.

Once a creature recovers from an effect, it moves up one

level  on  the  table.  Thus,  a  creature  that  is  stunned  by  this

spell is dazed the round after that, nauseated the round after

that, sickened the round after that, and then recovers fully

the next round.

INVOKE MAGIC

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round

The subject cannot keep himself from screaming, gibbering,

and leaping about as though completely mad. This spell makes

it impossible for the victim to do anything other than race

about caterwauling. The spell gives the subject a 4 penalty to

Armor Class, makes Re ex saving throws impossible except

on a roll of 20, and makes it impossible to use a shield.

MORALITY UNDONE

Enchantment [Evil, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 5, cleric 5, Corruption 4

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One nonevil creature

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster turns one creature evil. The chaotic/neutral/lawful

component of the subjects alignment is unchanged. The sub-

ject retains whatever outlook, allegiances, and relationships

it  had  before,  as  long  as  they  do  not  con ict  with  the  new

alignment. Otherwise, it acts with its new sel sh, bloodthirsty,

and cruel outlook on all things.

For example, a wizard might not immediately turn on her

 ghter companion for no apparent reason, particularly in the

middle of a combat when theyre  ghting on the same side.

But she might allow her friend to be hurt or killed if her friend

is carrying something valuable she could recover later, or she

might use spells to control or deceive her friend to get what

she wants. She might even eventually decide to betray or attack

her friend if there is some potential gain involved.

Arcane Material Component: A powdered holy symbol.

You cause a  icker of magic to momentarily exist in a place

where magic cannot normally function, such as within the area

of an antimagic  eld, a dead magic area, or a null-magic plane.

This allows you the ability to cast a single spell of 4th level or

lower, which then ends the spells effect.

Casting invoke magic is a swift action, like casting a quick-

ened spell. You can perform only one swift action each round.

Normally, you cast invoke magic and then immediately follow

it by casting another spell as a standard action.

Material Component: A diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.

NATURES PURITY

Evocation

Level: Druid 3

A shimmering green beam of light springs forth from your

outstretched hand. You can direct this ray at any target in range.

If you hit the target, the ray deals 1d6 points of force damage.

Against undead and constructs, the ray deals 2d8 points of

force damage.

Against aberrations, the ray deals 5d6 points of force damage

and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 1920. An aberration

slain by this damage is immediately transformed into pungent-

smelling inert plant matter.

You  can  generate  one  additional  ray  for  every  four  levels

above 5th (to a maximum of four rays at 17th level). The rays

can be  red at the same or different targets, but all rays must

be  aimed  at  targets  within  30  feet  of  each  other  and   red

simultaneously.

All the subjects memories and knowledge are accessible to you,

ranging from memories deep below the surface to those still

easily called to mind. You can learn the answer to one question

per round, to the best of the subjects knowledge. You can also

probe a sleeping subject, though the subject can make a Will

save against the DC of the probe thoughts spell to wake after each

question. Subjects who do not wish to be probed can attempt

to move beyond the powers range, unless somehow hindered.

You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those

questions  are  imparted  directly  to  your  mind.  You  and  the

target do not need to speak the same language, although less

intelligent creatures might yield up only appropriate visual

images in answer to your questions.

the creatures internal organs constantly seethe and slither about,

and actively avoid being struck at by weapons. For the duration

of the spell, the target is immune to extra damage from critical

hits and sneak attacks. Additionally, the target takes minimum

possible damage from falls and gains a +4 enhancement bonus

on all saving throws against poison, disease, and paralysis.

Utterdark spreads outward from you, creating an area of cold,

cloying  magical  darkness.  This  darkness  is  similar  to  that

created by the deeper darkness spell, but it cannot be dispelled

by  magical  light  (although  a  light  spell  or  similar  effect  of

equal or higher level can temporarily suppress the utterdark

where their areas overlap, restoring normal illumination to

the affected area for as long as the light spell or effect lasts).

MAGIC ITEMS

Naturally, aberrations carefully guard the secrets of creating

grafts and other unique items.

Amulet of Inviolate Form: This mystic amulet

is set with seven red garnets. Whenever the wearer

is subjected to a spell or effect that would signi -

cantly change her bodily form or composition, she

can expend one charge to negate the transformation.

She must decide whether to use the charge before she

attempts a saving throw. Effects that the amulet

protects against include polymorph, petri cation,

gaseous form, and transformative attacks such as

the  touch  of  an  aboleths  tentacle  or  a

chaos beast. The amulet has 7 charges,

one for each garnet; the garnets turn dull

black as charges are expended.

Moderate  abjuration;  CL  9th;

Craft  Wondrous  Item,  break

enchantment; Price 11,000 gp.

Chuulface Mask: This chi-

tinous mask merges with its

wearers  esh when worn,

but can be removed easily as

a full-round action. As long as the mask

is worn, the wearers lower face becomes

transformed into a mass of long red tentacles

within a chitinous mandible. His upper face

is a smooth shell with tiny beady eyes. The

user  can  still  speak  (albeit  in  a  sloshing,

gurgling  voice),  but  any  spell  with  a  verbal

component has a 10% spell failure chance.

As long as it is worn, the wearer can breathe

water and has darkvision out to 60 feet. If the

user manages to establish a grapple on a creature, he can make

a touch attack with the tentacles of the mask once per round as

a free action. A creature struck by these tentacles must make a

DC 19 Fortitude saving throw or be paralyzed for 6 rounds.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL  7th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

darkvision, hold  monster,  water  breathing;  Price  65,000  gp;

Weight 1 lb.

a rod of freedom

The Codex Anathema: This infamous book was written by

the wizard Iphegor of the Ebon Mirror. It has been copied on

rare occasions since. It records terrible knowledge of distant

times, alien worlds, and various aberrations. If anyone reads

this  book  (a  minimum  of  48  hours  over  at  least  six  days),

she gains an inherent bonus of +2 to her Intelligence score,

but loses 2 points from her Wisdom score. In addition, she

gains  5  ranks  of  Knowledge  (dungeoneering),  2  ranks  of

Knowledge (arcana), and 2 ranks of Knowledge (the planes).

Once the book is read, the magic disappears from its pages

214

and it becomes a normal bookstill  lled with disturbing

and frightful images, but no longer capable of granting its

reader any bonuses or penalties.

Strong divination; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, foresight,

vision, creator must have read another Codex Anathema (magical

or discharged); Price 37,500 gp; Weight 5 lb.

Dust of Negation: This  ne purple powder comes in a

folded paper packet. When cast into the air, the dust creates

a cloud of faint violet sparkles in a

10-foot  spread  from  the  point  of

origin.  This  cloud  functions  as

an  antimagic   eld,  negating  all

magic  effects  within  the  area.

The  cloud  persists  for  2

minutes  (or  2  rounds  in

windy conditions).

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th;

Craft  Wondrous  Item,  antimagic

 eld; Price 3,300 gp.

Ring of Lightning Flash-

es:  Made  from  interwoven

bands of copper and electrum,

a ring  of  lightning   ashes  offers  a

unique defense against mon-

sters  that  grapple,  engulf,

swallow,  or  otherwise  get

entirely too close to the wearer.

As a purely mental standard action, the wearer can

cause the ring to emit a powerful blast of lightning

that deals 5d6 points of electricity damage (Re ex

DC 13 half) to all other creatures within 5 feet.

Any creature that is currently in physical contact

with the rings wearer (grappling, engul ng,

and  so  forth)  receives  no  saving  throw

against the blast. The rings wearer can

invoke the lightning  ash even when

grappled, swallowed, engulfed, or para-

lyzed. A ring of lightning  ashes is usable

three times per day.

Faint  evocation;  CL  5th;  Forge  Ring,  lightning  bolt;  Price

11,250 gp.

Rod of Freedom: A potent weapon against monsters that

charm or enslave other creatures, a rod of freedom is the equiva-

lent of a +3 silver heavy mace. It has three special powers.

First, the user can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no

penalty on her attack rolls. (She must decide before she makes

the attack roll if she will deal lethal or nonlethal damage.)

Second, any time she uses the rod to strike a creature that is

under a charm or compulsion effect, she makes a special caster

level check (1d20+9) to dispel the effect (DC 11 + caster level

of the effect). A rod of freedom  can be used  ve times per day.

Third, as long as the rod of freedom is in her hand, the user

gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm or

compulsion effects.

Moderate evocation; CL 9th; Craft Rod, break enchantment;

Price 53,000 gp; Weight 6 lb.

GRAFTS

Aboleth Grafts

Aberrations, more than other creatures, are naturally drawn

to the practice of grafting new body parts to living creatures.

Some  aberrations  do  so  to  enhance  their  own  strengths  or

shore up their weaknesses, while others focus on thralls and

slaves gathered from lesser races and use grafts as ways to

improve their minions. Aboleths, beholders, and illithids are

well known practitioners of these arts, and numerous examples

of grafts developed by these races can be found in Fiend Folio.

This section presents several more grafts developed by these

races, along with those used by other aberrations such as

avolakias (Monster Manual II page 28), ethergaunts (Fiend

Folio page 64), silthilars, and even creatures from the

Far Realm such as the kaorti.

Grafts have no statistics of their own. A graft

might enhance some ability or characteristic

of the creature its attached to, or it might

grant the creature some new ability.

The effects of grafts are extraordi-

nary abilities, meaning that they do

not fail to function in an antimagic  eld

or  similar  area.  However,  they  must

be created much like magic items are.

The creation process includes the act of

applying the graft to the creature it is

meant for. A character with the Graft

Flesh  feat  (see  the  sidebar)  can  create

and apply grafts. The creator must be in

a quiet and comfortable setting, most

commonly an alchemical laboratory

but in some cases an evil temple or

similar  locale.  He  needs  a  supply

of materials, which involves taking

 esh  from  another  creature  of  the

appropriate kind. The cost for the mate-

rials is subsumed in the cost of creating the

graft.  Creating  a  graft  costs  half  the  given

market price.

If spells are included in the prerequisites for

making the graft, the creator must have pre-

pared the spells to be cast, must know the

spells (in the case of a sorcerer or bard),

or must have access to spell-like abilities that duplicate the

spells. The creator need not provide any material components

or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs inherent in a

prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of the graft. The act

of working on the graft expends the spells from the creators

currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.

Even if magic was used in its creation, a graft does not radi-

ate magic once completed, it does not count against a creatures

limit for magic items worn, it does not have a caster level, and

it is very dif cult, if not impossible, to salvage as treasure. It

does  count  against  the  treasure  value  of  the  creature  with

the  graft,  which  means  that  creatures  with  grafts  are  still

appropriate  challenges  for  their  normal  CR,  but  they  have

reduced treasure.

Aboleths  typically  apply  grafts  to  creatures  that  they  have

already  transformed  with  their  mucus,  or  to  creatures  that

they have created, such as skum. An aboleth graft applied to

any  other  creature  dries  up  and  withers  over  the  course  of

1d4+1 days, falling off at the end of this period. At this point,

a regenerate spell is required to restore the original body part,

or a new graft can be applied.

Amphibious Skin: This invasive graft can only be applied

to a creature with the aquatic subtype. It replaces the grafted

creatures skin entirely with a thick membrane. The grafted

creature gains the amphibious special quality, allowing

it to breathe both air and water.

Graft Flesh (aboleth), creator must be an aboleth;

Price 30,000 gp.

Inksac:  An  inksac  is  normally  placed

inside a creatures abdomen; a vent protrudes

just  beyond  the  surface  of  the  creatures

skin above each hip. Once per minute as a

free action, the creature can emit a cloud

of jet-black ink in a spread with a radius of

twice the creatures natural reach. This cloud

provides concealment to all creatures in the

area.  Even  creatures  that  can  normally

see  in  such  conditions  (such  as  with

darkvision or low-light vision) are affected

by concealment when in a cloud of ink.

Only a daylight spell (or a higher-level

light  spell)  can  allow  creatures

in the area to see. The ink cloud

does not form unless the creature

is in water; on land it just spews out

as a big inky mess.

Graft Flesh (aboleth), creator must

be an aboleth; Price 9,000 gp.

A troll with an

aboleth graft

Mucus  Projector:  This  graft

consists of a large,  eshy sac with a

tubelike extension. It is typically grafted onto a creatures

back so the tube can extend up over a shoulder. A creature with

a mucus projector can activate it once every 1d4 rounds as a

standard action. When activated, it contracts violently and sprays

a thin stream of aboleth mucus out of the tube. The creature

must make a ranged touch attack to strike its intended target,

which must be within 30 feet. On a hit, the target must succeed

on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 grafted creatures HD + grafted

creatures Con modi er) or begin to transform as if struck by

an aboleths slime (see page 8 of the Monster Manual). A mucus

projector works equally well on the surface or underwater.

Graft  Flesh  (aboleth),  creator  must  be  an  aboleth;  Price

36,000 gp.

Waterjet: This long, thin tube is normally grafted onto a

creatures back. The grafted creature can use this graft once

per minute while swimming to double its normal swim speed

for 1 round.

Graft  Flesh  (aboleth),  creator  must  be  an  aboleth;  Price

2,500 gp.

215

Illithid Grafts

Illithids use grafts on their thralls to make them more useful

in combat against the mind  ayers enemies, or to make them

more  ef cient  at  whatever  menial  task  they  are  best  suited

for. Illithid grafts weaken the will of the individual they are

grafted onto; a creature with an illithid graft has a 4 penalty

on Will saves against mind-affecting spells and abilities, and

psionic powers.

Burrowing Claws: This graft replaces both of the recipi-

ents hands with thick- ngered claws tipped with iron-hard

ridges. The recipient gains a 4 penalty on Disable Device,

Open Lock, and Sleight of Hand checks, but gains a burrow

speed of 20 feet. The creature can even burrow through solid

stone or any other material with hardness of no more than

8. The claws allow the creature to deal lethal damage with

its  unarmed  strikes.  Illithids  gift  thralls  with  these  grafts

when they need to expand a caverns size or dig new tunnels

through the stony ground.

Graft  Flesh  (illithid),  creator  must  be  an  illithid;  Price

30,000 gp.

Darksight Eyes: These pale, pupilless eyes are similar in

appearance to the eyes of an illithid. The graft recipient gains

darkvision out to 60 feet. Illithids graft these eyes into favored

thralls that can more easily accomplish their jobs in the light-

less underground if they can see.

Graft  Flesh  (illithid),  creator  must  be  an  illithid;  Price

24,000 gp.

Mind Blast Relay: This strange graft is implanted into the

depths of the grafted creatures brain. The graft gives the creature

complete  immunity  to  mind  blasts.  Further,  any  mind   ayer

within 60 feet of a creature with a mind blast relay graft can auto-

matically detect the graft when it uses telepathy on that creature.

A mind  ayer can then choose to relay its mind blast attack into

that creature by activating its own mind blast. Once the mind blast

is relayed, the mind  ayer can choose to either allow the mind

blast to manifest (in which case it does so in a 20-foot-radius blast

centered on the grafted creature) or to relay it to a new creature

with a mind blast relay within 20 feet of the current creature. A

mind  ayer can continue to relay its mind blast as a free action

again and again until it gets to the mind blast relay it desires, at

which point the creature allows it to manifest. Each time a mind

blast is relayed, the DC to save against its effect is reduced by 2. A

mind  ayer must maintain line of sight to each creature in the

chain of mind blast relays, but otherwise the only practical limit

to the usefulness of this graft is the number of relays available

and the original save DC of the illithids mind blast.

Graft  Flesh  (illithid),  creator  must  be  an  illithid;  Price

50,000 gp.

Silthilar Grafts

Although they once used these grafts on themselves to great

success, the silthilars current incarnation as hivemind swarms

makes it impossible for them to continue the practice. Yet the

silthilar are loath to give up the skills and tradition. Silthilar

have taken to providing these grafts to paying customers. They

have also been known to provide grafts to allies or friends who

perform services for them.

Silthilar grafts function only when applied to a living cor-

poreal creature; applied to any other creature, they rot away

over the course of 2d4 days.

Chitin Plating: This graft consists of numerous interlock-

ing chitin plates grafted onto the creatures skin. These plates

are tough, yet  exible, and grant the recipient a natural armor

bonus ranging from +1 to +5. This natural armor bonus does

not  stack  with  any  other  natural  armor  bonus  the  creature

might possess as a virtue of his race, but it does stack with

enhancement bonuses to natural armor granted by magic such

as barkskin or an amulet of natural armor.

Graft Flesh (silthilar); Price 4,000 gp (+1), 16,000 gp (+2),

36,000 gp (+3), 64,000 gp (+4), 100,000 gp (+5).

Flexible Spine: This invasive graft replaces the creatures

spine, including the spinal cord, with a much more  exible

and ef cient set of nerves and vertebrae. The graft grants a

+4 racial bonus on initiative checks, Balance checks, Escape

Artist checks, and Tumble checks.

Graft Flesh (silthilar), regenerate; Price 91,000 gp.

Extended  Legs:  This  graft  extends  the  creatures  legs,

making it taller and faster. The creatures height increases by

5%, but this does not increase the creatures size category. The

creatures base land speed increases by 5 feet.

Graft Flesh (silthilar), longstrider; Price 91,000 gp.

Healing Blood: This unique graft consists of a total transfu-

sion of blood. The creatures original blood supply is drained

completely and replaced with a similar  uid that grants the

grafted creature fast healing 2.

Graft Flesh (silthilar), regenerate; Price 182,000 gp.

Rudimentary Eyespots: This graft consists of several patches

of light-sensitive skin placed on the back of the grafted creatures

neck and the back of each hand. These patches improve the

grafted creatures vision, granting it a +4 bonus on Spot checks.

In addition, the creature can no longer be  anked.

Graft Flesh (silthilar), regenerate; Price 60,000 gp.

GRAFT FLESH [ITEM CREATION]

You can apply a certain type of graft to other living creatures

or to yourself.

Prerequisite: Heal 10 ranks.

Benefit: Choose a type of graft: aboleth, illithid, or silthilar.

You must be an aboleth to choose aboleth grafts. You must be

an illithid to choose illithid grafts. There are no additional re-

quirements for choosing silthilar grafts. Other races aside from

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

these three can create grafts; see the Fiend Folio for beholder,

fiendish, undead, and yuan-ti grafts.

You can create grafts of your chosen type and apply them to

other creatures or to yourself. Creating a graft takes one day for

each 1,000 gp in its price. To create a graft, you must spend 1/25

of the grafts price in XP and use up raw materials costing half

this price.

DEFENDERS OF HUMANITY

Armed  with  superior  intellects,  ancient  lore,  abominable

magic, and terrifying physical capabilities, master aberrations

seem undefeatable. Fortunately for all humans (and other good-

hearted folk), brave and resolute heroes choose to interpose

themselves between the civilizations of humankind and the

creeping threat from the darkness. Some of these heroes are

independent agents, freelancers, and crusaders who serve no

master but their own conscience. Others serve as foot soldiers

for holy orders or secret societies determined to oppose the

aberration threat.

While several organizations are described here, these are

not  the  only  orders  devoted  to   ghting  aberrations.  Any

organization of good-aligned creatures naturally battles against

any aberration scheme that threatens the world around them.

For example, the church of Heironeous might host the Topaz

Order, but clerics and warriors sworn to the service of Pelor,

Kord, or Obad-Hai gladly take up arms against creatures such

as beholders and mind  ayers at any opportunity.

prefers to let its members  nd their own way into becoming

abolishers. Only by proving ones hatred of aberrant life by

devoting oneself to this prestige class can a character earn an

invitation into the Circle. New abolishers are contacted by a

member of the Circle before they reach 2nd or 3rd level as an

abolisher, and the offer is almost always the same: Join the

Circle and  nd both companionship and support. There are

no entry fees or other requirements.

A character who wishes to contact the Order of the True

without  having  demonstrated  amply  how  she  opposes

aberrations  nds that doing so is dif cult. She must  nd a

location where abolishers are known to live, and then make

a DC 25 Gather Information check. If the PC has publicly

demonstrated  her  opposition  to  aberrant  life,  she  receives

a +4 circumstance bonus on the check. If the PC or one of

her allies or cohorts is an aberration, give her a +10 bonus on

the check, but any abolishers who contact her have an initial

attitude of hostile.

Sample Member

Aurah Lirilian became an abolisher after she survived a savage

attack on her small coastal hometown by a band of skum led by

an aboleth. Aurah fell victim to the aboleths slime before the

creature was driven off by the efforts of a band of mercenaries

that fortunately happened to be in town. Unfortunately, the

majority of the rest of the town perished in the raid, including

both of Aurahs parents and her two brothers. Horri ed at the

transformation  the  aboleths  slime  had  in icted  on  her  and

distraught at the loss of her family, Aurah  ed up the coast.

She lived in a small sea cave for several years, growing closer to

nature despite her apparently incurable skin condition. It wasnt

until she witnessed a pair of chuuls orchestrate the wreck of a

small merchant ship on a reef near her cave that her anger took

focus. She came to the rescue of the ship and single-handedly

used  her  magic  to  slaughter  the  two  chuuls;  the  owners  of

the ship were so grateful that they paid for the heal spell that

restored her skin. Word of Aurahs aid spread quickly, and before

long she was recruited into the Circle of the True.

Aurah  is  a  typically  grim  abolisher  who  has  founded  a

coastal branch of the Circle of the True near the ruins of her

hometown. She takes a particular interest in coastal-dwelling

aberrations, although she might recruit any PC abolisher who

comes to her attention.

CIRCLE OF THE TRUE

The  path  taken  by  the  abolisher  (see  page  182)  is  one  born

of deep personal tragedy and rage. The abolishers hatred of

aberrations fuels her specialized powers, yet it also leaves her

with profound loneliness and alienation. Partially to combat

these feelings and partially to pool their resources, abolishers

maintain a fairly close-knit community among themselves.

The Circle of the True is an organization composed of those

who would see nature triumph over the aberrant, and many

of their members are abolishers.

Unlike  organizations  that  train  their  members  in  a  spe-

cialized form of combat or magic use, the Circle of the True

DARKRUNNER GUILD

To  many,  the  subterranean  reaches  might  seem  an  in nite

maze of chambers and corridors impossible to navigate. Yet

one organization has made a tidy pro t doing just that. The

Darkrunner Guild consists of those who explore, chart, and

discover the hidden secrets of the world below.

The  guild  is  represented  to  some  degree  in  almost  all

sizable underground settlements, and even in a few of the

larger surface cities. Most of their members have at least a

few  levels  in  the  darkrunner  prestige  class,  although  this

isnt required to become a member. The reverse is not quite

as true; the few darkrunners who dont belong to the guild

are almost always rogues who live as mercenaries or nomads.

Its best to avoid confrontations with guildless darkrunners,

since they tend to be insane at best and remorseless brigands

at worst. Only the aberrant underground races eschew the

valuable skills and lore possessed by the guild, often to their

disadvantage.

Membership in the guild has several advantages. A guild

member  is  virtually  guaranteed  a  safe  place  to  rest  in  any

large subterranean city; the guild has safe houseseven in

normally inhospitable drow and duergar settlementsthat

welcome members of all races. Likewise, guild houses typically

have several spellcasters living on site, their services offered

at a 75% discount to members. Members of the guild can also

sell and buy magic items at better costs; typically 10% over or

under list price. Of course, membership isnt free. A member

of  the  Darkrunner  Guild  is  expected  to  stay  on  top  of  the

monthly  dues,  which  operate  on  a  sliding  scale.  Entrance

dues are 500 gp per character level, and yearly dues thereafter

drop to 100 gp per character level. Levels of the darkrunner

prestige class do not count when determining how much you

owe.  Of  course,  the  guild  wont  accept  just  anyone  into  its

ranks. Typically, an applicant needs to have at least 5 ranks in

Knowledge (dungeoneering) and at least 7 ranks in Survival

before she is considered for membership.

Members of the guild hire themselves out as spies, explor-

ers, or underground guides. Prices vary from region to region

and according to the danger of the job, but typically a member

can  expect  to  be  paid  no  less  than  5  gp  per  character  level

(darkrunner levels count double) per day.

Sample Member

Jasper Ringlerock only just recently joined the Darkrunner

Guild after proving his worth by sneaking through a large nest

of cloakers to map a particularly tangled warren of caverns

located below a haunted grell outpost. Jasper is eager to build

on his reputation in the guild before news of this accomplish-

ment is eclipsed by some new stunt by another darkrunner.

As  a  result,  he  might  be  a  bit  too  exuberant  and  daring  in

his tactics. A party that hires him is guaranteed to get more

than they bargained for when Jasper tries to lead them on a

shortcut through the basements of a mind  ayer outpost or a

long-abandoned deep dragon lair.

Jasper is a cheerful hal ing who has yet to really encounter

actual failure or defeat. He knows that most of his past suc-

cesses are thanks mostly to luck, but he  gures that he can

handle whatever his good luck cant.

SOCIETY OF THE SANCTIFIED MIND

This groups members dedicate themselves to combating the

machinations of evil psionics-using creatures wherever they

can be found.

The society considers its mission a crusade to rid the world

of evil psionics-users, or at the very least to minimize their

219

in uence. The order was run until recently by its founder, Sir

Jeremy Costineux, a high-level cleric of St. Cuthbert. Although

his aged body is now too frail to lead his knights in battle, Sir

Jeremys mind remains as sharp as ever.

The society was born thirty years ago when a group of mind

 ayers that lived under the mountains near Sir Jeremys small

home village attacked the town in a brain raid. Every living

man, woman, and child that was not killed by the illithids or

their  mind-controlled  thralls  was  captured  and  taken  deep

underground.

Jeremy  (his  knighthood  would  come  later)  was  already  a

devoted  adventuring  cleric  in  service  to  St.  Cuthbert.  The

journeys  he  and  his  compatriots  took  to  vanquish  evil  and

chaos led them far from home. The attack on his home village

occurred while Jeremy and his allies were hundreds of miles

away, helping a druid named Melis and her small band of elf

followers repel the attacks of a band of bugbears, ogres, and

trolls. It wasnt until months after the raid that Jeremy returned

to the abandoned ruins of what had been his home.

It  didnt  take  him  and  his  comrades  long  to  determine

that illithids were behind the attack, and the party headed

underground to rescue any villagers who remained alive and

heap bloody revenge upon the tentacled heads of the mind

 ayers.

The illithids had learned much about Jeremy and his allies

from  reading  (and  digesting)  the  minds  of  his  family  and

friends,  and  thus  they  were  prepared  when  Jeremy  came

looking for them. After they sprang their trap, Jeremy was the

only member of the party to survive and escape back to the

surface. He was aided by Albaric, a dwarf  ghter/rogue the

mind  ayers had recently captured while snooping around

the edges of the mind  ayers subterranean home.

The pair returned to civilization, reported the events that

had  occurred  to  the  government,  and  then  returned  to  the

region, reinforced with powerful allies. They destroyed the

nest  of   ayers,  but  Jeremy  remained  unsatis ed.  Hed  lost

almost everyone close to him to the illithids, and he vowed

to do all in his power to spare others that same torment. He

also had the foresight to realize that mind  ayers were not the

only threat to surface civilization. He knew that any group of

psionics-using creatures with a penchant for enslaving weak

minds could have eliminated his home just as quickly, and he

broadened his focus to include all creatures that used psion-

ics to further their dark and evil goals. The allies Jeremy and

Albaric brought with them pledged to join his crusade. When

the  group  returned  to  the  capital,  the  authorities  of cially

sanctioned  the  society,  made  Jeremy  a  knight  in  service  to

his country, and appointed him commandant. Albaric took

his place as Sir Jeremys adjutant.

Sir Jeremy ran the society along militaristic lines, taking his

inspiration from the knightly order of St. Cuthbert in ages past.

This policy attracted a certain type of adventurer to the society

in its early years: Lawful  ghters, paladins, clerics, and monks

made up most of the groups ranks. This strict adherence to

doctrine and tradition served the group well, as it suffered as

many setbacks as victories early on.

It was only later that, upon Albarics insistence, Sir Jeremy

made  the  society  less  formal,  more  open,  and  less  closely

aligned  with  his  own  church  hierarchy.  In  the  time  since,

bards, druids, rangers, sorcerers, and wizards, as well as mem-

bers of the psionic classes, have joined the society in greater

numbers. This diversity of talent and viewpoints strengthens

the group in its ongoing crusade.

Feeling  that  the  society  needed  a  strong  battle eld  com-

mander to succeed, Sir Jeremy recently resigned his post and

named Albaric as his replacement.

Albaric hopes to expand the ranks of the society even further

by offering the orders special training in combating psionics-

using creatures to all members of the group, not just to the

humans, as was Sir Jeremys practice. He has also promoted

younger members of the society, especially those undergoing

the orders special training, to new positions of responsibility

in the  eld and in the societys ward houses.

SAMPLE MEMBER

Korrath  grew  up  in  one  of  St.  Cuthberts  martyrs  orphan-

ages, never having known his parents or what caused their

deaths. As he aged, his piety, strength, and willpower came

to be noticed by the church of cials, and he was approached

by members of the society. At the time, he wished merely to

serve his deity in valorous battle, not waste his time studying

such rare, esoteric, and, possibly mythical foes. Korrath chose

his path and excelled at it, becoming a hero of the church.

Perhaps the adulation that he earned led to overcon dence,

but  an  event  a  few  years  ago  brought  Korraths  path  back

toward the society.

Korrath  and  his  allies  were  pursing  a  band  of  what  they

thought  were  drow  slavers.  Instead,  they  unknowingly  fol-

lowed a party of mind  ayers, their thralls, and the captives

they had recently gained in a brain raid. Korrath led the charge

to free the prisoners once the heroes caught up with the large

party, only to discover, to his horror, that the illithids were now

trying to kill him. Korrath fought like a true warrior of St.

Cuthbert; his fury was such that no illithid could lay a tentacle

on himbut his martial prowess didnt protect him from the

illithids psionic powers. Through circumstances he claims to

be unable to recall, Korrath fell under the mind  ayers mental

domination and turned on his allies, attacking them while

protecting the mind  ayers. In one brief moment of clarity,

he hesitated in his assault. His oldest friend, a paladin named

Illyria, didnt notice the  icker of cognizance in his eyes and

struck Korrath down.

When he regained consciousness, Korrath discovered that

Illyria had dragged him clear of the battle and healed the most

grievous of his wounds. What else she might have planned,

Korrath can never know, for he found her body not far off. Her

skull was torn open like a burst melon and her brain was gone,

food for one of the mind  ayers. Korrath found no evidence

that any other of his comrades survived the battle, but he did

not  nd their bodies as he had Illyrias.

Left with little choice and less hope, Korrath returned to the

temple his party used as its base and asked to speak with Albaric

Since being accepted into its ranks, his previous experience

and  newfound  devotion  to  eliminating  evil  psionics-using

creatures (especially mind  ayers) everywhere have brought

him success. In fact, Albaric recently promoted Korrath to the

rank of adjutant of the societys ward house in a major city.

THE TOPAZ ORDER

A militant order of crusading clerics,  ghters, paladins,

and monks in the service of Heironeous, the Holy Order

of the Supernal Topaz Defenders stands as a dedicated

shield  protecting  humankind  from  the  depredations  of

aberrant  master  races  and  other  monstrosities.  The

topaz guardians are warriors who pit their virtue and

determination against the mind-poisoning horrors

of aberrant monsters, trusting that holy steel and

divine  blessing  can  overcome  alien  magic  and

his  psionic  focus  to  smite  a  psionics-using

creature with one melee attack (including

melee touch attacks). He gains a +1 bonus

on his attack roll and deals an extra 4d6

points of damage. If he smites a creature

that is not a psionics-user, the cleansing

strike has no effect, but the ability is still

used up for the day.

A paladin undergoes the

ceremony to gain membership

in the Topaz Order

crawling death.

Vigilance is the watchword of the Topaz

Order.  Members  of  the  order  are  free  to

pursue their own individual duties and

interests, but wherever they go,

they  keep  a  sharp  eye  out  for

evidence of aberrant incursions.

report encountering monsters such as mind  ayers, they search

out rumored outposts and lairs, and they investigate any signs

of  aberration  predationabductions,  mysterious  murders,

important people behaving oddly, people reporting missing

memories or frightening encounters with malevolent strang-

ers. Should a topaz guardian encounter an aberration incursion,

he sends word to the nearest temple of Heironeous to spread

the alarm to all nearby chapters of the Topaz Order.

While the topaz guardians are expected to act independently,

they share many common bonds. The order trains its chosen

champions in specialized combat techniques effective against

aberrations, and equips them with their signature device, the

topaz diadem. Within the chapter house (or most temples of

Heironeous, for that matter), a topaz guardian can  nd lodging,

fellowship, and support for his lonely crusade.

Sample Member

Halvar Marth grew up on the border marches of the Gnarley

Forest.  As  a  simple  woodsman  and  hunter,  he  might  have

stayed  in  his  wilderness  home  for  his  entire  lifebut  one

awful night a neogi raid descended upon his homestead. The

neogi and their umber hulk slaves carried off several of his

kinfolk, and Halvar was nearly killed  ghting the creatures.

A couple of days after the raid, a knight of Heironeous named

Ferrsta Breith appeared in the ruined settlement and organized

a pursuit of the neogi. Halvar joined in, and under Ferrstas

leadership, they succeeded in slaying two of the monsters and

rescuing several of the neogis captives.

Ferrsta recognized Halvars great potential, and when she

left  the  tiny  settlement,  she  took  him  along.  She  brought

him  to  a  temple  of  Heironeous,  where  Halvar  took  up  the

vows of a paladin-in-training. Halvar dedicated his life to the

war against the neogi and other aberrations, and eventually

earned an invitation to follow in Ferrstas footsteps and join

the Topaz Order.

Halvar is a warm and good-humored man who makes light of

his grave duties. He views despair as a dangerous vulnerability,

and works hard to keep hope in his heart even in desperate situ-

ations, as Ferrsta Breith taught him long ago. Halvar believes

in the ability of ordinary people to meet great challenges, and

he has already inspired several other young warriors to take

up the diadem of the topaz guardian.

Lords of Madness details the D&D games most unusual

and unsettling creaturesthe aberrations. The book

also offers invaluable tips for overcoming these crea-

tures, as well as new feats, spells, and equipment based

on their abilities. In addition, several organizations

dedicated to the eradication of aberrations are pre-

sented.

The Flow of Fresh Brains is a short D&D adventure for

four 11th-level player characters (PCs). The scenario is

not setting-specific; you can place it in any populated

section of your campaign world that is a near a medium

or large city. The action begins along one of the major

trading routes between cities, then progresses to an

illithid nautiloid. As always, feel free to adapt the mate-

rial presented here as you see fit to make it work with

your campaign.

This adventure uses the horrific adventure guide-

lines presented on page 13 of Lords of Madness. Since the

encounter levels (ELs) of several encounters are higher

than normal for the character level of the PCs, charac-

ter death is a very real possibility. At the very least, the

PCs will find themselves severely taxed during this

adventure, so be sure to provide ample opportunities

for healing.

PREPARATION

You (the DM) need the D&D core rulebooksthe

Players Handbook, the Dungeon Masters Guide, and the

Monster Manualas well as the Expanded Psionics Hand-

book and Lords of Madnessto run this adventure. The

information presented here utilizes the D&D v.3.5

rules.

To get started, print out the adventure, including

the maps. Read through the scenario at least once to

familiarize yourself with the situation, threats, and

major NPCs (particularly their motivations). Text that

appears in shaded boxes is player information that you

can read aloud or paraphrase for the players at the

proper times. For monster and NPC statistics, refer to

either the Appendix or the appropriate pages in Monster

Manual or Lords of Madness.

MINIATURES

You may find that some of the miniatures produced by

Wizards of the Coast, Inc. greatly enhance your players

enjoyment of this adventure. The warbands presented

in a recent web article (http://www.wizards.com/

default.asp?x=dnd/mi/20050317a) are of particular

interest.

ADVENTURE

BACKGROUND

Mind flayers, otherwise known as illithids, are horrific

creatures that originated in the far future. Faced with

the imminent demise of their kind, they fled to the

past with their elder brain leaders, plus certain fero-

cious and twisted creatures that inhabited their home-

world, as well as numerous spacefaring ships called

nautiloids. Upon arrival, they took refuge in the dark

corners of various worlds and began to build their

empire anew by enslaving the native humanoid races.

Since then, the illithids have manipulated events in

both overt and subtle ways to assure the eventual evo-

lution of their own species.

Most of the illithids sought refuge beneath the sur-

faces of their new worlds, establishing colonies that

thrived and grew strong where the light of the sun

could not penetrate. However, a large number of them

avoided inhabited areas altogether and made their

homes among the stars instead. Several elder brains

and their illithid followers settled on small moons or

large asteroids, where they could plot out their future

without interference from the native creatures of the

inhabited worlds. But while this solution helped to

ensure the safety of the illithid masters, it also dis-

tanced the settlements from their primary food source:

the brains of sentient creatures. The vast majority of

the illithids in such stellar settlements addressed this

issue by using their plane shift ability to capture sentient

creatures for food. As luck would have it, however, a

few settlements were established on stellar bodies that

happened to be rich in valuable minerals. The residents

of these colonies quickly discovered that mining these

substances and trading them for living slaves presented

considerably less personal risk than any other means of

acquiring food. Deals were made, and avenues were

opened for slave trade with the inhabited worlds. As a

result,  several  nautiloids  now  ply  the  space  lanes

among the various illithid colonies, exchanging living

captives for gold, gems, and spices.

The illithid captain Xhuxuto commands a nautiloid

that services five asteroid settlements. A two-way gate

within the ship links to the subterranean stronghold of

a mercenary company with which Xhuxuto has main-

tained a long-standing relationship. Composed mostly

of humans, the Black Thorne Company rounds up

humanoids and brings them to Xhuxutos nautiloid for

transport to the various asteroid settlements. Xhuxuto

charges his clients twice what he pays the mercenaries

for the slaves, keeping the difference as pay for himself

and his crew.

The  Black  Thorne  Company  began  as  a  simple

group of highwaymen who brazenly defied the laws

and the protectors of their lands, waylaying travelers

and caravans with increasing frequency. Xhuxuto took

notice of the group as its infamy grew. Eventually, the

mind flayer contacted Narulin, the ruthless fighter

who led the band, and offered him a chance to gain

even more wealth from each raid by selling captives for

illithid consumption. Since the Black Thorne Com-

pany had quite a bit to gain from this arrangement and

nothing to lose, the leader agreed to a partnership with

the illithid captain.

Since then, the Black Thorne Company has become

even more infamous in the surrounding lands because

its members no longer leave survivors, or even corpses,

behind in the wake of an attack. Some claim the merce-

naries are cannibals; others insist that they are slavers.

Only the members of the company and their client,

however, know what really happens to victims of their

attacks. All live captives are turned over to the illithids,

and any corpses are taken back to the bands hideout

and fed to the kigrids that serve as their guards.

Xhuxutos nautiloid is a relic from the distant future

powered by magical technology that has not yet been

invented. The illithids run the ship with a skeleton

crew and do not even bother to man the weapons.

Since few if any spacefaring races exist at the present

time, the chances of attack by another ship during any

regular trading run are vanishingly small.

ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS

Several groups of travelers have recently disappeared

along a busy trade route. Investigation leads the PCs to

2

a cave complex, where they encounter several merce-

naries as well as numerous strange creatures belonging

to the illithidae family of monsters. In the innermost

chamber of the complex, they discover a magic portal.

PCs who pass through the portal find themselves in

the bowels of a nautiloid ship. After fighting their way

past numerous illithids and mercenaries, they can con-

front Narulin and Xhuxuto, the mercenary leader and

the nautiloid captain, respectively. If they defeat these

two leaders, they can rescue the people held in the nau-

tiloids slave deck. The PCs cannot control the ship,

however, so they must then decide whether to allow it

to drift in space, or destroy it before leaving.

ADVENTURE HOOKS

As DM, you know best how to involve your characters

in an adventure. However, if youre stuck for an idea,

you can use any of the following suggestions to draw

the PCs into the action.

While traveling along a busy trade route, the PCs are

attacked by a vicious band of thugs. The mercenaries

fight hard and seem particularly determined to win,

even though the PCs clearly outmatch them. After the

battle,  the  surviving  thugs  attempt  to  flee  under-

ground.  Any  thugs  who  are  captured  and  forced  to

talk  reveal  that  they  are  part  of  a  slaver  band  that

captures people and sells them to a mysterious client.

Lord  Dannis,  a  wealthy  noble,  was  expecting  his

nephew  Garris  to  arrive  in  town  two  days  ago.  The

young  man  was  traveling  by  coach  with  a  group  of

friends  from  a  nearby  city,  but  the  coach  never

arrived. Dannis has heard the recent tales of bold brig-

and  attacks,  and  he  fears  that  Garris  and  his  friends

have fallen prey to such a band of outlaws. Thus, the

nobleman has offered a 5,000-gp reward to any adven-

turers willing to track down his nephew and return

him safely.

The PCs belong to an organization that opposes aberra-

tions,  such  as  the  Circle  of  the  True,  the  Darkrunner

Guild, the Society of the Sanctified Mind, or the Topaz

Order (see Lords of Madness, pages 217222). Their organ-

ization has learned about the illithids covert activities in

this area through an informant who was once a member

of the Black Thorne Company. The leaders of the organ-

ization  have  passed  this  information  along  to  the  PCs

and asked them to investigate this matter and eliminate

the threat.

BEGINNING THE

ADVENTURE

The Flow of Fresh Brains is a site-based adventure in

which the action occurs in two places: inside the sub-

terranean stronghold of the Black Thorne Company,

and aboard Xhuxutos nautiloid ship.

You can place the Black Thorne hideout in any sub-

terranean area you desire, so long as it is near enough to

a city to permit easy acquisition of supplies. You must

decide how the PCs learn of its locationperhaps by

following the mercenaries after an attack, or by interro-

gating captured members of the company, or by some

form of divination. The journey to the stronghold is

uneventful, though you may add a random encounter

along the way if it lies some distance from the PCs base

of operations.

The adventure begins when the PCs approach the

dungeon that the Black Thorne Company uses as its

hideout.

A. BLACK THORNE

STRONGHOLD

The Black Thorne Company operates from a subter-

ranean stronghold dug out of a sandstone cliffside. Cre-

ated more than fifty years ago by a group of slave

traders, the cavern complex has been occupied by one

criminal organization after another ever since. Heroes

have cleared it out on more than one occasion, and one

group even went so far as to collapse the cave entrance,

but new villains continually re-excavate the complex.

The authorities of the nearby towns have dismissed the

complex as a possible hideout for the mercenary com-

pany that has been plaguing the roads because they

assume the interior of the cliff to be unreachable.

A1. ENTRANCE (EL 12)

The entrance to the stronghold is located on a ledge

midway up the face of a steep, forested cliff. When the

PCs reach the area outside the door, read or paraphrase

the following.

Set into the face of the sandstone cliffside is a

thick, wooden door. Just in front of it runs a

narrow  ledge  overlooking  the  perilous  drop

below.

The door is locked but not barred.

s Strong Wooden Door: 2 in. thick, hardness 5,

hp 20, break DC 23, Open Lock DC 30.

3

4

Creatures: A patrol of six Black Thorne mercenar-

ies  (four  fighters  and  two  sorcerers)  guards  the

entrance.

Black Thorne Fighter (4): hp 53 each; see

Appendix for statistics.

Black Thorne Sorcerer (2): hp 23 each; see

Appendix for statistics.

Tactics: Because of their recent raids, the merce-

naries are wary of intruders, and their guards are espe-

cially alert. This vigilance manifests as a +2 circum-

stance bonus on each mercenarys Spot checks when

the PCs approach. If they spot the PCs before they can

close to melee range, the Black Thorne mercenaries

attempt to hide in one of several nooks beside the door,

on side farthest from PCs. This tactic grants each a +2

circumstance bonus on his untrained Hide check.

The mercenaries attack as soon as any PC comes

within 25 feet of the door. If the PCs approach by

climbing the cliff face, the mercenaries fire arrows at

them until someone gets close enough for melee. If the

characters approach via the ledge, the mercenaries bull

rush them and attempt to push them off the cliff. Any

character forced off the ledge falls 50 feet, taking 5d6

points of damage.

When melee combat begins, the fighters quickly

form a line in front of the PCs to protect the sorcerers

in the back. If the PCs protect a spellcaster behind their

own lines but are within 15 feet of the fighters, the

latter use Spring Attack to attack the spellcaster, then

return to their starting squares.

Development: The six guards fight to the death.

They have made a pledge to Narulin to protect the

stronghold, and they fear the mind flayers more than

they fear death. If the battle goes poorly for them, they

focus on trying to force the PCs off the edge of the cliff.

These mercenaries have no keys for the locked door.

They expect their relief to open it for them at the end

of the watch.

A2. MAIN QUARTERS (EL 11)

The mercenaries spend most of their time in this cham-

ber. When the PCs enter, read or paraphrase the follow-

ing aloud.

This chamber has a lived-in look. The floor is cov-

ered by a clutter of personal belongings, bedrolls,

various items of clothing, and other odds and ends.

The two wooden tables that occupy the center of

the room are heaped with the bones of small ani-

mals. Against the north wall stand two empty 5-

foot-by-5-foot cells, each with an iron door.

Eight of the mercenaries are currently outside the com-

plex in search of targets for raiding. The rest of the

group, including Narulin, is aboard the nautiloid con-

cluding a deal for a group of prisoners.

Creatures: Currently, a group of five mercenaries

remains within the complex. At present, they are rest-

ing, but they will relieve the group on watch outside

within the hour.

Black Thorne Fighter (4): hp 53 each; see

Appendix for statistics.

Black Thorne Sorcerer: hp 23 each; see Appen-

dix for statistics.

Tactics: The Black Thorne fighters immediately

rush to attack when the PCs approach the room. If they

spot the characters in the hallway, they stand three

abreast in front of the entrance to block it and try to

inflict as much damage as possible. If the PCs manage

to get into the room, the fighters form a defensive line

to shield the sorcerer, who casts spells at the intruders

from his position of safety.

Treasure: Within this room are two locked chests

containing the mercenaries pay. Between them, they

hold 847 gp, an emerald (worth 300 gp), and four

potions of cure moderate wounds.

s Wooden Chests (2): Hardness 5, hp 25, break

DC 30, Open Lock DC 30.

Development: If the PCs kill or disable two of

the mercenary fighters, one of the remaining pair

attempts to flee to area A3 and rouse the kigrids, which

then chase him back into this room. At that point, the

creatures readily engage any PCs who are still standing.

A3. LAIR OF THE KIGRIDS (EL 11)

Read or paraphrase the following aloud when the PCs

enter this area, adjusting the text as needed if the

kigrids have already fought the PCs in area A2.

Bones, fur, and other grotesque remains of once-

living creatures litter the floor of this cavern. The

stench of rotten meat lingers in the air.

Eight feral-looking creatures with stone-gray

fur look up from a bloody meal. Each of these

vaguely feline quadrupeds has muscular legs, a

thick neck, and a flat, broad head. The creatures

eyes glow a dull red color, and their jaws are lined

with small, sharp teeth.

Creatures: This room is the lair of the kigridshor-

rific creatures from the illithidae family of monsters.

Xhuxuto gave them to the mercenaries as a gift to seal

their pact, and Narulin placed them here to protect the

5

route leading to the portal in area A4. Although kigrids

are natural hunters, the mercenaries keep them inside,

feeding them meat from any animals they hunt as well

as the corpses of any humanoids killed during their

raids.

Kigrids (8): hp 61, 62, 64, 66, 66, 70, 72, 73; see

Lords of Madness, page 155.

Tactics: The kigrids attack any creature that enters

the roomincluding the mercenariesthat does not

have a mind flayer escort. They immediately close to

melee, using their rake attacks to deliver poison. The

creatures use their numbers to advantage by attempt-

ing to flank the intruders whenever possible. If they

outnumber the PCs at least two to one, a few of the

kigrids attempt to grapple the groups primary melee

combatants so that the others can swarm any PCs who

are trying to stay out of combat and cast spells.

Development: The kigrids are fierce creatures,

but they are not stupid, and they value their continued

survival. If the PCs eliminate half the kigrids, those

remaining attempt to surrender to the party. If their

surrender is not accepted, they flee the stronghold.

If the kigrids are winning the fight and their oppo-

nents attempt to flee, the creatures pursue them any-

where within the complex. The mercenaries in area A2

may use this fact to their advantage by luring the

kigrids there to fight the PCs (see the Development

section in area A2).

A4. PORTAL ROOM

The portal that connects this complex with the nau-

tiloid is the sole feature of this chamber. Read or para-

phrase the following when the PCs enter.

A 6-foot tall object resembling an ornate mirror

dominates this chamber. Its reflective surface

emits a slowly pulsing red light.

This object is the portal to the nautiloid. As soon as

anyone steps into the square adjacent to the portal, the

light becomes a brilliant ruby red, and a room becomes

visible beyond the surface. Anyone who steps through

the surface is instantly transported to area 2 on the

bridge deck of the nautiloid (see Nautiloid Map).

B. NAUTILOID

SPELLJAMMER SHIP

Xhuxutos nautiloid is one of many ships that the mind

flayers brought back in time with them when they

escaped their races grim future. Each nautiloid is con-

structed from the shell of a massive snail harvested

from a world as yet unknown. Xhuxutos nautiloid is

currently 12 hours away from the illithid settlement

called Qmarr, which is headed by an ancient and pow-

erful elder brain.

6

NAUTILOID FEATURES

This particular nautiloid measures more than 100 feet in

length. The bottom is shaped much like that of a stan-

dard oceangoing vessel and is covered by a black, chiti-

nous substance. The upper portion consists primarily of

the massive snail shell. Two massive red eyes are set in

the top front portion of the ship, and large intertwining

tentacles protrude from the area just below them.

The ship has six decks, each of which is divided into

numerous rooms, as shown on the map. All these

rooms are currently empty except as described below.

Floors

The floor of each deck is a 3-inch-thick sheet of solid

crystal. The walls are equivalent to regular stone dun-

geon walls.

s Crystalline Floor: 3 in. thick, hardness 10, hp

600, break DC 25.

Crew

Because this region of space currently has very few

inhabitants other than the mind flayer colonies, the

nautiloid carries only a skeleton crew.

Power

A series spelljamming helm provides propulsion for

the nautiloid. This device also forms an air envelope

around the ship that extends to a distance of 20 feet

from the outer hull at all points.

In addition, the helm creates a gravity plane that

runs along the bottom of the ship. Any character or

object that drops over the edge of the nautiloid falls

until it crosses the gravity plane, then continues an

equal distance on the opposite side. The following

round, the object repeats the process in the reverse

direction, this time stopping 10 feet short of the posi-

tion from which it originally fell. This process contin-

ues until the object finally stops at the gravity plane.

If the helm is destroyed, all creatures aboard the

ship move at one-half their normal speed. The air enve-

lope dissipates in 3d10 rounds, after which each crea-

ture still aboard the ship takes 1d12 points of damage

per round until it either dies or finds a way off the ship.

B1. COMMAND STATION

When the nautiloid was fully staffed, the captain would

sit here to oversee ships operations. This vantage point

offers an excellent view of both the scout deck and the

bridge deck. Since he runs with only a skeleton crew,

however, Xhuxuto prefers a more hands-on approach

to command. All the chambers are empty except for a

few oddly shaped pieces of furniture.

B2. SCOUT DECK (EL 13)

The front of the scout deck consists of two rooms, one

in the stern and one in the fore.

B2a. Fore Chamber

Two open eyes look out into space from the forward

wall of this chamber. When the ship was fully staffed,

at least one mind flayer was always stationed here to

watch for potential hazards. Presently, however, the

chamber is unoccupied.

B2b. Stern Chamber

The series spelljamming helm is housed in this cham-

ber. Central to this device are five iron chairs, all linked

together, which siphon the psionic energy from the

mind flayers seated in them. This energy provides

propulsion for the ship and powers its navigational

system. Read or paraphrase the following when the

PCs enter this area.

On a dais stand five linked iron chairs, each con-

taining a seated mind flayer wearing an odd steel

helmet.  The  helmets  are  wired  together  and

attached to a large device that stands behind the

chairs. Energy visibly coruscates along the wires,

and the air around them crackles with power.

The helm is the source of the ships power. Without

this device and the mind flayers that provide energy for

it, the nautiloid is dead in space (see Power, above).

Creatures: All five of the illithids whose minds

are currently powering the ship are attached to the

helm when the PCs arrive.

Mind Flayers (5): hp 44, 46, 47, 48, 55; see Mon-

ster Manual, page 186.

Tactics: Unless the mind flayers are prepared for

the arrival of the PCs, it takes them a full round to extri-

cate themselves from their chairs. Once they have done

so, they attack immediately.

The illithids begin by trying to incapacitate as many

PCs as possible with their mind blasts. If this technique

proves ineffective, they use their spells, employing the

most powerful effects in their magical arsenals first in

hopes of gaining the upper hand. Should the PCs close

with them, the illithids use their improved grab and

extract attacks to feast on the brains of their opponents,

beginning with spellcasters if possible.

Development: If the PCs gain the upper hand in

the battle, the mind flayers attempt to surrender. If the

PCs refuse to accept, the illithids flee to the bridge

deck below.

8

The series helm is a powerful but unique magic

item, though it is not an artifact. It is vulnerable to reg-

ular damage just like any other object. If the series

helm is destroyed, the ship immediately loses gravity,

and the air envelope dissipates in 3d10 rounds (see

Power, above).

s Series Spelljamming Helm: Hardness 10,

hp 300, break DC 25.

B3. BRIDGE DECK (EL 12)

The portal from the Black Thorne Companys hideout

connects with area 2 of this deck, so it is here that the

PCs enter the ship. All other rooms on this deck are

empty.

When the PCs emerge from the portal, read or para-

phrase the following aloud.

A wall sections off the far side of this oval-shaped

room. This wall and the others are made of an

unknown, shiny brown material, and both the

floor and ceiling seem to be made of flat, opaque

crystal. To either side of the chamber is a balcony

that gives a fine view of the starry night beyond.

This chamber was, and still is, the main floor of the

bridge, from which the mind flayers operate the ships

navigational system.

Creatures: Three Black Thorne fighters and one

Black Thorne sorcerer guard this room while their

leader is conferring with Xhuxuto.

Black Thorne Fighter (3): hp 53 each; see

Appendix for statistics.

Black Thorne Sorcerer: hp 23; see Appendix for

statistics.

Tactics: Since the portal emits a bright red light

when operating, the PCs have no chance to surprise the

mercenary guards. They attack as soon as the PCs

arrive, and each gains a +5 circumstance bonus on her

initiative roll. The fighters stand back from the portal

and fire arrows at the party, then switch to their swords

as soon as the PCs close for melee. The sorcerer takes a

position behind the fighters and casts spells.

Development: If the battle goes poorly for the

mercenaries, they flee to the scout deck and combine

forces with the mind flayers in the series helm.

B4. BATTLE DECK (EL 14)

All the rooms on this deck are empty except for room 1

(encounter B4a) and room 6 (encounter B4b). The most

likely entry point to this deck is via the stairs.

B4a. Treasure Chamber (Room 1)

The mind flayers have been hoarding their gold in this

room. Within it is a locked chest containing 14,563 gp.

s Treasure Chest: Hardness 5, hp 25, break DC

30, Open Lock DC 30.

B4b. Battle Station (Room 6)

Read or paraphrase the following aloud when the PCs

enter room 6 of the battle deck.

A large, square hole in the deck floor marks the

approximate center of this chamber. Beyond it

stands a device of unknown purpose. At the far

side of the deck, stairs lead up to a platform where

a large ballista is mounted.

Four figurestwo humans and two illithids

are standing in front of the device talking. One

mind flayer appears to be more physically power-

ful than the other, with muscles rippling beneath

its slick-looking skin. It wears a chain shirt and

holds a green sword that appears to be composed

of pure energy. Beside this creature stands a tall,

powerfully built human male sporting numerous

facial scars. He wears plate mail and carries a

glowing greatsword. The other two figures are

both robed. The mind flayer wears flowing green

robes on its typically gaunt frame, and the human

wears black robes and carries a morningstar.

The hole is approximately 20 feet square and leads to

the slave deck, to which a load of prisoners has just

been delivered. The device beyond the hole is a battle

station from which the ships weapon systems can be

operated.

Creatures: The mind flayer leader Xhuuto, the

mercenary leader Narulin, a second mind flayer, and a

Black Thorne Mercenary are discussing the price of the

current batch of prisoners that the mercenaries have

brought.

Xhuxuto: hp 94; see Appendix for statistics.

Narulin: hp 75; see Appendix for statistics.

Black Thorne Sorcerer: hp 23; see Appendix for

statistics.

Mind Flayer: hp 46; see Monster Manual, page 186.

Development: If Xhuxuto dies, the ship is lead-

erless, but it can still function as long as at least five

mind  flayers  remain  alive  to  power  the  helm.  If

Narulin dies, any Black Thorne mercenary still alive

immediately  assumes  command  of  the  group  and

orders the survivors back to the stronghold.

B5. CARGO DECK

The cargo deck is currently empty. Near the fore, in

room 1, two massive ruby eyes are set into the wall.

Any character looking through them gains darkvision

with a range of 250 feet as long as he continues to use

them.

B6. SLAVE DECK (EL 11)

This deck is empty except for rooms 7, 8, and 9, where

the humanoid prisoners destined for the asteroid

colonies are held.

When the PCs enter this area, read or paraphrase

the following aloud.

Whatever its original purpose, this deck is now

clearly being used to house prisoners. The walls

are lined with small 5-foot-by-5-foot cells, each

apparently occupied by one or two humanoids.

Three mercenaries guard the chamber, taunting

the prisoners with comments about the fate that

awaits them.

The cargo currently consists of seventeen prisoners,

including Garris, the nephew of Lord Dannis (see

Adventure Hooks). Eight of the nine cells contain two

prisoners each, and the ninth cell contains only Garris.

Creatures: Three Black Thorn fighters guard the

room.

Black Thorne Fighter (3): hp 53 each; see

Appendix for statistics.

Tactics: Since they lack any sort of magical sup-

port, these mercenaries stand toe-to-toe with the PCs

and focus their attacks on the strongest fighters. They

immediately surrender if two of them are reduced to

fewer than half their original hit points, or if the PCs

produce the keys to the cells, since possession of the

keys means they have already slain both Xhuxuto and

Narulin. If the PCs continue to attack, the mercenaries

fight to defend themselves.

Development: Once they have defeated the mer-

cenaries, the PCs can rescue the prisoners from the

cells.

s Cell Lock: Hardness 15, hp 30, Open Lock DC

30. The locks can be opened with Narulins keys.

CONCLUDING THE

ADVENTURE

The nautiloid ships are among the illithids most valu-

able possessions, since they cannot be recreated in this

time period. If the PCs manage to clear the ship of foes

but leave it intact, mind flayers from one of the asteroid

colonies eventually try to reclaim it and put it back into

service as a slave ship. PCs who dont want it used for

such  an  evil  purpose  can  eliminate  the  threat  by

destroying the series helm that powers it.

If the PCs rescue the prisoners held on the slave

deck and return them safely to their families, they

receive 500 gp as a reward, in addition to any other

rewards they were offered for this service.

FURTHER ADVENTURES

If the PCs decide to let the mind flayers operating the

series helm live after dispatching the illithid and

human leaders, the ship continues onward to the city

of Qmarr. Should the characters choose to remain

aboard the ship and attempt to fight the entire mind

flayer community, they will soon find themselves over-

whelmed. The elder brain easily senses their presence

and coordinates the citys mind flayer inhabitants to

end the threat. PCs who choose this option will be

attacked mercilessly until they either flee the city or

perish.

Extract (Ex): If Xhuxuto begins its turn with all

four tentacles attached and makes a successful grapple

check, it automatically extracts the opponents brain,

10

instantly  killing  it.  This  power  is  useless  against

constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. It is

not instantly fatal to foes with multiple heads, such as

ettins and hydras.

Improved  Grab  (Ex): To  use  this  ability,

Xhuxuto must hit a Small, Medium, or Large creature

with its tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a hold and attaches the tentacle to the opponents head.

Xhuxuto can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only if

it  can  somehow  reach  the  foes  head.  If  Xhuxuto

begins its turn with at least one tentacle attached, it can

try to attach its remaining tentacles with a single grap-

ple check. The opponent can escape with a single suc-

cessful grapple or Escape Artist check, but Xhuxuto

gets a +2 circumstance bonus for every tentacle that

was attached at the beginning of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): This psionic attack is a cone 60

feet long. Anyone caught in this cone must succeed on

a  DC  15  Will  save  or  be  stunned  for  3d4  rounds.

Xhuxuto often hunts using this power and then drags

off one or two of its stunned victims to feed upon. This

ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Psionics (Sp): At willcharm monster (DC 16),

detect thoughts (DC 14), levitate, plane shift, suggestion (DC
