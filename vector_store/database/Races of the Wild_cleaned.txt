Introduction

Races of the Wild is a rules supplement for the DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS roleplaying game. It is primarily a player resource

focusing on new options and expanded rules for D&D players

whose characters are elves or halings, as well as players inter-

ested in new races such as the winged raptorans. Dungeon

Masters can use this book as a resource for adventures that

take place in elf tree-cities, among haling caravans, or in

the cliff-side dwellings of the raptorans.

WHAT IS A

RACE OF THE WILD?

The wilderness regions of most D&D worlds are inhabited

not only by wild animals and rampaging monsters but also by

a potentially bewildering variety of sentient races. This book

focuses on three of those races: the elves of the great forests,

who build their civilizations in harmony with the natural

rhythms  of  the  wilderness;  the  halings,  whose  nomadic

lifestyles carry them across the wild lands; and the raptorans,

who inhabit cliff-side dwellings far from civilized lands.

While its primary emphasis lies on these three races, the

book also discusses other races that dwell in the wilds. These

include fey (killoren), wild humanoids (catfolk and gnolls),

and  monstrous  humanoids  (centaurs).  Animals  that  serve

as traditional companions to these wild races also appear in

this book.

WHATS IN THIS BOOK

Look  beyond  the  walls  of  the  great  human  cities  we  call

home.  What  do  you  see?  A  vast  wilderness  stretches  out

to meet the horizon, and within its trackless depths elves

hone their ancient magic, halings revel in the discovery

of what lies beyond the next hill, and raptorans forge pacts

with  air  elementals  to  reach  the  sky.  Grab  your  tent  and

bedrollits  time  to  meet  the  people  who  call  this  great

wilderness their home.

Races  of  the  Wild  opens  with  a  deep  look  at  the  culture,

traditions, and beliefs of elves, the race in the Players Handbook

that seems to inspire the most fascination. Creative, contem-

plative, aloof, and strong-minded, elves display a predilection

for arcane magic that surpasses all of the common races, yet

they also make erce warriors. Players of elf characters will

nd abundant roleplaying suggestions, from common sayings

and proverbs to inspirational elven legends.

Whereas elves tend to settle in their ancient forests, half-

lings often live on the road. The wilderness, after all, is their

playground.  Pragmatic,  winsome,  curious,  and  adaptable,

halings are arguably the most free-spirited of the common

races, slow to anger yet canny in their dealings. To them, home

is wherever they happen to be. What is it like to belong to

such a nomadic culture? Races of the Wild helps players with

haling characters explore the nuances of haling society

and understand their unique views on gypsy life and their

approach to religion and worship.

Perhaps the most mysterious of the wild races, raptorans

are  avian  humanoids  known  for  their  wisdom,  devotion,

caution, and ferocity in battle. They value freedom, follow

the teachings of their beloved gods, and honor ancient pacts

with elemental lords who grant them the power of ight.

Races  of  the  Wild  offers  our  rst  glimpse  of  this  new  race,

revealing  all  the  information  a  player  needs  to  generate  a

raptoran character and play a member of their unique and

complex culture at the gaming table.

Races of the Wild touches briey on several other races

common  to  the  wilderness,  including  centaurs  and

gnolls.  It  reintroduces  the  catfolk,  who  rst  appeared

in the Miniatures Handbook, and sheds some light on the

killorenan all-new fey race, living embodiments of the

spirit of the wild. Each race in this chapter includes full

game  statistics  with  an  emphasis  on  player  characters,

including  monster  classes  and  level  adjustments  for  the

more powerful races.

Races of the Wild also includes new options for characters

whose heritage lies in the wild places of the world. New feats

and prestige classes can enhance a current character or help

inspire a concept for a new character. The cultural informa-

tion  presented  about  each  race  is  designed  to  stimulate

roleplaying at the table. It can also help a Dungeon Master

design interesting encounters, adventures, and whole cam-

paigns among the races of the wild. The book closes with

advice for the DM on how to assemble an adventuring group

from the various races of the wild and create adventures in

or near the places that they call home.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Races of the Wild makes use of the information in all three

D&D core rulebooksthe Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters

Guide, and Monster Manual. However, players creating char-

acters using the options presented in this book can get by

with just the Players Handbook.

Races of the Wild periodically refers to other D&D supple-

ments, including Races of Stone, Complete Warrior, Complete

Arcane, Complete Adventurer, Fiend Folio, and Miniatures Hand-

book. These references are not required to use this book, and

readers should treat them as optional.

mong  the  races  of  the  wild  in  the  DUNGEONS  &

DRAGONS game, the most widely known is the elf.

Elegant, slim, and lithe, elves are beings of unearthly

beauty who are almost universally committed to

life in harmony with nature. Few outsiders can

appreciate the depth and richness of a culture thousands of

years older than their own or the complexity of people who

live for hundreds upon hundreds of years.

Though elves are highly independent creatures who value

individual achievement, their cities are the very pinnacle of

civilization. This chapter provides a window into the elven

world and offers a framework upon which players and DMs

may expand for their own campaigns.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

As the rosy glow of the dawn illuminated his bedchamber,

Tharivol Siannodel roused slowly from his trance. Smiling

as  the  morning  sunshine  bathed  his  face,  he  recalled  his

musings during his reverie. He had been meditating on

his childhood, remembering a game he once played with

his younger sister in which the two of them hid starowers

around their village and watched to see who found them.

Drusilia Amakiir, the villages Guardian of Nature, found

so many of the owers that she made a chain of them and

presented it to the two children. They never did gure out

how  she  found  so  many  owers;  they  thought  they  had

been very careful in hiding them.

Tharivol stretched languorously, rolled out of bed, and

reached for his clothes. His great-aunt, Caewenan Meli-

Introduction

Races of the Wild is a rules supplement for the DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS roleplaying game. It is primarily a player resource

focusing on new options and expanded rules for D&D players

whose characters are elves or halings, as well as players inter-

ested in new races such as the winged raptorans. Dungeon

Masters can use this book as a resource for adventures that

take place in elf tree-cities, among haling caravans, or in

the cliff-side dwellings of the raptorans.

WHAT IS A

RACE OF THE WILD?

The wilderness regions of most D&D worlds are inhabited

not only by wild animals and rampaging monsters but also by

a potentially bewildering variety of sentient races. This book

focuses on three of those races: the elves of the great forests,

who build their civilizations in harmony with the natural

rhythms  of  the  wilderness;  the  halings,  whose  nomadic

lifestyles carry them across the wild lands; and the raptorans,

who inhabit cliff-side dwellings far from civilized lands.

While its primary emphasis lies on these three races, the

book also discusses other races that dwell in the wilds. These

include fey (killoren), wild humanoids (catfolk and gnolls),

and  monstrous  humanoids  (centaurs).  Animals  that  serve

as traditional companions to these wild races also appear in

this book.

WHATS IN THIS BOOK

Look  beyond  the  walls  of  the  great  human  cities  we  call

home.  What  do  you  see?  A  vast  wilderness  stretches  out

to meet the horizon, and within its trackless depths elves

hone their ancient magic, halings revel in the discovery

of what lies beyond the next hill, and raptorans forge pacts

with  air  elementals  to  reach  the  sky.  Grab  your  tent  and

bedrollits  time  to  meet  the  people  who  call  this  great

wilderness their home.

Races  of  the  Wild  opens  with  a  deep  look  at  the  culture,

traditions, and beliefs of elves, the race in the Players Handbook

that seems to inspire the most fascination. Creative, contem-

plative, aloof, and strong-minded, elves display a predilection

for arcane magic that surpasses all of the common races, yet

they also make erce warriors. Players of elf characters will

nd abundant roleplaying suggestions, from common sayings

and proverbs to inspirational elven legends.

Whereas elves tend to settle in their ancient forests, half-

lings often live on the road. The wilderness, after all, is their

playground.  Pragmatic,  winsome,  curious,  and  adaptable,

halings are arguably the most free-spirited of the common

races, slow to anger yet canny in their dealings. To them, home

is wherever they happen to be. What is it like to belong to

such a nomadic culture? Races of the Wild helps players with

haling characters explore the nuances of haling society

and understand their unique views on gypsy life and their

approach to religion and worship.

Perhaps the most mysterious of the wild races, raptorans

are  avian  humanoids  known  for  their  wisdom,  devotion,

caution, and ferocity in battle. They value freedom, follow

the teachings of their beloved gods, and honor ancient pacts

with elemental lords who grant them the power of ight.

Races  of  the  Wild  offers  our  rst  glimpse  of  this  new  race,

revealing  all  the  information  a  player  needs  to  generate  a

raptoran character and play a member of their unique and

complex culture at the gaming table.

Races of the Wild touches briey on several other races

common  to  the  wilderness,  including  centaurs  and

gnolls.  It  reintroduces  the  catfolk,  who  rst  appeared

in the Miniatures Handbook, and sheds some light on the

killorenan all-new fey race, living embodiments of the

spirit of the wild. Each race in this chapter includes full

game  statistics  with  an  emphasis  on  player  characters,

including  monster  classes  and  level  adjustments  for  the

more powerful races.

Races of the Wild also includes new options for characters

whose heritage lies in the wild places of the world. New feats

and prestige classes can enhance a current character or help

inspire a concept for a new character. The cultural informa-

tion  presented  about  each  race  is  designed  to  stimulate

roleplaying at the table. It can also help a Dungeon Master

design interesting encounters, adventures, and whole cam-

paigns among the races of the wild. The book closes with

advice for the DM on how to assemble an adventuring group

from the various races of the wild and create adventures in

or near the places that they call home.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Races of the Wild makes use of the information in all three

D&D core rulebooksthe Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters

Guide, and Monster Manual. However, players creating char-

acters using the options presented in this book can get by

with just the Players Handbook.

Races of the Wild periodically refers to other D&D supple-

ments, including Races of Stone, Complete Warrior, Complete

Arcane, Complete Adventurer, Fiend Folio, and Miniatures Hand-

book. These references are not required to use this book, and

readers should treat them as optional.

mong  the  races  of  the  wild  in  the  DUNGEONS  &

DRAGONS game, the most widely known is the elf.

Elegant, slim, and lithe, elves are beings of unearthly

beauty who are almost universally committed to

life in harmony with nature. Few outsiders can

appreciate the depth and richness of a culture thousands of

years older than their own or the complexity of people who

live for hundreds upon hundreds of years.

Though elves are highly independent creatures who value

individual achievement, their cities are the very pinnacle of

civilization. This chapter provides a window into the elven

world and offers a framework upon which players and DMs

may expand for their own campaigns.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

As the rosy glow of the dawn illuminated his bedchamber,

Tharivol Siannodel roused slowly from his trance. Smiling

as  the  morning  sunshine  bathed  his  face,  he  recalled  his

musings during his reverie. He had been meditating on

his childhood, remembering a game he once played with

his younger sister in which the two of them hid starowers

around their village and watched to see who found them.

Drusilia Amakiir, the villages Guardian of Nature, found

so many of the owers that she made a chain of them and

presented it to the two children. They never did gure out

how  she  found  so  many  owers;  they  thought  they  had

been very careful in hiding them.

Tharivol stretched languorously, rolled out of bed, and

reached for his clothes. His great-aunt, Caewenan Meli-

amne, her consort, and his cousins would soon be awake,

and he wanted to surprise them with breakfast. After

dressing quickly in his tunic and trousers, he threw on

his blue cloak and slipped silently from his room in the

familys tree house. Dropping soundlessly to the lower

platform, he opened the door and breathed in the fresh

air of the morning. Ah, the scent of lilies on the airhis

great-aunt grew the nest lilies in the realm! Across the

rope-and-plank bridge he moved, past his neighbors

house, waving cheerily to his friend Jyllia, who was

peering from her window. Quickly descending the

ladder by their tree, he dropped to the ground and

headed for the orchards.

The  fruit  trees  in  the  community  orchard  were

not separated by kind. Instead, as was the elven way,

they were interspersed with one another and with

hardwood trees in a semblance of natures random-

ness. Stopping only to greet the villages Guardian of

Nature, Tharivol headed into the orchard to pick fruits

for breakfast. Apples, pears, pomegranates, and plums

went into his bag, followed by brambleberries from the

vines that climbed the older trees. On his way home, he  5

gathered a bit of grain and a few sweet herbs from the family

garden plot. Throwing the sack over his shoulder, he nimbly

climbed up the ladder and made his way back home.

In the kitchen, he ground the grain and chopped the fruit,

then added water and the sweet herbs to make a thin batter.

He dropped portions of the mixture onto a hot griddle, and

soon had morning cakes piled on a plate and ready to eat.

Mmmm, breakfast! said Tharivols cousin Heiven, rub-

bing his hands as he came into the room. Soon the whole

family was gathered around the table.

Your skill with cooking is improving, said his great-aunt

as she helped him clear the table. As is your aptitude with the

bow. I was watching you on the practice range yesterday.

Warmed by Caewenans praise, Tharivol grabbed the long-

bow and longsword that Caewenans consort had lent him

and headed off to weapons practice.

Jyllia and her cousin Quarion joined him, and the three

friends  arrived  at  the  archery  range  together.  Todays

lesson would be hardhitting a disk thrown into the air

by the instructor.

You must rst see your target, said the young cleric of

Vandria Gilmadrith gently. Do not re blindly unless you can

pinpoint the location of the disk some other way. Ammunition

is too precious to waste in wartime. Still, Tharivol grinned

and closed his eyes the next time the disk rose into the air.

Listening intently, he tracked the motion of the target by the

sound it made as it spun through the air. Releasing the taut

bowstring at just the right moment, he heard the satisfying

sound of the disk shattering.

I am impressed, said the Master of Arms, who had been

watching the exercise. Not all have honed their hearing to

such an extent. I believe its time you served in the watch.

Tharivol was delighted, and he promised to report the next

morning for assignment.

The watch! exclaimed Jyllia. I wish I could join. The

three nished their target practice and headed for the armory

to practice with their swords. After warming up, they paired

off for sparring. Jyllia excelled in close combat, and she bested

Tharivol in three out of four practice bouts. The instructor

shook his head, adjusted Tharivols stance, and checked the

balance of his weapon. It was no use; Jyllia continued to shine,

and Tharivol drew extra practices.

Jyllia and Quarion waited for Tharivol to nish; then the

three wandered off to nd some lunch. Munching on berries

from  the  bushes  around  the  settlement,  fresh  peas  from

Jyllias garden, and some bread that Caewenan had baked the

previous day, they chatted about their other projects. Jyllia

was studying jewelry making with Quarions grandfather,

and she was nearly nished making a silver bracelet set with

aventurine. Quarion intended to build his own house as soon

as he came of age, so he was studying architecture under the

Master Builder. As for Tharivol, he was studying magic with

his great-aunt. So far, he had mastered several cantrips, and

he was well on his way to learning real magic.

After the three nished eating, Jyllia begged Tharivol for

a magic show, and he complied with a bit of prestidigitation

that drew a small crowd of their friends. Some of them pitched

in with their own tricks, and the spontaneous show soon

attracted quite a few adults, some of whom produced a few

illusions to liven up the party.

After the magic show broke up, the three friends went their

separate ways. Tharivol found his great-aunt in her laboratory

writing scrolls. Taking pen and parchment, Tharivol worked

at scribing some of his cantrips onto scrolls. After an hour

of this activity, Caewenan began teaching him the words to

a sleep spell. Reach out with your mind for the power, she

said, encouraging him as he tried to learn the arcane words

from her book.

Tharivol tried, and he could feel an energy somewhere

out there, an energy that was almost palpable, but which

somehow eluded his grasp. The words didnt seem to go with

the motions; and when should he toss the sand? Again he

tried, and again. Just as he was about to give up, it happened!

Understanding ooded his mind as he seized the energy of

the spell and wrapped his mind around it. Searching about

for a target, he spied the caged songbird his aunt kept in the

laboratory, spoke the spell, and the creature promptly stuck

its head under its wing and went to sleep.

Bursting with pride, Tharivol wrote the spell in his spell-

book and put it away for tomorrow. He couldnt wait to show

Jyllia what he could do!

Now, however, evening was fast approaching, and  a dance

was scheduled in the common area under the full moon.

Wylmara would be there . . . and maybe this time she would

dance with him.

Tharivol went downstairs and helped himself to several

slices of the roasted pheasant his cousin had prepared, lling

the rest of his plate with fresh vegetables picked from the

familys garden. For dessert, he made himself a fruit pudding

with the rest of the berries he had picked at lunchtime. Then

he retired to his room to paint.

Tharivol had learned to paint at his grandfathers house,

where he had last fostered, and he found it a pleasant and

relaxing activity. A sense of pleasure lled him as he picked

up his brush and applied himself to the landscape he was

working ona view of the setting sun across the meadow

outside the village. He could see the scene from his own

window, and tonight the sky seemed lled with unusually

brilliant shades of orange, pink, and mauve.

When he heard the musicians tuning up outside, he hur-

riedly changed into his leather breeches and embroidered

shirt and headed outside for the dance. Wylmara was already

there, and she accepted his invitation to dance. After one

dance, she swirled away into a dance of her own, and even

the elders were applauding when it was over. Then Tharivol

danced with Jyllia, and later joined a complex line dance with

the other young men. On into the night the elves danced,

until the full moon hung high in the sky overhead.

At last, the dancers began to slip away to their homes, one

by one. Tired but satised, Tharivol went up to his own room

and lay down to rest. He knew what he wanted to remember

tonightthe thrill of memorizing his rst real spell. Still,

no elf could predict which memory would surface during

his trance, so Tharivol savored his day for a moment before

beginning his meditation.

DESCRIPTION

Elves are short and willowy in comparison to humans. Their

height ranges from 4-1/2 feet to 5-1/2 feet, and they generally

weigh between 95 and 135 pounds. Males and females are

usually equal in height, though the males tend to be slightly

more muscular. Elves lithe bodies are perfectly proportioned,

and  their  movements  are  almost  supernaturally  graceful.

Most high elves have pale skin and dark hair, though lighter

shades of hair are known in many societies. Neither gender

sports any facial hair, and elves features are well dened

and elegant, though somewhat more angular than those of

humans. Their almond-shaped eyes are usually green, though

they can also be blue, gold, silver, or lavender. Their ears

sweep upward to pointed endsa factor that many claim

contributes to their acute hearing.

CLOTHING

Elves dress in simple, comfortable clothing, though their garb

always has an elegance in keeping with their graceful bearing.

Linen, silk, cotton, and wool are common fabrics for elven

clothing, and elves have developed the skill to spin even the

coarsest of natural bers into incredibly ne thread that can

be tightly woven to create soft cloth of surprising strength.

Leathers and furs are regularly used to endow clothing with

strength and protection. Leather is always tanned to a ne,

supple texture. Fur provides both warmth and elegance, and

the elves incorporate it often into their garb. Soft furs such

as rabbit and lynx are preferred over bear and other rough-

textured furs. Spider silk, certain mosses, and the bers of

ower stalks are also spun into cloth. Thistledown treated

with magic is the material of choice for elven cloaks, though

the creation of this cloth is a lengthy process. Occasionally

different bers are woven together to create tactile interest

or to combine the characteristics of different materials for

practical reasons. Elves make all their own cloth, seeing the

textiles of other races as inferior in quality and workmanship.

They  occasionally  trade  with  human  settlements  for  raw

materials, but rarely for nished cloth.

Colors and styles of clothing vary with individual taste.

Many elves prefer muted tones that help them to blend in with

the surrounding forest; others enjoy wearing bright colors

ranging in shade from pastels to jewel tones. Dyes are drawn

from a variety of natural sources, most of them plant-based.

Multihued garments are also reasonably common, though

the patterns of those colors are rarely geometric. Elves prefer

irregular swatches of coloration that imitate the sun-dappled

forest oor or wind-tossed clouds in a stormy sky.

Elves see adornment and elegance of style as marks of a

highly civilized society as well as declarations of individual-

ity. A tunic, cloak, or pair of trousers may be adorned with

embroidery, encrusted with tiny gems, or decorated with bits

of polished wood. Alternatively, an item of clothing may be

cut or pieced together in some dramatic way. Embroidery can

range from a border done in contrasting thread to a fantastic

design prominently displayed on a sleeve or bodice. Metallic

threads are sometimes employed for such embellishments

among wealthier elves, but the colors of nature (ranging from

muted earth tones to the bright colors of the sun, the sea, or

brilliant owers) are more commonly chosen as adornments.

Leather and fur may also be dyed, though such materials are

often left natural and adorned in other ways.

Fastenings made of metal are rare. Base metals are almost

never used in elven clothing, though precious metals may

serve as adornment. Usually, elven clothing is fastened with

hooks  or  buttons  made  of  polished  wood;  carved  bone  or

ivory fasteners and leather thongs are also common.

Footwear typically consists of boots made of supple leather

afxed to sturdy soles made of wood or hardened leather;

more  delicate  footgear  is  sometimes  used  for  ceremonial

purposes. Leather soles secured to the bottoms of the feet

with long leather thongs laced up the calf are often used as

light footgear for dancing and other pursuits requiring only

minimal protection. Shoes carved in fantastic designs from

crystal or other precious substances are occasionally used by

elf nobles during affairs of state.

All elven clothing, whether for important ceremonies or

daily wear, is styled for ease of use and movement. To an

elf, clothing that binds, restricts motion, fails to provide

adequate warmth or protection in the situation for which it

is intended, or in any way interferes with the business of life

is worse than useless. Quietness is also a key consideration,

so  elves  avoid  garb  that  makes  any  more  noise  than  the

rustling of leaves.

Almost all elves wear jewelry of some kind. The materials

may or may not be of exceptional value, but they are always

worked to enhance their beauty rather than left rustic and

natural. Circlets, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, armbands,

anklets, and rings are common. Designs are invariably light

and airy rather than ostentatious or bulky, and many reect

nature either directly or in some stylized way. Gold or silver

pendants shaped like owers or birds are common, as are

silver circlets whose lines are reminiscent of running water.

Gemstones are often incorporated into jewelry designs, usu-

ally in a manner that integrates them with the whole of the

piece. Huge, barely polished gemstones crudely plunked into

hammered gold settings are for humans and dwarves; elves

prefer lightness, delicacy, and artistry in their jewelry.

Typical garb for a member of either gender consists of a

tunic and trousers covered by a cloak. The tunic is usually

made  of  light,  tightly  woven  material  such  as  ne  linen,

cotton, or silk, and the trousers are often made of wool spun

ne  and  closely  woven.  Cloaks  are  made  of  sturdy  cloth

because they serve a variety of purposes. An elf may wear

one for warmth, wrap himself in it for resting, or spread it on

the ground to sit on. Cloaks for travel are usually dyed green,

brown, or some combination of those shades to blend in with

the forest, while cloaks worn by nobles within the safety of

afxed to sturdy soles made of wood or hardened leather;

more  delicate  footgear  is  sometimes  used  for  ceremonial

purposes. Leather soles secured to the bottoms of the feet

with long leather thongs laced up the calf are often used as

light footgear for dancing and other pursuits requiring only

minimal protection. Shoes carved in fantastic designs from

crystal or other precious substances are occasionally used by

elf nobles during affairs of state.

All elven clothing, whether for important ceremonies or

daily wear, is styled for ease of use and movement. To an

elf, clothing that binds, restricts motion, fails to provide

adequate warmth or protection in the situation for which it

is intended, or in any way interferes with the business of life

is worse than useless. Quietness is also a key consideration,

so  elves  avoid  garb  that  makes  any  more  noise  than  the

rustling of leaves.

Almost all elves wear jewelry of some kind. The materials

may or may not be of exceptional value, but they are always

worked to enhance their beauty rather than left rustic and

natural. Circlets, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, armbands,

anklets, and rings are common. Designs are invariably light

and airy rather than ostentatious or bulky, and many reect

nature either directly or in some stylized way. Gold or silver

pendants shaped like owers or birds are common, as are

silver circlets whose lines are reminiscent of running water.

Gemstones are often incorporated into jewelry designs, usu-

ally in a manner that integrates them with the whole of the

piece. Huge, barely polished gemstones crudely plunked into

hammered gold settings are for humans and dwarves; elves

prefer lightness, delicacy, and artistry in their jewelry.

Typical garb for a member of either gender consists of a

tunic and trousers covered by a cloak. The tunic is usually

made  of  light,  tightly  woven  material  such  as  ne  linen,

cotton, or silk, and the trousers are often made of wool spun

ne  and  closely  woven.  Cloaks  are  made  of  sturdy  cloth

because they serve a variety of purposes. An elf may wear

one for warmth, wrap himself in it for resting, or spread it on

the ground to sit on. Cloaks for travel are usually dyed green,

brown, or some combination of those shades to blend in with

the forest, while cloaks worn by nobles within the safety of

an elf city may brilliantly colored and elegantly decorated.

Cloaks  are  often  edged  in  fur  or  feathers,  and  elves  from

colder climes often wear cloaks made of one kind of fur and

lined with a softer variety.

Elegantly cut robes and gowns are favored by elves attend-

ing ceremonial functions and by wizards working within

their own homes. Such garb lends itself well to unusual styles

and colors as well as adornment. It is often cut to reveal chest,

legs, or midriff.

Elves clothe themselves appropriately for the climate, so

they rarely need to adopt the clothing of other races unless

they are visiting environments entirely foreign to them.

GROOMING

The much-vaunted elven individualism gives rise to a devo-

tion to personal grooming unequaled in most other races.

The elves strong respect for self engenders an inborn desire

to care for their own bodiesparticularly since their bodies

must last for hundreds of years.

Thus,  daily  grooming  has  been  raised  to  the  level  of  a

ritual in most elf communities. Elves bathe daily in natural

waterways such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. They may bathe

with  others  of  their  kind  or  alone,  according  to  personal

preference, and many often change their preferences based

on the circumstances and their mood. Joining another elf

in  bathing  without  permission  is  considered  particularly

rude.  No  societal  mores  forbid  bathing  with  the  opposite

sex, though doing so represents a degree of intimacy rarely

found outside the bounds of the family.

Elves make various kinds of soap from vegetable materials

that degrade naturally in the water. Thus, their penchant for

thorough cleaning causes no harm to the plants or animals

that live in the waterways in which they bathe.

Unlike most other races, elves also take exceptional care

of their teeth. Once or twice a day, elves chew green twigs,

forcing the frayed ends between their teeth to clean out bits

of food and shine their teeth. This level of care ensures that

elves generally lose teeth only to injury or accident.

Most elves wear their hair long and keep it brushed to a

sheen. Brushing such long, ne tresses takes considerable

time, but the elves do not regret this, treating the activity as

yet another daily ritual. The rhythm of the brushing move-

ment induces a state of calmness that many elves nd useful

for thinking through problems, and they enjoy the tactile

sensation. After it is brushed, the hair is styled in whatever

way appeals to the individual elf. Some, particularly ghters,

braid portions of their hair to keep it away from their faces.

Others pile it atop their heads, twine it with strings of pearls

or other gemstones, or artfully pin up portions of it with

jeweled hairclips.

The practice of tattooing is not unknown among elves, but

most nd such alteration too permanent for their tastes. An

adult elf who chooses to tattoo his skin is making a statement

about himself that will likely last for hundreds of years, so the

design chosen is always one that truly ts his personality and

tastes. On the other hand, painting the skin with henna and

other washable dyes is relatively common. Elves often create

elaborate and artistic designs on their skin for the sheer joy

of doing so, though some decorate themselves with designs

chosen for particular purposes, such as weddings, funerals,

adventures, or other life-altering events. Body piercings are

not as rare as tattoos; many elves enjoy creating new spaces

on their persons to display jewelry.

The tight weave of most elven clothing makes it resistant

to stains and dirt, so elves rarely appear soiled even after

having slept on the forest oor. Elves clothes often take

a long time to make and adorn, so they tend to treat them

with respect. They wash their clothes regularly in streams

or lakes and often treat them with a special substance made

from vegetable oil that prevents staining.

PSYCHOLOGY

More than any other single factor, an innate respect for

individualism governs an elfs behavior. Though elves do live

in communities, each elf strives for self-sufciency as well as

harmony with the land and his fellow creatures. This attitude

engenders an expectation that other beings are equally able to

care for themselves unless ill or injuredwhich sometimes

makes elves appear haughty, uncaring, and unhelpful to

humans, dwarves, and other less chaotic races. In truth, elves

are no less willing to help others in need than any other good-

aligned race, but their respect for the boundaries of others

often prevents them from offering aid to those who seem

more or less capable and have not requested help.

The strong sense of individualism that pervades the elven

nature also gives rise to a strong need for self-expression. Given

an elfs natural aptitude for the arts, such expression often

manifests itself in sculpture, painting, textile art, music, archi-

tecture, landscaping, gourmet cooking, storytelling, acting,

dance, or any of various kinds of crafts. It may also take the form

of pointed disagreements with authority gures and even an

occasional impassioned expression of opinion. The naturally

reserved dwarves often see such outbursts as an inability to

control ones emotions, but to an elf, failure to express opinions

represents a foolish abrogation of the self.

Elves  consider  the  free  expression  of  sorrow  or  joy  as

not only a personal right, but also a societal necessity. No

stigma is attached to an elf who laughs or cries in public, or

who makes others do so by means of story or song. The fact

that most elves are comfortable with expressing their own

emotions  makes  them  particularly  good  bards  and  actors.

Nevertheless,  many  elves  who  spend  time  with  members

of other races learn to curb their emotions in public, often

resorting to dry humor to mask profound feelings.

Personal privacy is a matter of utmost importance to an elf,

and the designation of personal space is a vital expression of

self. Elves are taught from birth to establish their own space

and respect that of others. Thus, approaching another elf too

closelyor, worse yet, touching onewithout invitation is

considered the height of rudeness. Since most elf communi-

ties are established in outdoor settings, space is rarely at a

1

premium. Thus, each individual can have at least a roomif

not an entire dwellingof his own. An elfs private chamber

is an extension of his own personal space and is considered

off-limits to others unless express permission is given to enter.

When a communitys size becomes unwieldy and threatens

the sustainability of the surrounding resources, a contingent

of young adults often splits off to nd new territory.

THE LONG VIEW

Their extended life span allows elves to take the long view

in nearly every endeavor. Elves rarely hurry, preferring to

take  the  time  to  contemplate  an  action  and  its  potential

consequences before committing to it. Though other races

often argue that elves allow opportunities to pass them by,

the elves know that opportunities nearly always come again,

given enough time, and that opportunities seized without

forethought often turn out to be mistakes.

Taking the long view means that elves, though gener-

ally pleasant to others, take a long time to make friends or

enemies, and they remember both favors and slights for

centuries. Trusting others comes hard to the self-sufcient

elves, and trusting individuals of other races is particularly

difcult  because  they  know  that  the  shorter  life  spans  of

other races give them a much more limited viewpoint and

make them prone to hasty actions.

The elves life span is also responsible for their generally

pleasant  nature.  Even  though  they  are  slow  to  form  true

friendships, they nd it prudent to behave pleasantly toward

others, because they know that grudges can last for centuries.

Thus, unpleasantness avoided is often an enemy not made.

This part of their nature combined with their almost super-

natural beauty tends to endear them to members of other

races, most of whom nd elves to be pleasant and amusing

companions, if a tad aloof and overly meticulous.

NONSPECIALIZATION

Elves unhurried nature combined with their predilection

for self-sufciency results in the curious lack of specializa-

tion that pervades most elf communities. Each elf prefers to

perform all tasks related to basic living himselfno matter

how long it takes. Thus, an elf wishing to build a house rst

consults with other elves who have done so. From them, he

learns the basics of woodcraft, architectural design, and car-

pentry as well as the aspects of the trees and land nearby that

might affect his plans. He designs the structure, taking pains

to ensure that he has allowed for all appropriate contingencies

and included all the design features that he craves. He then

gathers  the  materials  from  the  forest,  prepares  them,  and

begins to build. Until his house is nished, he sleeps in the

open, in a room within his family home, or in some crude

structure that he has fashioned as a temporary shelter. The

elf cares not whether his project takes ve months or fty

years; the only important goal is building a structure to his

own personal specications.

This desire for complete self-sufficiencyor, as some

say, self-indulgencemeans that most elves in any given

community begin their careers with ranks in many different

skills because they have spent considerable time working in

a variety of trades. Basic prociency with the skills required

for daily life require at most one or two ranks, and often an elf

gains no more than this amount of expertise in any particular

skill. Some, however, fall into partial specialization merely

because  they  spend  more  time  performing  activities  they

enjoy than those they do not. For instance, one elf may enjoy

making paintings, while another derives great pleasure from

preparing gourmet meals. Although the cooks food may be

more palatable than the artists, either can produce a perfectly

edible meal.

Though elves often seem carefree and self-indulgent, they

can be focused and relentless while involved in particular

projects. An elf building a house may forget everything else,

losing contact with family and friends, stopping to gather

food only when hunger threatens his focus and his well-being.

Elves rarely worry about family members who disappear into

their work for long periods, knowing that they will return

with  tales to tell and new works to show when  they have

completed their projects. Elves do unobtrusively check on

members of the community who have been absent to ensure

that no accident has befallen them. Disturbing the focus of

an elf absorbed in his work, however, is simply not done.

ELVEN VALUES

Many long-lived races become bored with their lengthy lives,

but elves rarely do. Their love of the natural world allows them

to take pleasure in each new sunrise, hearing the songs of the

birds and feeling the morning dew on their feet as if for the

very rst time. Long separations from boon companions who

have gone adventuring or worked on lengthy projects make

for days and nights of renewed companionship afterward. In

addition, there is always something new to learn, some new

avenue to explore, or some new companion with whom to

spend a few years. Boredom is nearly unknown to elvesthey

consider themselves responsible for their own enjoyment as

much as for their own meals.

The lack of greed that most elves display stems from their

self-sufciency as well as their respect for other beings and

the natural world. Taught from birth that their communi-

ties must be sustainable, they take only what they need for

their personal livelihood and projects. All elves have the

same rights to support themselves, and taking more than

ones share interferes with that right. In the same manner,

elves replant trees that have been cut and ensure that the

resources their communities use are continually renewed

and replenished. To do otherwise would be to doom their

own race as well as others, and elves have little patience with

other races that cannot see this particular truth.

Since elves have no need to exist in the kind of close con-

nes that dwarves occupy and do not have highly specialized

societies, they nd it both easy and logical to place the needs

of the individual above those of the group. Each elf largely

takes care of himself, though all contribute to the community

in one way or another. Disputes happen less frequently than

they do in other humanoid communities because elves are

generally mindful of the rights and boundaries of others and

try to get along with everyone. Thus, though laws do exist,

they are more lightly enforced than they are even in human

settlements  because  every  situation  is  considered  unique.

Anyone who is not happy with the resolution of a dispute in

an elf community is free to leave. No stigma is attached to

those who do so, though an elf who enters a new community

is often treated with a certain reserve for a few decades, until

his neighbors get to know him well.

The highest virtues for an elf are the ability to take care

of himself, skill with magic and art, and a high degree of

personal creativity. Members of less civilized (that is, more

staid) races are looked upon with smug amusement by elves.

Similarly, an elf who is considered frivolous by other races

may be revered as a creative genius by his own people.

While most elves value freedom of expression and creativ-

ity, others nd a degree of comfort in a less chaotic lifestyle.

In particular, elves who wish to devote their entire lives to the

pursuit of a single art may seek out human communities in

which they can purchase the products of others skills rather

than devoting even a short time to becoming completely self-

sufcient. Such elves usually retain their generally pleasant

attitude, but many are so focused on their own art that they

neglect the social interactions so necessary to a specialized

community. Even so, elves tend to t more easily into nonelf

communities  than  other  races  do.  In  particular,  bridging

the worlds of elf and human is not terribly difcult, though

tting into a highly ordered community of dwarves is a trial

for almost any elf.

Elves tend to be quite tolerant of other races, even those

that live very structured lives. This attitude stems from the

elves strong belief in personal choice. If a person or even a

whole group of people wish to become interdependent, they

are free to do so, as long as they do not encroach on the rights

of others to do otherwise. Regardless of his opinion of the

people he meets, a well-brought-up elf considers the habits

and outlooks of his companions to be none of his business.

An old elven platitude states, Only those who are allowed

to make their own mistakes can ever truly succeed.

Roleplaying Application: Many elves take up adventur-

ing for a portion of their lives as young adults, both to see the

world and to gain new experiences. Elves who adventure for a

while are almost always welcomed back into their communi-

ties when they decide to take a break or even retire from the

adventuring life.

Though elves tend to be self-absorbed and may occasionally

appear haughty, they are generally pleasant traveling compan-

ions. Many, however, are unused to working with others in

groups at rst and must come to realize that although others

have their areas of specialty, they can support one another in

ways that jacks-of-all-trades cannot.

Though all elves are ercely independent, other aspects of

an individual character require some denition. What is your

characters personality? What sort of place is he from, and

how do his friends and family back home view him? Does

he feel the need to be completely self-sufcient, or would he

rather work with others to support one anothers strengths?

To what extent does he value personal freedom over the needs

of the group?

ELVEN LIFE

The life of an elf may seem idyllic and tranquil to outsiders,

and indeed many elves enjoy long periods of carefree bliss.

Still, like all mortals, they aspire to greatness, endure conicts

and strife, and mark the passage of time with rituals betting

their culture.

Elven culture is among the richest of any humanoid race.

Their long life span allows elves to pursue their interests for

longer than humans can and to perfect the skills they have

acquired. The result is a complex culture rich in art, knowl-

edge, and all the traits found in the highest of civilizations.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Unlike dwarves, elves value art for its own sake. An object of

art need not be anything but beautiful to be prized in an elf

community. The elves also nd joy in turning mundane objects

into things of beauty. Strictly utilitarian objects are ne in an

emergency, but why not make them beautiful as well? To create

a functional object with no beauty is considered unforgivably

lazy and wasteful of both time and resources.

The  visual  arts  are  highly  valued  in  elf  society,  and

examples abound in every household. Painting, sculpture,

textiles, fashion design, metalwork, weaponsmithing, armor-

smithing, jewelry making, pottery, and all manner of crafts

are  considered  forms  of  self-expression  with  which  every

elf should be procient. Translating ones feelings into an

enduring object of beauty is considered a high achievement

in elven culture.

Architecture is among the most valued of the elven arts,

and  designing  structures  of  grace  and  style  is  a  dream  to

which many young elves aspire. In most cases, the loveliest

elven buildings are those that t seamlessly into the natural

environment: houses built into tree branches, crystal-carved

caverns,  and  ower-festooned  arbors  in  the  wilderness.

Ornamentation  on  such  buildings  is  generally  simple  yet

elegant,  and  done  in  a  manner  that  enhances  rather  than

overwhelms the basic lines of the structure.

Music is also a well-loved form of artistic expression, and

elf bards have rened their art to a high level. Elven music

can be lilting and cheerful, sorrowful and deep, or any style

in between. Elves make more use of utes, lutes, harps, and

exotic stringed instruments than most other cultures, and less

use of loud horns and percussion instruments. Their choices

of instruments and composition styles combine to produce

the delicate melodies for which they are justly famous.

Drama is also a recognized and appreciated art form in elf

the year. Many elves enjoy acting and become quite procient

at it, and this skill stands them in good stead when they must

conduct delicate negotiations with other races.

The elves have raised one form of expression, the written

word, to a higher level than most other races. A few other

races  have  oral  traditions  almost  as  rich  as  those  of  the

elves,  but  Corellons  folk  have  made  a  true  art  of  writing.

Their owing script and lyrical language frame poetry and

prose of inestimable beauty, lled with a depth of emotion

rarely seen in shorter-lived races. The elves live long and see

much, but rather than hardening them, their experiences

serve to enrich their souls. Only through writing does their

depth  of  feeling  become

truly obvious; they tend

to  take  care  what  they

say aloud, particularly

among outsiders.

Most  elves  keep

personal  journals

in  which  they  re-

cord  their  daily  or

weekly  activities.

Writing in a journal

is  an  almost  ritu-

meaning  in  the

events  of  the

them  in  just

the right words

to  convey  the

information  as

if  the  reader  had

been present. Verse

is sometimes used in

journals, but lyrical

prose  is  preferred

by many. Journals of

elves who have died are

often  passed  down  to

other family members as prized heirlooms, and living elves

often trade journals to keep up with one anothers lives or

to gain insight into techniques for crafting items they have

not previously made.

Nearly every form of art and craft is represented in elf

communities. Spontaneous gatherings of musicians or art-

ists are common, and a few of these occasions have evolved

into annual events. Visitors saunter through the area in

which the artists have gathered and comment, visit, and

generally appreciate the art being shown or performed.

Some gatherings require that the art objects be created on

the spot, by either individual artists or groups. Sculptors,

painters, and architects often take part in such events, as do

crafters of various kinds. The items so created are usually

donated to the community at large or presented as gifts to

family, friends, or nobles. The only prizes given at elven

art gatherings are acclamation and special ribbons made of

twined willow branches, but the unofcial benets of win-

ning such prizes are immense. The elf whose work has been

recognized in this way is welcomed in all elf communities

throughout the region.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Though many outsiders assume that elves have little or no

technology, the opposite is true. The elves traditional love

for learning, art, and magic has led them to delve deeply into

many crafts, especially those that result in the creation

of necessary objects that are strong, durable, and

beautiful.  Because  arms,

armor,  fortication,

and stonework are all

too often necessary

for the safety of the

community,  elves

have  long  studied

the arts of metallur-

gy,  engineering,

and  military  ar-

chitecture  with

the intent of pro-

ducing  work

that  demon-

strates both the

creators skill and

The elves penchant

for  learning  to

ensures  that  these

techniques are wide-

spread  among  the

population and that at

least  a  few  masters  of

each kind of craft exist.

Elves prefer magic to machin-

ery and would rather develop a

spell  or  alchemical  substance

than a mechanical device to perform a particular function.

Magically powered constructs, such as golems, are rare but

not unknown among elves. The elves see little purpose in

time- or labor-saving devices because they have plenty of time

to achieve their goals. However, they do appreciate devices

that can protect loved ones and possessions when they are

away for long periods.

Adoption of new magical or technological advances often

happens quickly among elves, who are fascinated with new

developments and eager to try them. However, lasting addi-

tions to the elven arsenal are rare because the elves are just

as eager to try out the next device or spell and abandon the

old if it proves less effective.

Magic  is  as  necessary  to  most  elves  as  breathing.  Even

those who do not become wizards, sorcerers, or bards usually

they do in other humanoid communities because elves are

generally mindful of the rights and boundaries of others and

try to get along with everyone. Thus, though laws do exist,

they are more lightly enforced than they are even in human

settlements  because  every  situation  is  considered  unique.

Anyone who is not happy with the resolution of a dispute in

an elf community is free to leave. No stigma is attached to

those who do so, though an elf who enters a new community

is often treated with a certain reserve for a few decades, until

his neighbors get to know him well.

The highest virtues for an elf are the ability to take care

of himself, skill with magic and art, and a high degree of

personal creativity. Members of less civilized (that is, more

staid) races are looked upon with smug amusement by elves.

Similarly, an elf who is considered frivolous by other races

may be revered as a creative genius by his own people.

While most elves value freedom of expression and creativ-

ity, others nd a degree of comfort in a less chaotic lifestyle.

In particular, elves who wish to devote their entire lives to the

pursuit of a single art may seek out human communities in

which they can purchase the products of others skills rather

than devoting even a short time to becoming completely self-

sufcient. Such elves usually retain their generally pleasant

attitude, but many are so focused on their own art that they

neglect the social interactions so necessary to a specialized

community. Even so, elves tend to t more easily into nonelf

communities  than  other  races  do.  In  particular,  bridging

the worlds of elf and human is not terribly difcult, though

tting into a highly ordered community of dwarves is a trial

for almost any elf.

Elves tend to be quite tolerant of other races, even those

that live very structured lives. This attitude stems from the

elves strong belief in personal choice. If a person or even a

whole group of people wish to become interdependent, they

are free to do so, as long as they do not encroach on the rights

of others to do otherwise. Regardless of his opinion of the

people he meets, a well-brought-up elf considers the habits

and outlooks of his companions to be none of his business.

An old elven platitude states, Only those who are allowed

to make their own mistakes can ever truly succeed.

Roleplaying Application: Many elves take up adventur-

ing for a portion of their lives as young adults, both to see the

world and to gain new experiences. Elves who adventure for a

while are almost always welcomed back into their communi-

ties when they decide to take a break or even retire from the

adventuring life.

Though elves tend to be self-absorbed and may occasionally

appear haughty, they are generally pleasant traveling compan-

ions. Many, however, are unused to working with others in

groups at rst and must come to realize that although others

have their areas of specialty, they can support one another in

ways that jacks-of-all-trades cannot.

Though all elves are ercely independent, other aspects of

an individual character require some denition. What is your

characters personality? What sort of place is he from, and

how do his friends and family back home view him? Does

he feel the need to be completely self-sufcient, or would he

rather work with others to support one anothers strengths?

To what extent does he value personal freedom over the needs

of the group?

ELVEN LIFE

The life of an elf may seem idyllic and tranquil to outsiders,

and indeed many elves enjoy long periods of carefree bliss.

Still, like all mortals, they aspire to greatness, endure conicts

and strife, and mark the passage of time with rituals betting

their culture.

Elven culture is among the richest of any humanoid race.

Their long life span allows elves to pursue their interests for

longer than humans can and to perfect the skills they have

acquired. The result is a complex culture rich in art, knowl-

edge, and all the traits found in the highest of civilizations.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Unlike dwarves, elves value art for its own sake. An object of

art need not be anything but beautiful to be prized in an elf

community. The elves also nd joy in turning mundane objects

into things of beauty. Strictly utilitarian objects are ne in an

emergency, but why not make them beautiful as well? To create

a functional object with no beauty is considered unforgivably

lazy and wasteful of both time and resources.

The  visual  arts  are  highly  valued  in  elf  society,  and

examples abound in every household. Painting, sculpture,

textiles, fashion design, metalwork, weaponsmithing, armor-

smithing, jewelry making, pottery, and all manner of crafts

are  considered  forms  of  self-expression  with  which  every

elf should be procient. Translating ones feelings into an

enduring object of beauty is considered a high achievement

in elven culture.

Architecture is among the most valued of the elven arts,

and  designing  structures  of  grace  and  style  is  a  dream  to

which many young elves aspire. In most cases, the loveliest

elven buildings are those that t seamlessly into the natural

environment: houses built into tree branches, crystal-carved

caverns,  and  ower-festooned  arbors  in  the  wilderness.

Ornamentation  on  such  buildings  is  generally  simple  yet

elegant,  and  done  in  a  manner  that  enhances  rather  than

overwhelms the basic lines of the structure.

Music is also a well-loved form of artistic expression, and

elf bards have rened their art to a high level. Elven music

can be lilting and cheerful, sorrowful and deep, or any style

in between. Elves make more use of utes, lutes, harps, and

exotic stringed instruments than most other cultures, and less

use of loud horns and percussion instruments. Their choices

of instruments and composition styles combine to produce

the delicate melodies for which they are justly famous.

Drama is also a recognized and appreciated art form in elf

communities, and most settlements hold plays throughout

the year. Many elves enjoy acting and become quite procient

at it, and this skill stands them in good stead when they must

conduct delicate negotiations with other races.

consider magic part of their daily lives and use it in the form

of magic items. To an elfs way of thinking, there is almost

nothing that cannot be done wholly or partially by magic.

Because  of  their  highly  individualistic  nature,  elves

frequently develop new spells and create new magic items.

Their aptitude for wielding magic is legendary, though not

all elves choose arcane magic as their lifes work.

Elf communities are sparked with magic in many ways.

Continual ame provides light at night in numerous ways,

and levitate gives access to tree houses for those who do

not wish to encourage visitors by keeping ladders nearby.

Parents keep track of their children via clairaudience/clair-

voyance, and lovers communicate via message and sending. If

magic can make life easier or richer in any way, the elves

have thought of it.

Elves employ arcane magic in all its forms, though wizardry

is  the  most  common  path  to  magical  mastery.  Sorcerers

are  considered  talented  but  amateurish  and  perhaps  a  bit

lazy  because  their  selection  of  spells  is  so  limited.  Many

elf sorcerers specialize in combat or elemental magic, and

quite a few combine arcane magic with the pursuit of some

nonmagical profession, such as ghter, rogue, or ranger. Such

multiclass elves occasionally use spells to enhance their other

talents on the sly, never admitting that they know magic at

all. Adventuring elf sorcerers often hire themselves out to

surface dwellers as mercenaries or master crafters.

Most  elf  arcane  spellcasters  are  wizards.  Despite  the

innately chaotic nature of most elves, the study and discipline

required to employ wizardry appeal to their sense of near-

limitless time and deep personal focus. Those who choose

this path apply themselves zealously to learning the secrets

of the art. Since they have much more time to perfect their

skills than humans do, elves tend to achieve a high degree of

prociency with wizardry even if they become distracted by

other business for a time. Colleges of magic exist in almost

every elf city of any size, and most elf wizards avail themselves

of the resources available at such schools. Many, however,

come to nd such institutions limiting, so they search out

solitary  wizards  with  whom  to  expand  their  training  and

eventually take up research on their own.

Elf spellcasters display no particular preference for any

one  school  of  magic,  but  practitioners  of  necromancy  are

somewhat rare because elves tend toward good alignments.

Enchantment comes almost naturally to elves, many of whom

can beguile other creatures with no magic at all, simply by

virtue of their personal appeal and pleasant nature. Diviners

and conjurers are greatly valued in elf communities for their

abilities to warn of coming danger and to create useful items

and effects, respectively. Evokers are treated with somewhat

less awe by elves than by other races because elves are accus-

tomed to magical effects and tend to value utility and beauty

more than destructive power.

Many elf wizards build themselves towers or strongholds

in which to conduct their research. Such structures are often

placed apart from the community to avoid endangering others

with experiments gone awry.

LOVE

Elves  idealize  the  concept  of  romantic  love  as  much  as

humans do, if not more so. Songs, stories, and poems are

dedicated  to  this  powerful  emotion  in  every  generation.

Nevertheless, to elves, love is more frightening than it is to

humans because loving another enough to share ones whole

life means giving up a measure of the independence that

elves so value. Thus, although the concept of love fascinates

the ever-curious elves, most are in no particular hurry to

nd and embrace it for themselves. Courtships between elf

couples are generally long, often lasting for decades before

the partners commit to marriage.

Paradoxically,  elves  often  nd  it  easier  to  commit  to

long-term  romantic  relationships  with  humans  than  with

other  elves.  The  fty  years  or  so  that  such  a  union  might

last before the death of the human partner is nothing more

than a pleasant interlude for the elfno more than the time

it might take to produce an artistic masterpiece or learn a

new craft. Remaining focused on a single partner for that

amount of time is relatively easy for an elf and allows him

a greater understanding of the lives and thought processes

of shorter-lived races.

A  marriage  between  elves,  however,  is  a  centuries-long

commitment that is never undertaken lightly. Light irta-

tions and even long-term dalliances between elves are more

common than actual marriages. Children produced from

such informal arrangements bear no stigma because new

life is welcome in almost any elf community, whatever the

relationship that produced it.

Though  elves  reach  physical  maturity  at  25,  marriages

almost never occur at such a young age. In practice, elves less

than 100 years old are considered too young for marriage and

are strongly discouraged from considering such a permanent

arrangement until theyve had a few more decades of experi-

ence to understand themselves. No parental or clan consent

is  required  for  courtships;  an  adult  elf  is  free  to  associate

with anyone who accepts his attentionseven someone of

another race. Elves almost never have arranged marriages

because  such  a  concept  is  diametrically  opposed  to  their

ideal of individual freedom.

An elven marriage ceremony can take many forms. Though

it is often a ritual celebrated before the entire community, it

can consist simply of two elves speaking the words that bind

them forever with no witnesses except the trees and the grass.

Most elven weddings are ofciated by a priest of whatever

deity the couple deems appropriate (most often Hanali Celanil,

but sometimes Corellon Larethian). The two elves write and

speak their own vows, and the priest uses their own words

to seal the union. Thus, an exchange of vows amounts to an

exchange of life essence that forever bonds one to the other.

Dowries are not usually exchanged unless the marriage is

of considerable political import, though gifts to the newly

wedded couple from the community are common.

Though elves rarely fall out of love with one another and

almost never remarry after the death of a spouse, they often

1

E

T

P

A

H

C

S

E

V

L

E

12

do spend time away from one another as a means of refreshing

the relationship. Such vacations from one another keep a

marriage fresh and vital by allowing each partner to grow

independently of the other.

Outsiders often mistakenly believe that elves have little

love for family, friends, and community because they may

leave home for years at a time to follow their own desires.

However,  while  elves  are  undeniably  self-centered,  they

usually harbor deep-seated affection for their families and

friends. The extent of that affection can be seen in their

willingness to let go and trust that their loved ones will

return to share more time with them. Indeed, when an elf

who has been absent from his community for an extended

period decides to return home, little can stand in his way,

and the joy of his loved ones upon his return is boundless

indeed. Celebrations extending for weeks often surround

the  return  of  a  long-absent  member  of  the  community,

who doubtless has many tales to tell of his travels. Such

stories serve to enrich the understanding and the lore of

the entire community.

Reproduction

Though an elf reaches mental and physical maturity at the

age of 25, very few elves become parents until much later in

life. Elves rarely feel that theyre ready to settle down and

begin families before theyre at least 100 years old, and most

stop having children soon after reaching the age of 200. Elf

children are not as numerous as one might expect, given the

length of an elfs child-rearing years, because elves are less

fertile than humans and other shorter-lived races. A typical

human  couple  might  have  one  to  four  children  over  the

course of a decade, but an elf couple might take fty years

to have the same number of children.

Elves have a gestation period of approximately nine months,

just as humans and other similarly sized creatures do. Once a

child is born, his or her parents usually raise the youngster for

the rst few years, and then foster him or her out to a succes-

sion of older relatives until he or she reaches maturity. This

practice provides training for the child in a variety of areas

and allows the parents to return to the pursuit of their own

interests.  It  also  encourages  young  elves  to  develop  their

own sense of self and a degree of personal independence.

ELVES AT WAR

Elves consider war a last resort for resolving disputes. Though

they  are  by  no  means  cowardly,  they  know  that  they  can

expect to live for hundreds of years, and they are loath to risk

their lives over petty issues. Since virtually all elves are in

accord on this point, they almost never war against their own

kind, except for periodic skirmishing between surface elves

and drow. The same sentiment prevents elves from declaring

war on other beings unless the situation is dire and the fate

of the world hangs in the balance.

Not all sentient beings share the elves live and let live

credo. Tribes of orcs, renegade dwarves, and even imperialistic

human kingdoms have long coveted elf lands and resources,

and many have tried to seize the holdings of their more paci-

stic neighbors by force of arms. Thus, even the peace-loving

elves must have adequate defenses for their settlements.

All elves learn the use of the bow and the sword while still

young so that they can help to defend their ancestral lands

from  invaders  of  any  kind.  Such  training  commences  for

both males and females at about 15 years of age.

Because of their general unwillingness to risk their lives

unnecessarily, the elves rst line of defense is usually the

longbow, allowing them to slay their enemies from a distance.

(This tactic is especially effective in circumstances when they

can  use  their  low-light  vision  to  decimate  foes  before  the

enemy can even see them.) Elven culture does not demean

the bravery of a warrior who drops his enemies from afar.

After all, allowing a larger and stronger foe to engage in melee

combat is folly, not courage. Foes that manage to threaten an

elf at melee range are usually met with a ashing longsword

or rapier.

Most elf settlements augment their defenses with arcane

magic. Alarm spells and other defensive dweomers placed

around the perimeter of elf territory warn of the approach of

intruders, and elf wizards regularly employ scrying to ensure

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

ELVES AND ADULTHOOD

Table  64  of  the  Players  Handbook  suggests  that  elves  dont

reach their full physical growth until an age of 110, at a mini-

mum. Thats not entirely accurate. The random starting age for

elves is simply the age at which many elf adventurers feel ready

to leave their forests and roam the world outside for a time. More

than a few elves have commenced their adventuring careers at

much younger ages.

Elf children grow almost as swiftly as human children to age

15 or so; a 10-year-old elf boy and a 10-year-old human boy are

nearly  the  same  size  and  have  similar  mental  and  emotional

maturity.  The  elf  will  be  shorter  and  slighter  than  his  human

playmate. He is also quite likely to be more patient, observant,

and self-sufficient, simply due to the influence of growing up in

an elf household.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Humans finish their filling out and full adult growth by

about age 20, but elves take a little longer, rarely reaching their

full height and weight before age 25. After that, elves remain

virtually timeless, decade after decade. Not even another elf

can tell at  a  glance whether an elf  is 25, 50, or 100 years of

age. A few minutes conversation quickly dispels the mystery,

of  course;  elves  gain  experience,  grace,  emotional  maturity,

patience, and wisdom throughout these ageless decades. Even

so, some elves are remarkably poised for their age, and some

elven romances tell the tale of a grieving elf of 150 years of age

discovering life and joy again in new lover of only 25 or 30 who

carries himself or herself like an elf of 100.

Paradoxically,  elves  often  nd  it  easier  to  commit  to

long-term  romantic  relationships  with  humans  than  with

other  elves.  The  fty  years  or  so  that  such  a  union  might

last before the death of the human partner is nothing more

than a pleasant interlude for the elfno more than the time

it might take to produce an artistic masterpiece or learn a

new craft. Remaining focused on a single partner for that

amount of time is relatively easy for an elf and allows him

a greater understanding of the lives and thought processes

of shorter-lived races.

A  marriage  between  elves,  however,  is  a  centuries-long

commitment that is never undertaken lightly. Light irta-

tions and even long-term dalliances between elves are more

common than actual marriages. Children produced from

such informal arrangements bear no stigma because new

life is welcome in almost any elf community, whatever the

relationship that produced it.

Though  elves  reach  physical  maturity  at  25,  marriages

almost never occur at such a young age. In practice, elves less

than 100 years old are considered too young for marriage and

are strongly discouraged from considering such a permanent

arrangement until theyve had a few more decades of experi-

ence to understand themselves. No parental or clan consent

is  required  for  courtships;  an  adult  elf  is  free  to  associate

with anyone who accepts his attentionseven someone of

another race. Elves almost never have arranged marriages

because  such  a  concept  is  diametrically  opposed  to  their

ideal of individual freedom.

An elven marriage ceremony can take many forms. Though

it is often a ritual celebrated before the entire community, it

can consist simply of two elves speaking the words that bind

them forever with no witnesses except the trees and the grass.

Most elven weddings are ofciated by a priest of whatever

deity the couple deems appropriate (most often Hanali Celanil,

but sometimes Corellon Larethian). The two elves write and

speak their own vows, and the priest uses their own words

to seal the union. Thus, an exchange of vows amounts to an

exchange of life essence that forever bonds one to the other.

Dowries are not usually exchanged unless the marriage is

of considerable political import, though gifts to the newly

wedded couple from the community are common.

Though elves rarely fall out of love with one another and

almost never remarry after the death of a spouse, they often

1

do spend time away from one another as a means of refreshing

the relationship. Such vacations from one another keep a

marriage fresh and vital by allowing each partner to grow

independently of the other.

Outsiders often mistakenly believe that elves have little

love for family, friends, and community because they may

leave home for years at a time to follow their own desires.

However,  while  elves  are  undeniably  self-centered,  they

usually harbor deep-seated affection for their families and

friends. The extent of that affection can be seen in their

willingness to let go and trust that their loved ones will

return to share more time with them. Indeed, when an elf

who has been absent from his community for an extended

period decides to return home, little can stand in his way,

and the joy of his loved ones upon his return is boundless

indeed. Celebrations extending for weeks often surround

the  return  of  a  long-absent  member  of  the  community,

who doubtless has many tales to tell of his travels. Such

stories serve to enrich the understanding and the lore of

the entire community.

Reproduction

Though an elf reaches mental and physical maturity at the

age of 25, very few elves become parents until much later in

life. Elves rarely feel that theyre ready to settle down and

begin families before theyre at least 100 years old, and most

stop having children soon after reaching the age of 200. Elf

children are not as numerous as one might expect, given the

length of an elfs child-rearing years, because elves are less

fertile than humans and other shorter-lived races. A typical

human  couple  might  have  one  to  four  children  over  the

course of a decade, but an elf couple might take fty years

to have the same number of children.

Elves have a gestation period of approximately nine months,

just as humans and other similarly sized creatures do. Once a

child is born, his or her parents usually raise the youngster for

the rst few years, and then foster him or her out to a succes-

sion of older relatives until he or she reaches maturity. This

practice provides training for the child in a variety of areas

and allows the parents to return to the pursuit of their own

interests.  It  also  encourages  young  elves  to  develop  their

own sense of self and a degree of personal independence.

ELVES AT WAR

Elves consider war a last resort for resolving disputes. Though

they  are  by  no  means  cowardly,  they  know  that  they  can

expect to live for hundreds of years, and they are loath to risk

their lives over petty issues. Since virtually all elves are in

accord on this point, they almost never war against their own

kind, except for periodic skirmishing between surface elves

and drow. The same sentiment prevents elves from declaring

war on other beings unless the situation is dire and the fate

of the world hangs in the balance.

Not all sentient beings share the elves live and let live

credo. Tribes of orcs, renegade dwarves, and even imperialistic

human kingdoms have long coveted elf lands and resources,

and many have tried to seize the holdings of their more paci-

stic neighbors by force of arms. Thus, even the peace-loving

elves must have adequate defenses for their settlements.

All elves learn the use of the bow and the sword while still

young so that they can help to defend their ancestral lands

from  invaders  of  any  kind.  Such  training  commences  for

both males and females at about 15 years of age.

Because of their general unwillingness to risk their lives

unnecessarily, the elves rst line of defense is usually the

longbow, allowing them to slay their enemies from a distance.

(This tactic is especially effective in circumstances when they

can  use  their  low-light  vision  to  decimate  foes  before  the

enemy can even see them.) Elven culture does not demean

the bravery of a warrior who drops his enemies from afar.

After all, allowing a larger and stronger foe to engage in melee

combat is folly, not courage. Foes that manage to threaten an

elf at melee range are usually met with a ashing longsword

or rapier.

Most elf settlements augment their defenses with arcane

magic. Alarm spells and other defensive dweomers placed

around the perimeter of elf territory warn of the approach of

intruders, and elf wizards regularly employ scrying to ensure

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

ELVES AND ADULTHOOD

Table  64  of  the  Players  Handbook  suggests  that  elves  dont

reach their full physical growth until an age of 110, at a mini-

mum. Thats not entirely accurate. The random starting age for

elves is simply the age at which many elf adventurers feel ready

to leave their forests and roam the world outside for a time. More

than a few elves have commenced their adventuring careers at

much younger ages.

Elf children grow almost as swiftly as human children to age

15 or so; a 10-year-old elf boy and a 10-year-old human boy are

nearly  the  same  size  and  have  similar  mental  and  emotional

maturity.  The  elf  will  be  shorter  and  slighter  than  his  human

playmate. He is also quite likely to be more patient, observant,

and self-sufficient, simply due to the influence of growing up in

an elf household.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Humans finish their filling out and full adult growth by

about age 20, but elves take a little longer, rarely reaching their

full height and weight before age 25. After that, elves remain

virtually timeless, decade after decade. Not even another elf

can tell at  a  glance whether an elf  is 25, 50, or 100 years of

age. A few minutes conversation quickly dispels the mystery,

of  course;  elves  gain  experience,  grace,  emotional  maturity,

patience, and wisdom throughout these ageless decades. Even

so, some elves are remarkably poised for their age, and some

elven romances tell the tale of a grieving elf of 150 years of age

discovering life and joy again in new lover of only 25 or 30 who

carries himself or herself like an elf of 100.

natural  agility  and

Such elves may patrol

the  perimeters  of  their

lands in loose warbands or serve

with an informal militia in their

towns.  An  elf  warrior  with  some

experience under his belt may choose to become a wild-

runner (see page 139), ranging far and wide within the

forest, or rise to leadership of the local militia and pro-

vide weapons training for younger elves. A few choose to

take their talents on the road upon reaching adulthood

by becoming adventurers.

AGING AND DEATH

Elves are blessed with extraordinarily long life spans and

a  graceful,  easy  aging  process  that  features  none  of  the

ravages of disease, in rmity, or atrophy that plague other

folk. Time does not even begin to touch an elf until she

passes  a  century  and  a  half  in  age.  For  two  full  human

lifetimes, sometimes three, she remains in the bloom of

youth, her features virtually indistinguishable from those

of a 20-year-old elf girl.

Elves do eventually age, but their aging takes a form not

seen in other races. Their faces remain unlined, their hair

remains ungrayed, and their skin remains smooth and strong,

but  middle-aged  elves  begin  to  develop  a  sort  of  ethereal-

ness or otherworldly quality, as their spirits burn brighter

and stronger than their bodies can endure. In the course of

their lifetimes, elves undergo a living transformation from

beings of  esh and blood to beings of spirit and light, for

lack of a better description. Physical strength, quickness,

and hardiness slowly fade (elves lose and gain ability score

points on Table 65 in the Players Handbook, just like other

races), but elves suffer no pain, dif culty, or sickness in their

aging. Even though

their  bodies

grow weaker,

they  enjoy

good  health

and  physical

beauty until the

moment of death.

While others may

fulness  of  an

herself  is  not.

physicality erodes,

she  leaves  her

warrior  duties  for

younger and more vigorous

elves and moves on to different roles

and responsibilitiesoften instruct-

ing those who follow in her footsteps, or perhaps taking

up an artistic pursuit.

Though elves live extremely long lives compared with most

other humanoids, they are not immortal. They do not court

death and indeed try to avoid encountering it prematurely,

but they do not especially fear the end. Rather, they accept

death as a natural part of the life cycle. Their deep respect for

nature ensures that most do not pursue unnatural means of

preserving life (such as becoming a lich) when their bodies

begin to fail.

A few elves embark on a  nal journey when they feel that

the end is near. Such elves often go planewalking in search

of the fabled elf homeland of Arvandor, the home plane

of Corellon Larethian, the Creator of the Elves. Most live

out their  nal years in their own homes in the company of

family and friends. Death in combat is considered honorable

if the  ght was for a high principle, but such a death is never

sought. Elves do not share the dwarves goal of dying with

their boots on; instead, they prefer to depart the world in

peace and comfort.

In most elf communities, funerals are simple ceremonies

designed to speed the soul on its way and reunite the body

with the natural world. When an elf dies, his family and

friends anoint his body with precious oils and dress it in

the deceaseds favorite clothing. They often clip locks of the

dead elfs hair to keep as personal mementoes of the loved

one. The body is then placed on a bier atop a tall tree and left

open to the sky for a single night. Mourners may pay their

respects during this time, and those close to the deceased

usually sing the elven mourning song, a wordless melody

of such poignant sorrow that outsiders who hear it never

forget its haunting beauty. The following morning, a cleric

of Sehanine Moonbow or Corellon Larethian performs a

celebratory ceremony to mark the deceaseds departure of this

world for the next. The ritual culminates in the casting of the

dust to dust spell (see page 174), which dissipates the corpse to

the winds. This spell ensures that no foul necromancer can

violate the remains, circumvents the need for a tomb, and

speeds the process of reuniting the body of the deceased with

the natural world. After the body is gone, the community

holds poetry readings, art shows, and other cultural events

in honor of the deceased.

Should an elf die in a situation where displaying the body

to the sky is impractical and no cleric is present to take care

of the remains, the body is simply wrapped in clean linen

and buried. The grave is marked so that the remains can be

retrieved and cared for properly at some later time.

No matter how the remains are handled, loved ones create

a shrine in memory of the dead elf in the ensuing months.

The site is always some natural placea tree hollow, a small

cavern, or a quiet spot beside a rushing stream. Each member

of the community who wishes to do so creates a piece of

arta small statue, a jewelry design, a poem, or some other

artistic remembranceand places it in the shrine. Particu-

larly famous elves are often commemorated in murals or other

artwork in the community at large, as well.

ELF SOCIETY

AND CULTURE

Elf communities are far less structured than the settlements

of more lawful creatures. Though they tend to be loose

aggregates of individuals rather than orderly clan holdings,

their residents still share common goals and work together

when needed. Traditions are guidelines, not rules, and new

ideas that offer better methods of managing group life are

always welcomed.

The  section  that  follows  details  the  framework  of  elf

society as well as more humble issues that figure into an

elfs daily life.

Roleplaying  Application:  This  section  deals  with  the

day-to-day aspects of elf society, elements that are considered

common  knowledge  and  the  basic  assumptions  that  elves

make about the world. Consider which of these assumptions

your character accepts, which he does not, and how open he

might be to the alternate ways proposed by other races.

NONSPECIALIZED COMMUNITIES

Unlike the communities of almost any other humanoid

race, elf communities are for the most part nonspecialized.

That is, no one pursues a profession to the exclusion of all

others. There is no butcher, no baker, no weaponsmith, and

no armorer. Rather, every citizen  nds or makes what he

needs on his own. Every elf learns how to cook a passable

meal, how to make serviceable clothing and weapons, how

to gather food from the forest, how to care for wounds, and

how to build a shelter.

Should an elf fall ill or be disabled, his friends and family

pitch in to provide for his needs until he recovers. He is

expected to repay that debt by performing services to those

in need within the community, but no set requirements

exist. Should he fail to satisfy his debt in the eyes of the

community, however, he can expect no aid in future times

of trouble.

Elves are expected to acquire the raw materials for their

work on their own. However, when a particular material is in

short supply, communal stores are gathered. Any elf in the

community has free access to these stores and may take what

he needs. Should a communitys supplies be exhausted, the

last individual known to have accessed the stores is tasked

with replenishing them, no matter how far a eld he might

need to go to do so.

Because of their nearly complete self-sufficiency, elves

rarely need to buy anything from anyone else. Thus, there

is little need for money in elf society. Most elves have a few

coins that they have gained through adventuring or by selling

their wares to other races, but an elf can get along perfectly

well with no money at all inside his own community. To an

elf, there is far more value in beauty than in currency.

Despite the fact that anyone can take care of his or her basic

needs within an elf community, a degree of specialization

does  creep  in  simply  because  certain  elves  prefer  certain

activities and become better at them than other elves. For

example,  one  elf  might  have  a  passion  for  designing  and

building homes, while another prefers to produce clothing.

A natural solution is for the  rst elf to build a home for

the second (after completing his own), and for the second

elf to provide garments and linens for the  rst one for the

duration  of  the  project.  Such  barter  is  common  within

almost  any  elf  community  and  is  looked  upon  as  an

elegant solution that allows each individual to pursue his

or her passion. No single elf is ever expected to provide a

particular service for the entire community, however, and

no barter arrangement can occur unless both parties agree

to the terms.

LEADERS

Though elven royalty does exist, leadership is not neces-

sarily passed down from parent to child, as is often the

case in human lands. The leaders of an elf community are

usually chosen by acclamation; they are the people who the

residents go to with disputes or issues that affect the com-

munity at large. Many famous kings and queens attained

their positions through effective use of magic or strategy

in times of war, but some are chosen for their wisdom in

resolving disputes and their ability to take charge when

trouble strikes.

Abdications occasionally occur, and rulers often simply

retire when they grow weary of the affairs of state. Occa-

sionally,  a  ruler  so  respects  the  wisdom  of  a  particular

advisor that he shares the leadership of the community

with that person.

Successors are often members of the current leaders family

or inner circle, because they learn early how to manage a

community of highly independent individuals. When the

queen is busy, its natural for her to ask her son or consort if

he can help. The current ruler may also suggest a successor to

the community. Though it is rare for the residents to refuse

a named successor, they are under no obligation to accept

him or her.

Disputes over leadership are rare; when they do occur,

they  are  almost  never  resolved  through  violent  means.

Leaders are not as important to the highly independent

elves as they are to members of more lawful races, and

disputes  over  such  positions  are  not  worth  the  risk  of

life. In cases where multiple candidates want a leadership

position,  the  candidates  present  their  qualifications  to

the  community  in  a  large  gathering,  and  the  residents

choose  between  them.  Such  gatherings  often  feature

impassioned oratory on the part of the candidates, and

occasionally a quest. Should a contest be heated enough

to sharply divide the community, one of the candidates

may choose to leave, taking his or her followers along to

found a new community.

An elf king or queen typically rules over only one com-

munity. No overking, emperor, or other such ruler exists,

because central authority is foreign to the chaotic elven soul.

Each community is self-contained, but it may trade with

other elf cities and even the settlements of other races. Still,

should it become necessary, each community can survive on

its own. An elf ruler may make alliances on behalf of his own

community but not on behalf of others. Such a decentralized

structure often confounds other races; to the elves, it seems

merely practical.

An elf ruler is expected to mediate major disputes, plan

for the communitys welfare, see that expansion does not

threaten the natural resources of the area, and ensure for a

proper defense. He can require each individual to contribute

to community stores as needed and call forth militias for the

common defense. He represents the community in its deal-

ings with other races and other elf settlements. Nevertheless,

he is also free to pursue his own interests when time permits,

just like any other elf. Furthermore, unless he chooses to

adventure,  he  rarely  gains  signicantly  more  wealth  than

any other elf.

As might be expected, elf rulers generally consult a cadre

of elders or advisors when making their decisions. However,

anyone in the community who wants to advise the ruler on

a particular topic may do so. The ruler is free to consult with

those whose opinions he most respects, and most rulers tend

to consult the same individuals over and over again. There is

no set limit to the number of advisors a king or queen may

have, and the number typically uctuates over time. Many

rulers  consult  family  members  for  advice,  and  a  few  also

regularly consult with individuals who oppose them, in order

to demonstrate the fairness expected of a ruler.

COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

A noble, advised by an informal group of condants, typi-

cally heads an elf community. The nobles title varies with

the size of the community; a noble governing a village or

town is generally known as a lord or lady, the ruler of a

city is a prince or princess, and the ruler of a larger realm

is a king or queen. A rulers advisors are usually known as

elders, regardless of their age. They may or may not be family

members, and they need not all be elves. In particular, rulers

who have tasted the adventuring life often invite their old

companions to live in the elf community, or to enjoy long

vacations there. Such companions are often counted among

the rulers advisors.

Officials

Though the ruler is nominally in charge of all major func-

tions  of  the  community,  including  food,  shelter,  defense,

judiciary,  and  training,  the  day-to-day  functions  of  these

tasks are delegated to others within the community. Almost

every community has a captain of the watch, a master builder,

a stores master, a guardian of nature, a keeper of the lore, a

master of arms, and a high priest. Technically, all these ofces

except high priest are bestowed by appointment, but in reality

the elf who most often performs the task is given the title. The

ofcial then holds the title until he or she resigns from the

post or is found incompetent by the ruler.

Captain of the Watch: This ofcial commands the patrols

that roam the area around the settlement. She ensures that the

patrols evenly cover the desired area, receives their reports,

and  passes  along  any  useful  information  to  the  ruler  and

elders. When large gatherings occur, the captain of the watch

may assign a patrol of guards to keep the peace.

Watch  patrols  normally  consist  of  a  handful  of  elf  war-

riors led by a slightly more experienced warrior or ghter.

The patrols keep watch for intruders, predatory beasts, and

anything unusual, such as trees dying for no apparent reason.

No creature is challenged unless it appears likely to approach

within a dened distance of the elf community. A challenge

usually consists of a warning shot accompanied by a verbal

warning to stay clear, if the intruder is a sentient being. Watch

parties may be assigned to hunt in the forest if supplies of

meat are low in the community.

Master Builder: The master builder coordinates the building

within an elf community. Anyone wishing to build a dwell-

ing or other structure must consult with him and convince

him of the suitability of the chosen site before building may

commence. The master builder ensures that new buildings do

not crowd others and t in well aesthetically with the town.

If requested to do so, he may also provide advice and guid-

ance in the construction process. The master builder decides

when a community has reached its maximum sustainable

size based on the available resources. When this occurs, no

more new houses may be built in that area. Elves wishing to

build new dwellings must depart and nd another location

in which to found a community.

Stores Master: Charged with keeping sufcient food

and water stores to sustain the community through periods

of drought or other disaster, the stores master periodically

checks  the  communitys  stores  of  dried  meat  and  fruit,

root vegetables, and grain, as well as the cisterns in which

rainwater is stored. She also checks the stored provisions to

ensure that they have not spoiled, been poisoned, or other-

wise rendered unusable. When supplies dip below the levels

needed to sustain the entire community for three months,

the stores master reports the decit to the ruler, who sends

out parties to search for food.

In some communities, the stores master also monitors

stores of nonedible supplies such as lamp oil, tindertwigs,

alchemical items, parchment, ink, tools, and weapons. Other

communities  delegate  the  responsibility  for  such  items

to different officials or do not keep track of them at all,

trusting to individual citizens to meet their own needs for

these materials.

Guardian of Nature: This ofcial is responsible for ensur-

ing that the elves live harmoniously with nature in their area.

Often a druid, he oversees the communitys gardens and cares

for the local wildlife. He also ensures that the community

replenishes what it takes and that its presence does not harm

the natural world.

Keeper of the Lore: The keeper of the lore gathers and

archives magical knowledge and advancements from the

community and records them for posterity. He keeps the

scrolls and tomes that contain this knowledge in a large,

central library that is open to all citizens. On occasion, the

library may be made available to outsiders with special needs,

but only with the permission of the keeper or the ruler.

Master of Arms: The master of arms trains the young elves

in the community in the use of weapons and teaches them

self-defense. Under her tutelage, they learn to move sound-

lessly through the woods and melt back into the trees after

attacking. She also plans expeditions for hunting, exploration,

or other purposes. In some communities, the master of arms

manages the armory, ensuring that the weapons used by the

watch patrols are honed and ready for use at all times.

High Priest: The high priest of an elf community is usually

the senior cleric of Corellon Larethian, though the post can

be held by a cleric of any deity revered in the community. The

high priest coordinates the functions of the various temples to

ensure that the spiritual needs of the community are met. He

ofciates at most of the weddings and funeral services, tailor-

ing them for the specic individuals and families involved.

In times of war or hardship, the high priest coordinates not

only the clerics of his own church but also those of the other

churches in the community to provide healing, emergency

food, and other aid.

Judiciary

When a dispute arises among elves that the participants

cannot resolve, they may bring the matter to any three or more

elders whom they can convince to gather in the same place.

All parties to the dispute must agree on the elders chosen.

In most communities, each party to the dispute chooses

two seconds who are familiar with the situation. One of these

seconds presents the argument to the elders on behalf of the

plaintiff or defendant, who remains unnamed. In this way, the

elders theoretically do not know for whom they are deciding.

The seconds present evidence and witnesses as required, and

then the elders render a decision that is considered binding.

Only the ruler may overturn the decision of the elders, and

he may choose to hear or not hear an appeal.

ELVEN FAMILIES

Visitors to elf communities are often bewildered about the

apparent lack of family life. In truth, elves love their families

as much as humans or dwarves do; they simply do not feel the

need to spend all their time with their relatives. After all, in

a life that lasts hundreds of years, theres plenty of time for

family and other interests as well.

Wedded elf couples usually establish a joint home, though

some also maintain individual residences to which they can

retreat whenever they want some distance from their spouses.

Unwedded couples sometimes establish joint homes, but

they more often continue to maintain their own houses and

cohabit in one or the other.

A pregnant elf is expected to limit her activities as much

as necessary to ensure the birth of a healthy child. Because

children are not common among elves, each new life is pre-

cious to the community. Thus, everyone pitches in to care for

the expectant mother and her child after the childs birth.

Children are always acknowledged by both parents and

welcomed by the community in a celebration. Half-elf chil-

dren born within the community are often welcomed with

as much joy as full elves. When a child is born, the parents

usually rear her jointly for the rst ten years or so of her

life, whether they are wedded or not. Thereafter, the child

becomes the responsibility of the whole community. The

child lives in the home of one or the other parent (which-

ever wishes to provide the child with a home) but is free to

play with other elf children and visit with other adults to

her hearts content. Members of the community take turns

watching over the children at play and ensuring their safety.

Any adult may teach or discipline any child, and everyone

in the community knows who every childs parents are.

Upon reaching the age of 20, a child is usually fostered

out to an older relative, either in the same community or

another. This relative is one who has the time and energy

to teach the youngster an advanced craft. A child may be

fostered with several relatives before nally coming of age,

learning different skills and family lore from each. Its not

uncommon for elves to repeat this process of fostering and

studying for the rst hundred years of their lives. However,

in particularly threatening times, the need for warriors may

lead to elf youths taking on adult responsibilities almost as

quickly as humans might.

Upon coming of age, a young elf is typically offered a choice

of homes by parents and the family members who fostered

her. She may choose among these offers or build her own

advisor that he shares the leadership of the community

with that person.

Successors are often members of the current leaders family

or inner circle, because they learn early how to manage a

community of highly independent individuals. When the

queen is busy, its natural for her to ask her son or consort if

he can help. The current ruler may also suggest a successor to

the community. Though it is rare for the residents to refuse

a named successor, they are under no obligation to accept

him or her.

Disputes over leadership are rare; when they do occur,

they  are  almost  never  resolved  through  violent  means.

Leaders are not as important to the highly independent

elves as they are to members of more lawful races, and

disputes  over  such  positions  are  not  worth  the  risk  of

life. In cases where multiple candidates want a leadership

position,  the  candidates  present  their  qualifications  to

the  community  in  a  large  gathering,  and  the  residents

choose  between  them.  Such  gatherings  often  feature

impassioned oratory on the part of the candidates, and

occasionally a quest. Should a contest be heated enough

to sharply divide the community, one of the candidates

may choose to leave, taking his or her followers along to

found a new community.

An elf king or queen typically rules over only one com-

munity. No overking, emperor, or other such ruler exists,

because central authority is foreign to the chaotic elven soul.

Each community is self-contained, but it may trade with

other elf cities and even the settlements of other races. Still,

should it become necessary, each community can survive on

its own. An elf ruler may make alliances on behalf of his own

community but not on behalf of others. Such a decentralized

structure often confounds other races; to the elves, it seems

merely practical.

An elf ruler is expected to mediate major disputes, plan

for the communitys welfare, see that expansion does not

threaten the natural resources of the area, and ensure for a

proper defense. He can require each individual to contribute

to community stores as needed and call forth militias for the

common defense. He represents the community in its deal-

ings with other races and other elf settlements. Nevertheless,

he is also free to pursue his own interests when time permits,

adventure,  he  rarely  gains  signicantly  more  wealth  than

dwelling right away. Most, however, choose to dwell with

an older relative for some time or to go out adventuring for

a few years.

Because of their close association with multiple family

members, elves tend to develop strong bonds with their

families, though their independent nature prevents them

from feeling physically tied to one person or place. Elves often

travel for long periods during their adult lives, then return

with tales to tell their loved ones. Though the absent elves

are missed, their families know they will return eventually

if no misfortune befalls them.

Elderly elves often retire to their own estates within the

community after having lived long and full lives. Most retain

their ties with family and friends until the end. Free of the

ravages of age, elderly elves remain perfectly self-sufcient

until the very end of their days. Elderly elves are honored

by all, and any disrespect to an older elf is considered a seri-

ous breach of etiquette. Because elves retain their mental

acuity throughout their lives, elderly elves are considered

storehouses of knowledge. Many dictate their memoirs to

younger elves to preserve them for posterity.

ELVES AND OTHER RACES

Because of their physical beauty and their generally mild

temperaments,  elves  are  welcomed  by  almost  all  other

sentient beings. They can nd something in common with

most beings they encounter, and they tend to accentuate the

positive in their dealings with other races.

Elf communities often form alliances with nearby humans

and raptorans to the benet of all involved. When war threatens

with any neighboring community, elves always try negotia-

tion rst in hopes of avoiding open conict. Though they do

not negotiate away any of their rights, they do attempt to nd

a solution that will benet both parties. Only in rare cases

do they fail to come to agreement with their enemies.

Dwarves:  Given  the  widely  disparate  outlooks  of  elves

and dwarves, it is no wonder that their diplomatic relations

tend to be difcult. Dwarves subjugate the individual in

favor of the group, and elves do the opposite. Both ways of

life work for the races that embrace them, but this difference

in emphasis makes it difcult for the two groups to agree on

specic plans. Elves tend to see dwarves as dour and lacking

in humor, whereas dwarves nd elves to be ighty, ckle, and

irresponsible, given their apparent lack of focus on family.

Despite their differences, the two races agree on most issues

of importance because both are basically good. Though they

may shout, pout, and hurl insults at one another in the heat

of negotiations, they stand shoulder to shoulder in the face

of outside threats.

Gnomes: Though many gnomes are skilled with arcane

magic, few seem to be serious in pursuit of its secrets. Gnomes

tend to treat magic as nothing more than parlor tricks with

which to confound and amuse companions instead of study-

ing it in depth and wresting its secrets from the cosmos the

way elves do. Of course, gnomes are somewhat shorter-lived

than elves, so they cannot be expected to delve as deeply as

an elf can into any subject. Still, even humans treat magic

with more respect than gnomes do.

Though elves may consider gnomes trivial and somewhat

frivolous, they recognize in them a love of music equal to their

own. Though the music of gnomes varies more in style than

the haunting refrains that characterize elven tunes, gnomes

have developed a degree of artistry with sound unrivaled

by any other race. Gnome bards are always welcome in elf

communities, and some even compete in festivals of the arts

alongside elves.

Halings: Most elves dont quite know what to make

of halings. The little folk seem incredibly charming, and

most elves greatly enjoy their company. On the other hand,

elves often have the sense that halings are holding back

somehowwhich they often are. Halings are somewhat

in awe of elves and tend to be on their best behavior around

them. This reticence on the part of halings to be fully them-

selves often leads elves to consider them somewhat stodgy,

but this impression couldnt be farther from the truth. When

halings spend long periods in the realms of the elves, they

tend to come out of their shells and reveal their fun-loving

nature. However, most halings limit their visits to such

places because of their natural desire to see and do a variety

of things.

Elves value halings ability to t into almost any group and

to charm others into seeing things their way with honeyed

words. They also realize, however, that honeyed words and

sticky ngers frequently go together, so elves rarely invite

halings to visit places that shelter valuable artifacts.  Elves

also respect the halings desire to avoid conictan attitude

they share, though not for the same reasons.

Because of their charming nature, the interesting tales

they tell, and the trade goods they bring, halings are always

welcome in elf communities. Occasionally, elves even seek

the aid of halings for ventures in which their particular

skills would be useful.

Half-Elves: Elves look on half-elves as relatives who are

deserving of welcome in their communities. Many view

them with a touch of pity because their elf blood gives them

such promise, but their human blood condemns them to early

death. Others perceive in them a vibrancy and a zest for life

rarely seen in elves.

Given the elven penchant for individuality, it would be

incorrect to assume that all elves feel the same way about

anything. There are always some who have difculty looking

past a half-elfs heritage, seeing it as impure, inferior, or repug-

nant depending on the circumstances of the childs birth.

Even for those untroubled by a childs non-elf parentage,

it can be difcult to deny the physical differences between

half-elf and elf children. On that basis alone, some elf adults

have difculty hiding their disdain and pity for a child who

cannot compete with his peersa heavy burden for a child

of any race to bear.

Beyond those considerations, elves refuse to categorize

half-elves, according each the respect as an individual that

1

E

T

A

H

C

L

18

would be the birthright of any full elf. In particular, elves

realize  that  some  half-elves  do  not  share  their  chaotic

viewpoint, though half-elves often understand it better than

members of other races do. For that reason, elves may nd

half-elves to be valuable go-betweens in negotiations with

some lawful-aligned races.

Half-Orcs: The racial enmity between elves and orcs

goes back to the creation of the races and the legendary

battle between Corellon Larethian and Gruumsh, the orc

deity. According to the legend, elves sprang from the drops

of Corellons blood that was shed while the two fought.

Because the Creator of the Elves bested Gruumsh, taking

out his enemys eye with a ick of his longsword, elves are

convinced of their innate superiority over the bestial orcs.

Nevertheless, orcs have waged war against elves more than

any other race, and rarely does a confrontation end without

bloody conict. Given this history, most elves harbor neither

trust nor affection for the brutish humanoids, and they

regard the half-breed spawn of their enemies with barely

concealed suspicion. An elf may greet a half-orc pleasantly

enough, but her hand is usually on her sword hilt when she

does so.

Because elves believe strongly in the power of the indi-

vidual to overcome any obstacle, an individual elf is generally

inclined to give an individual half-orc the benet of the doubt.

Few true friendships arise between these races, but a certain

camaraderie is possible.

Humans: The high degree of variety in human culture

fascinates elves, who prize individuality for its own sake. Of

all the humanoid races, humans display the greatest adapt-

ability and exibility as well as a zest for life not seen in most

elven realms. Indeed, these qualities attract elves to humans

so strongly that a relatively large amount of crossbreeding

occurs between the two races.

On the other hand, elves nd humans somewhat unrened

because they simply do not live long enough to acquire the

elves  appreciation  of  the  arts.  Humans  do  not  have  the

long-term perspective that elves possess, a fact that frustrates

elves to no end. Humans often do not care whether the land

can support the spread of their civilization in the long term

because they personally will not be around to witness the

results.  Their  children  or  grandchildren  may  witness  the

decline in fertility of overused land or the gradual altera-

tion of a lake once teeming with sh into a dry hole from

overshing and pollution, but those responsible for it will

be long gone. However, such changes can happen within a

single elfs lifetime, and thus elves feel responsible for being

good stewards of the land.

Humans show a tendency to ght among themselves that

elves nd unsettling at best. A race that preys upon itself to

the extent that humans do is almost beyond comprehension

to the elves; humans seem nearly as bad as orcs in their

capacity for destroying each other over petty issues. Most

races have a long-standing enmity for some other race,

but of all the civilized races only humans slay each other

with abandon.

Nevertheless,  whatever  humanitys  weak  points  may

be, it is still a young race with great potential. Many elves

consider it their duty to guide humans toward a higher

degree of civilization just as they would guide their own

children in the acquisition of knowledge. Thus, many elf

communities treat humans with a degree of indulgence

often reserved for children. Others, recognizing in humans

a great strength and martial prowess, seek to ally with them

on an equal footing, melding the wisdom of elf war leaders

with the skill and ferocity of human troops to create a nearly

unbeatable combination.

Raptorans: Elves share an alphabet and a love of unspoiled

lands with the raptorans, and sometimes the two races

enact mutual defense pacts despite the raptorans territo-

RELIGION

Religion is a deeply personal aspect of an elfs life. All elves

hear the legends of the gods when they are young, and all

are exposed to clerics and rituals from an early age. What

these  traditions  mean  to  an  individual  elf  varies  with  his

own experiences and mind-set.

Organized religious services occur only on holidays and for

special events such as weddings and funerals. Most individu-

als go to temples whenever the mood strikes them, which

may be more or less frequently depending on the individual.

Most temples offer little in the way of education, except in

the tenets of a particular religion, since elves can gain their

education from almost anyone in the community. Offerings

to the church are voluntary, but most temples and shrines

have an embarrassment of riches in the form of services and

artworks donated by grateful members of the community.

Indeed,  many  elf  artisans  look  upon  creating  a  work  to

decorate a temple as the pinnacle of their endeavors.

Clerics of each temple are present for all major festival

days in an elf community. Although their blessings are part

of the ceremonies, these acts are recognized as the clerics

personal contributions more than religious necessities. Elven

weddings usually include a cleric of Hanali Celanil or Corel-

lon Larethian who joins the couple. A proper elven funeral

requires the presence of a cleric of Sehanine Moonbow or

Corellon Larethian to dispose of the remains with a dust

to dust spell and to comfort the mourners with assurances

that the departed has gone to join Corellon and the other

elven deities.

dwelling right away. Most, however, choose to dwell with

an older relative for some time or to go out adventuring for

a few years.

Because of their close association with multiple family

members, elves tend to develop strong bonds with their

families, though their independent nature prevents them

from feeling physically tied to one person or place. Elves often

travel for long periods during their adult lives, then return

with tales to tell their loved ones. Though the absent elves

are missed, their families know they will return eventually

if no misfortune befalls them.

Elderly elves often retire to their own estates within the

community after having lived long and full lives. Most retain

their ties with family and friends until the end. Free of the

ravages of age, elderly elves remain perfectly self-sufcient

until the very end of their days. Elderly elves are honored

by all, and any disrespect to an older elf is considered a seri-

ous breach of etiquette. Because elves retain their mental

acuity throughout their lives, elderly elves are considered

storehouses of knowledge. Many dictate their memoirs to

younger elves to preserve them for posterity.

ELVES AND OTHER RACES

Because of their physical beauty and their generally mild

temperaments,  elves  are  welcomed  by  almost  all  other

sentient beings. They can nd something in common with

most beings they encounter, and they tend to accentuate the

positive in their dealings with other races.

Elf communities often form alliances with nearby humans

and raptorans to the benet of all involved. When war threatens

with any neighboring community, elves always try negotia-

tion rst in hopes of avoiding open conict. Though they do

not negotiate away any of their rights, they do attempt to nd

a solution that will benet both parties. Only in rare cases

do they fail to come to agreement with their enemies.

Dwarves:  Given  the  widely  disparate  outlooks  of  elves

and dwarves, it is no wonder that their diplomatic relations

tend to be difcult. Dwarves subjugate the individual in

favor of the group, and elves do the opposite. Both ways of

life work for the races that embrace them, but this difference

in emphasis makes it difcult for the two groups to agree on

specic plans. Elves tend to see dwarves as dour and lacking

in humor, whereas dwarves nd elves to be ighty, ckle, and

irresponsible, given their apparent lack of focus on family.

Despite their differences, the two races agree on most issues

of importance because both are basically good. Though they

may shout, pout, and hurl insults at one another in the heat

of negotiations, they stand shoulder to shoulder in the face

of outside threats.

Gnomes: Though many gnomes are skilled with arcane

magic, few seem to be serious in pursuit of its secrets. Gnomes

tend to treat magic as nothing more than parlor tricks with

which to confound and amuse companions instead of study-

ing it in depth and wresting its secrets from the cosmos the

way elves do. Of course, gnomes are somewhat shorter-lived

than elves, so they cannot be expected to delve as deeply as

an elf can into any subject. Still, even humans treat magic

with more respect than gnomes do.

Though elves may consider gnomes trivial and somewhat

frivolous, they recognize in them a love of music equal to their

own. Though the music of gnomes varies more in style than

the haunting refrains that characterize elven tunes, gnomes

have developed a degree of artistry with sound unrivaled

by any other race. Gnome bards are always welcome in elf

communities, and some even compete in festivals of the arts

alongside elves.

Halings: Most elves dont quite know what to make

of halings. The little folk seem incredibly charming, and

most elves greatly enjoy their company. On the other hand,

elves often have the sense that halings are holding back

somehowwhich they often are. Halings are somewhat

in awe of elves and tend to be on their best behavior around

them. This reticence on the part of halings to be fully them-

selves often leads elves to consider them somewhat stodgy,

but this impression couldnt be farther from the truth. When

halings spend long periods in the realms of the elves, they

tend to come out of their shells and reveal their fun-loving

nature. However, most halings limit their visits to such

places because of their natural desire to see and do a variety

of things.

Elves value halings ability to t into almost any group and

to charm others into seeing things their way with honeyed

words. They also realize, however, that honeyed words and

sticky ngers frequently go together, so elves rarely invite

halings to visit places that shelter valuable artifacts.  Elves

also respect the halings desire to avoid conictan attitude

they share, though not for the same reasons.

Because of their charming nature, the interesting tales

they tell, and the trade goods they bring, halings are always

welcome in elf communities. Occasionally, elves even seek

the aid of halings for ventures in which their particular

skills would be useful.

Half-Elves: Elves look on half-elves as relatives who are

deserving of welcome in their communities. Many view

them with a touch of pity because their elf blood gives them

such promise, but their human blood condemns them to early

death. Others perceive in them a vibrancy and a zest for life

rarely seen in elves.

Given the elven penchant for individuality, it would be

incorrect to assume that all elves feel the same way about

anything. There are always some who have difculty looking

past a half-elfs heritage, seeing it as impure, inferior, or repug-

nant depending on the circumstances of the childs birth.

Even for those untroubled by a childs non-elf parentage,

it can be difcult to deny the physical differences between

half-elf and elf children. On that basis alone, some elf adults

have difculty hiding their disdain and pity for a child who

cannot compete with his peersa heavy burden for a child

of any race to bear.

Beyond those considerations, elves refuse to categorize

half-elves, according each the respect as an individual that

1

would be the birthright of any full elf. In particular, elves

realize  that  some  half-elves  do  not  share  their  chaotic

viewpoint, though half-elves often understand it better than

members of other races do. For that reason, elves may nd

half-elves to be valuable go-betweens in negotiations with

some lawful-aligned races.

Half-Orcs: The racial enmity between elves and orcs

goes back to the creation of the races and the legendary

battle between Corellon Larethian and Gruumsh, the orc

deity. According to the legend, elves sprang from the drops

of Corellons blood that was shed while the two fought.

Because the Creator of the Elves bested Gruumsh, taking

out his enemys eye with a ick of his longsword, elves are

convinced of their innate superiority over the bestial orcs.

Nevertheless, orcs have waged war against elves more than

any other race, and rarely does a confrontation end without

bloody conict. Given this history, most elves harbor neither

trust nor affection for the brutish humanoids, and they

regard the half-breed spawn of their enemies with barely

concealed suspicion. An elf may greet a half-orc pleasantly

enough, but her hand is usually on her sword hilt when she

does so.

Because elves believe strongly in the power of the indi-

vidual to overcome any obstacle, an individual elf is generally

inclined to give an individual half-orc the benet of the doubt.

Few true friendships arise between these races, but a certain

camaraderie is possible.

Humans: The high degree of variety in human culture

fascinates elves, who prize individuality for its own sake. Of

all the humanoid races, humans display the greatest adapt-

ability and exibility as well as a zest for life not seen in most

elven realms. Indeed, these qualities attract elves to humans

so strongly that a relatively large amount of crossbreeding

occurs between the two races.

On the other hand, elves nd humans somewhat unrened

because they simply do not live long enough to acquire the

elves  appreciation  of  the  arts.  Humans  do  not  have  the

long-term perspective that elves possess, a fact that frustrates

elves to no end. Humans often do not care whether the land

can support the spread of their civilization in the long term

because they personally will not be around to witness the

results.  Their  children  or  grandchildren  may  witness  the

decline in fertility of overused land or the gradual altera-

tion of a lake once teeming with sh into a dry hole from

overshing and pollution, but those responsible for it will

be long gone. However, such changes can happen within a

single elfs lifetime, and thus elves feel responsible for being

good stewards of the land.

Humans show a tendency to ght among themselves that

elves nd unsettling at best. A race that preys upon itself to

the extent that humans do is almost beyond comprehension

to the elves; humans seem nearly as bad as orcs in their

capacity for destroying each other over petty issues. Most

races have a long-standing enmity for some other race,

but of all the civilized races only humans slay each other

with abandon.

Nevertheless,  whatever  humanitys  weak  points  may

be, it is still a young race with great potential. Many elves

consider it their duty to guide humans toward a higher

degree of civilization just as they would guide their own

children in the acquisition of knowledge. Thus, many elf

communities treat humans with a degree of indulgence

often reserved for children. Others, recognizing in humans

a great strength and martial prowess, seek to ally with them

on an equal footing, melding the wisdom of elf war leaders

with the skill and ferocity of human troops to create a nearly

unbeatable combination.

Raptorans: Elves share an alphabet and a love of unspoiled

lands with the raptorans, and sometimes the two races

enact mutual defense pacts despite the raptorans territo-

riality. Individual raptorans and elves tend to get along

well, both bemused by the short-term thinking of humans

and other races.

ALOBAL LORFIRIL

Demigod (Chaotic Good)

Revelry, hedonism, and excess of all kinds are the purview

of Alobal Lorril, known as the Reveler and the Merry Magi-

cian. The youngest of the Seldarine (see Mythic Origins, page

25), he urges his followers to wrest the maximum possible

pleasure from each moment. Responsibility is for tomorrow;

why  not  spend  today  enjoying  good  food,  ne

wine, friendship, and love?

Alobal  does  not  cajole  his  followers  to

become intoxicated to the point of causing harm

to themselves or others, nor does he condone

seeking personal pleasure at the expense

of  others.  He  teaches  that  there  is  as

much potential in tomorrow as there

is in today, and that elves need never

hurry. Wasting today in drudgery is

fruitless and possibly sinful.

Appearing  as  a  comely  male  elf

with eyes of sparkling gold, the Merry

Magician  enjoys  magic  used  to  provide

amusement, to create beauty, or to enhance

the  pleasure  of  ordinary  activities.  Illusions

used  for  enjoyment  rather  than  base  trickery

are  common  among  his  followers,  as  are  trans-

mutations geared toward improving artworks and

conjurations aimed at gaining an amusing compan-

ion for a short period.

Portfolio: Hedonism, mirth, magic, revelry.

Domains: Chaos, Good, Magic, Trickery.

Cleric Training: Alobals clerics begin their training

by hosting spontaneous revels and magic shows in their

communities. As they gain in power and importance, they

preside  at  community  functions,  provide  entertainment

to lift the spirits of the sick and injured, and oversee the

production of wine, sweetmeats, and other fare consumed

purely for pleasure.

Quests:  The  Revelers  followers  typically  undertake

quests to retrieve items of beauty that give pleasure to those

who own them, seek out magic wines and rare foods,

compete in games, and establish magical means

of reducing the average elfs daily workload.

Such quests often involve consultation

with other long-lived creatures, such

as good-aligned dragons, about what

gives  them  the  greatest  pleasure

and satisfaction.

Prayers: Prayers to Alobal often

frame  requests  in  terms  of  plea-

sure.  Let  me  lift  the  mantle  of

care  from  my  compatriots/With  a

glass, a wink, a song,/And keep them

laughing the whole night long, goes one

common prayer.

Shrines: Alobals followers rarely establish temples; most

lack the fortitude to work so hard. They often create small

shrines in taverns, glades, and places of wild beauty. A shrine

to  Alobal  usually  conceals  ample  stores  of  wine,  sugared

fruits, and other confections as well as scrolls of spells that

followers commonly use. Alobals shrines are often masked

by magic, appearing as trees with rainbow-colored leaves or

other odd but pleasing objects.

Rites: The worshipers of Alobal revere their

god  every  time  they  take  a  sip  of  wine,  taste  a

delectable food, swap tales with a friend,

or  participate  in  an  enjoyable  activity.

Merely invoking the gods name at such

times counts as veneration of the deity.

Herald and Allies: An elf 10th-level

illusionist/10th-level  rogue  is  Alobals

herald on the Material Plane. His allies are

bralani eladrins, lillends or ghaele eladrins,

and planetars.

Favored Weapon: Dagger.

CORELLON LARETHIAN

Greater God (Chaotic Good)

Corellon Larethian is described in Chapter 6

of the Players Handbook. The Creator of the Elves

governs all things dear to the elven soulmagic,

music, arts, crafts, beauty, self-reliance, and poetry. He

also represents warfare in a just cause. His nemesis is

Gruumsh, the deity of the orcs, who once lost an eye

to Corellons ashing blade.

Portfolio: Elves, magic, music, arts.

Domains: Chaos, Good, Protection, War.

Cleric Training: Because elves are so long-lived, Corellons

clerics can afford to spend years observing potential recruits

before initiating them into the mysteries of the faith. Once a

new cleric-to-be accepts an invitation to join the clergy, she

spends much time in meditation, quiet academic study, and

artistic endeavors.

Quests: Corellon wants to protect the elven people from

harm. Beyond that, he wants to return to them the lost artistic

masterpieces of their heritage, and he tries to thwart

the drow at every opportunity. Corellons follow-

ers nd themselves protecting villages from

gnoll incursions, stealing into evil temples

to recover ancient elven tomes of lore, and

destroying underground fortresses full

of vampiric drow clerics.

Prayers: Corellons prayers are always

in Elven. They often begin with Hei-

Corollon  shar-shelevu,  which  means

Corellon, may your grace grant . . .

Temples: In an elf city, the temple to

Corellon Larethian is often an alabaster

wonder  of  minarets  and  parapets.  In

smaller  communities,  the  temple  often

takes the form of a massive tree house hundreds

of Deep Sashelas

Shrines: Most shrines to the Dolphin Prince are built

on  the  sea  oor  or  on  the  faces  of  rocky  cliffs,  though

some  can  be  found  on  barren  coastlines.

Built  of  shells,  coral,  and  driftwood,  they

are  festooned  with  artistic  creations  of  the

elves. A pool of crystal-clear water serves as

the altar.

Rites: The clerics of Deep Sashelas hold

rites at especially high and low tides, known

as  High  Flow  and  Deep  Ebb.  Offerings

of precious items from the sea and great

works  of  art  are  made  during  these  cer-

emonies, and his clerics hold water dances

that  involve  swimming  in  prescribed

patterns with dolphins and singing songs

reminiscent of the crashing of waves upon

the shore.

Herald and Allies: A 20th-level celestial

aquatic elf cleric serves as Deep Sashelass herald.

His  allies  include  tritons,  celestial  orcas,  and

advanced celestial cachalot whales. (Deep Sashelas

often sends magical beasts as planar allies, contrary

to the spell description.)

Favored Weapon: Trident.

ELEBRIN LIOTHIEL

Intermediate God (Chaotic Good)

Known as the Celestial Gardener, Elebrin Liothiel is the

elven god of orchards, gardens, and the harvest. This pastoral

deity represents the abundance of nature and its ability to

provide for those who live in harmony with it.

Elebrin appears as a young male elf dressed in tunic and

breeches in muted gold shades. His cloak is the color

of green spring leaves embroidered with trailing vines,

and he carries a sturdy staff made of rowan wood.

A circlet of leafy vines adorns his brow.

The Celestial Gardener created the saelas

tree as a gift to the elves, and he bestows spe-

cial care on saelas groves. (The Elven word

saelas translates as wildwood in Common;

for  information  about  the  properties

of  wildwood,  see  page  169.)  In  addition,

Elebrin watches over the gardens, orchards,

and groves near elf settlements, ensuring

abundant harvests for those who plant and

tend  in  tune  with  nature.  Ornamental

gardens are also within his purview, as are

any other decorative plantings.

of feet above the forest oor. Most temples are eager to aid

traveling elves in any way they canand other races as well if

theyre ghting the hated drow. Corellons temples often

double as armories in smaller cities.

Rites:  Corellons  rites  are  integrated

with elf society, celebrating births, honoring

deceased  believers,  and  blessing  marriages.

Before  a  battle,  believers  often  recite  the

Litany of the Arrows.

Herald and Allies: Corellon uses 20th-

level celestial elf clerics as his heralds.

These  individuals  are  always  consum-

mate archers. His allies include bralani

eladrins, ghaele eladrins, and planetars.

Favored Weapon: Longsword.

DEEP SASHELAS

Intermediate God (Chaotic Good)

The Lord of the Undersea is the patron of aquatic

elves. With his consort Trishinia, Queen of the

Dolphins, he rules the world beneath the waves and

creates ever-changing vistas of undersea beauty.

Deep  Sashelas  appears  as  a  handsome  aquatic

elf  with  sea-green  skin  and  owing  blue-green

hair. He is usually clad in leather armor made of

sharkskin and decorated with ns and frills. Deep Sashelas

is  a  charismatic  leader  and  an  inspired  creator,  but  he  is

also ckle and ighty, as evidenced by the many tales of his

amorous  adventures  with  mermaids,  mortal  aquatic  elves,

and other lovely beings of the deep.

Portfolio: Oceans, aquatic elves, creation, knowledge.

Domains: Chaos, Good, Protection, Water.

Cleric  Training:  The  clerics  of

Deep Sashelas are mostly aquatic elves,

though surface elves also venerate him.

All his clerics can swim, and they often act

as mediators between aquatic and nonaquatic

races. They oppose the sahuagin and often

take the battle directly to their enemies.

Quests:  Followers  of  Deep  Sashelas

often  undertake  quests  to  retrieve  magic

items  that  control  aquatic  creatures,  to

attack sahuagin strongholds, or to estab-

lish  alliances  between  elves  and  other

races, both above and below the water.

Prayers: The followers of the Dolphin

Prince pray to him upon beginning new

artistic projects and upon completing them,

and when they are girding themselves for war

against  enemies  of  the  aquatic  elves.  Prayers

to  Deep  Sashelas  always  invoke  the  beauty  of

the  undersea  world  and  often  ask  for  guidance  in

preserving it. Lord of the Undersea, keep my resolve

as strong as the tides and my weapon-arm as swift

as the eel, that I may preserve the grandeur of the

realm below the waves, goes one common prayer.

Portfolio:  Nature,  gardens,  orchards,

harvest.

Domains: Chaos, Good, Plant, Sun.

Cleric Training: Clerics of Elebrin tend the

communal  gardens  and  orchards  of  an  elf  settle-

ment, studying how to plant crops to harmonize

with  nature  rather  than  compete  with  other

native  growth.  As  they  gain  experience,  they

elves. A pool of crystal-clear water serves as

the altar.

Intermediate God (Chaotic Good)

breeches in muted gold shades. His cloak is the color

of green spring leaves embroidered with trailing vines,

and he carries a sturdy staff made of rowan wood.

A circlet of leafy vines adorns his brow.

The Celestial Gardener created the saelas

tree as a gift to the elves, and he bestows spe-

cial care on saelas groves. (The Elven word

saelas translates as wildwood in Common;

for  information  about  the  properties

of  wildwood,  see  page  169.)  In  addition,

Elebrin watches over the gardens, orchards,

and groves near elf settlements, ensuring

abundant harvests for those who plant and

tend  in  tune  with  nature.  Ornamental

gardens are also within his purview, as are

any other decorative plantings.

deceased  believers,  and  blessing  marriages.

Before  a  battle,  believers  often  recite  the

Litany of the Arrows.

Dolphins, he rules the world beneath the waves and

creates ever-changing vistas of undersea beauty.

Deep  Sashelas  appears  as  a  handsome  aquatic

elf  with  sea-green  skin  and  owing  blue-green

hair. He is usually clad in leather armor made of

sharkskin and decorated with ns and frills. Deep Sashelas

is  a  charismatic  leader  and  an  inspired  creator,  but  he  is

also ckle and ighty, as evidenced by the many tales of his

amorous  adventures  with  mermaids,  mortal  aquatic  elves,

and other lovely beings of the deep.

Portfolio: Oceans, aquatic elves, creation, knowledge.

Domains: Chaos, Good, Protection, Water.

Cleric  Training:  The  clerics  of

Deep Sashelas are mostly aquatic elves,

though surface elves also venerate him.

All his clerics can swim, and they often act

as mediators between aquatic and nonaquatic

races. They oppose the sahuagin and often

take the battle directly to their enemies.

Quests:  Followers  of  Deep  Sashelas

often  undertake  quests  to  retrieve  magic

items  that  control  aquatic  creatures,  to

attack sahuagin strongholds, or to estab-

lish  alliances  between  elves  and  other

races, both above and below the water.

Prayers: The followers of the Dolphin

Prince pray to him upon beginning new

artistic projects and upon completing them,

and when they are girding themselves for war

against  enemies  of  the  aquatic  elves.  Prayers

to  Deep  Sashelas  always  invoke  the  beauty  of

the  undersea  world  and  often  ask  for  guidance  in

preserving it. Lord of the Undersea, keep my resolve

as strong as the tides and my weapon-arm as swift

as the eel, that I may preserve the grandeur of the

realm below the waves, goes one common prayer.

Portfolio:  Nature,  gardens,  orchards,

harvest.

Domains: Chaos, Good, Plant, Sun.

Cleric Training: Clerics of Elebrin tend the

communal  gardens  and  orchards  of  an  elf  settle-

or some other misfortune.

Prayers: Prayers to the Celestial Gardener usually involve

the health of forests and other plant life or requests for rain,

sun,  or  other  needed  weather  conditions.  Whatever  their

content, the elf offering them always has a piece of saelas or

a living plant close at hand. Elves often go to saelas groves

or orchards to offer their prayers to Elebrin.

Shrines: Elebrins shrines are usually

simple  platforms  built  in  tall  trees,

though  some  are  one-room  domed

or  peaked  buildings  shaped  entirely

of saelas. Each has a dirt floor from

which neatly tended plants of every

kind grow in profusion everywhere

aside  from  a  few  cleared  paths  to  the

altar. Offerings of saelas weapons, armor,

and tools are frequently cached near the

altar.

bless new plantings, forests where new elf com-

munities will be built, and harvests gathered from

both tended gardens and wild forests.

Lolthu, which means Test me, Lolth.

particularly worthy followers. Those who succeed at these

ritesmost of which involve competitive spellcasting or

all-out combatgain access to more powerful magic.

Those who fail are demoted, killed, or turned

VANDRIA GILMADRITH

Intermediate Goddess (Lawful Neutral)

War is never desirable, but sometimes it is necessary.

When armed con ict is unavoidable, elves pray to Vandria

23

Gilmadrith for prudent strategy and for victory with minimal

loss of life.

The daughter of Corellon Larethian by his original consort

Araushnee, Vandria was once as carefree and high-spirited

as any other member of the Seldarine (see Mythic Origins,

page 25). However, when Araushnee led a treacherous assault

on  the  Seldarine,  Vandria  gathered  forces  to  defend  the

other  elf  deities.  The  resulting  carnage  forever  sobered

her and cemented her commitment to aiding

her people at times when taking up arms

becomes inevitable.

Like  Corellon  Larethian,  Vandria

Gilmadrith is a war deity, but where Corel-

lon  epitomizes  the  glory  of  individual

combat, Vandria embodies strategy, tactics,

alliances,  and  close  cooperation  on  the

battleeld. Such innately lawful aspects

of war are alien to the chaotic soul of

the elf, so Vandria normally has few

followers among the elf race. Still,

even  elves  must  sometimes  learn

to  work  together  for  the  greater

good, and her worship blossoms as

never before when war looms on the

horizon.  Known  as  Steelheart  for

her steady nature and steadfast pro-

tection,  Vandria  represents  the  ability

of the elves to harden their carefree hearts

and band together in times of trouble.

Vandria  appears  as  a  middle-aged  female

elf  with  white  hair  bound  in  a  severe  braid,

bearing an expression of grim and sorrowful resignation. A

pair of feathered, steel-gray wings sprouts from her back,

and an ornate silver helm with no visor protects her head.

Her elven chain gleams with a radiant light, and she wields

a longbow and a greatsword in combat.

Vandria feels the death of every elf who perishes on the

battleeld,  the  pain  of  every  elf  maimed  in  combat,  and

the grief of all those who lose loved ones to war. Thus, her

primary interest is in preventing war and in shortening it

when it becomes necessary. Ever vigilant, she keeps watch

for  dangers  that  threaten  the  elf  race.  On  the  battleeld,

elves sometimes claim to see her folding her wings around

a threatened unit to protect it, or pointing out a hidden foe.

As the only lawful-aligned deity in the elven pantheon,

Vandria holds sway over laws, contracts, alliances, and all

other types of formal agreements. Elders weighing judgment

in disagreements always invoke her and pray for the wisdom

to  dispense  punishments  fairly.  Elves  who  need  to  make

critical decisions sometimes seek her counsel when faced

with a difcult choice.

Because of the sorrow she feels when war claims her people,

Vandria Gilmadrith is also known as the Lady of Grief. All

those who grieve, whether through losses from violence or

through the normal passage of time, pray to her for solace.

Portfolio: War, guardianship, justice, grief, vigilance,

decision.

Domains: Law, Protection, War.

Special:  Vandria  does  not  accept  evil  clerics.  Her

clerics  can  be  neutral,  lawful  neutral,  lawful  good,  or

neutral good.

Cleric Training: Clerics of Vandria Gilmadrith begin

their training by serving in the watch, sitting with elders

while they hear disputes, learning about the

traditional enemies of the elves, and serv-

ing as singers at funerals. As they advance,

they may lead watch patrols, serve as seconds

for aggrieved parties bringing cases before

the elders, help to shore up a communitys

defenses, and assist the master of arms

in training young elves with weap-

onry. When war threatens, clerics

of Vandria help the ruler form alli-

ances  and  plan  strategy.  They  also

instruct  elf  warriors  in  close  com-

bat techniques. As they are prone to

telling warriors who tend toward too

much  independence  on  the  battle-

eld, A wave of arrows is better than

a lot of single bowshots. After a battle,

clerics of Vandria retrieve the dead from the

battleeld.

Quests:  Vandrias  quests  often  require

adventurers  to  visit  rulers  of  other  lands  on

diplomatic missions, to hunt down lawbreakers,

retrieve stolen property, or to gather information

critical to preventing or winning a war.

Prayers:  Because  Vandria  prefers  defense  to  offense,

prayers to her often take the form of promises to defend

others. Let not my arm falter, goes one common prayer,

lest the lives in my care be forfeit. A prayer for aid in judg-

ment or help in making a decision might be expressed as Let

my eyes see clearly and my heart be as steel.

Shrines:  Temples  to  Steelheart  are  usually  hidden  for-

tresses whose locations are known only to her worshipers and

clergy. Situated in defensible caves, beneath huge trees, or

in hidden vales, Vandrias temples are stocked with weapons

and supplies so that they can double as last retreats for the

entire community. A few of her shrines are little more than

simple tree houses situated at key vantage points so that her

clerics can spot trouble on the horizon.

Rites: Vandrias clerics bless alliances and seal contracts.

They also bless troops going into battle and lead memorial

services for those whose bodies could not be retrieved from

the battleeld.

Herald and Allies: A celestial elf 10th-level ghter/10th-

level wildrunner (see page 139) serves as Vandrias herald

on the Material Plane. Her allies are formian taskmasters,

formian myrmarchs, and hound archon heroes.

Favored Weapon: Longbow.

ELF HISTORY

AND FOLKLORE

The elves claim to be the rst mortal race in the world, and

they are probably right. They certainly had complex civiliza-

tions long before humankind walked the earth, and they may

even have tamed the forest primeval, as some of their legends

claim. Though they do not feel tied to any single place and

may abandon a city when the site no longer suits their needs,

a few of their cities have reportedly existed almost since the

dawn  of  timeand  no  one  can  prove  otherwise.  Though

specic  customs  may  change  over

time,  elven  culture  remains

among  the  richest  that  any

race can boast.

No one knows exact-

ly when the first elves

set  foot  on  the  floor

of the first forest, but

legend  holds  that  the

elves arose in the after-

math of a divine battle

between  two  power-

ful  gods.  Whether  or

not this tale and other

legends  handed  down

from  parent  to  child

are true, they explain

much  about  why  the

elven soul treasures free-

dom above all else, how

the elven style of com-

bat  evolved,  and  how

the  elves  came  to  pos-

sess  their  afnity  for

magic and nature.

Roleplaying  Ap-

plication:  Though

elves are not creatures

of tradition, their leg-

ends  are  still  part  of

their  racial  identity.

What  is  your  characters

favorite legend? Is there a leg-

endary  character  that  inspires

her? Does she plan to create new legends of her own, based

on her personal exploits?

MYTHIC ORIGINS

In  the  time  before  time,  the  gods  sprang  fully  formed

from the primeval void. All these rst gods were equally

endowed with the power of the cosmos, and each claimed

jurisdiction over certain aspects of the universe. In a spirit

of cooperation that has not been seen since, they built the

worlds together, separating matter from energy, land from

sea, and sky from earth.

The  wiser  gods  banded  together  and  called  themselves

the Seldarine, or Brothers and Sisters of the Wood. While

the other gods squabbled over custody of the various aspects

of the worlds they had jointly created, the Seldarine used

their power to cover the barren lands of the world with lush

forests, tall grasses, owers of incredible beauty, and animals

of every kind. Moradin, Yondalla, and Garl Glittergold allied

with  the  Seldarine,  claiming  the  mountains,  plains,  hills,

and underground areas of the new world as their own. When

Gruumsh, the evil god who later fathered the orc race, realized

that there was no good portion of the world left for him, he

grew black with rage. Seizing

the caves, rocky cliffs, and

sections of the darkness

below that no one else

wanted,  he  began  to

plot his revenge.

Gruumsh  decid-

ed to build for himself

a  magnicent  fortress

directly  on  the  sur-

face of the world that

the  other  gods  had

claimed. One by one,

he  tore  out  of  the

ground the towering

trees  that  graced  the

forests.  One  by  one,

he  stripped  them  of

their branches and laid

them atop one another

to  build  a  vast,  crude

structure to house the

armies  he  intended

to  create.  Gruumsh

cleared  miles  upon

miles  of  forested  land

in this way, leaving be-

hind  barren  deserts

upon  which  nothing

would  grow.  Corellon

Larethian, lord and cre-

ator  of  the  earths  vast

forests,  ordered  him  to  cease

and the orc gods reply was to seize

Araushnee, a darkly beautiful goddess who was Corellons

consort, and imprison her within his crude fortress.

Corellon  would  not  be  goaded  so  easily  into  fury.

Choosing a tall, perfect tree, he fashioned its trunk into a

magnicent longbow and made from its branches a set of

true-ying arrows. From atop a mountain many miles away

he nocked an arrow to his bow and red upon Gruumshs

fortress. Again and again he red, and each of his arrows

ew through some chink between the logs and found its

mark, piercing the orc gods body until his blood ran like

a river, undermining the sandy base upon which he had

Gruumsh runs from a hail of arrows

Gilmadrith for prudent strategy and for victory with minimal

loss of life.

The daughter of Corellon Larethian by his original consort

Araushnee, Vandria was once as carefree and high-spirited

as any other member of the Seldarine (see Mythic Origins,

page 25). However, when Araushnee led a treacherous assault

on  the  Seldarine,  Vandria  gathered  forces  to  defend  the

other  elf  deities.  The  resulting  carnage  forever  sobered

her and cemented her commitment to aiding

her people at times when taking up arms

becomes inevitable.

Like  Corellon  Larethian,  Vandria

Gilmadrith is a war deity, but where Corel-

lon  epitomizes  the  glory  of  individual

combat, Vandria embodies strategy, tactics,

alliances,  and  close  cooperation  on  the

battleeld. Such innately lawful aspects

of war are alien to the chaotic soul of

the elf, so Vandria normally has few

followers among the elf race. Still,

even  elves  must  sometimes  learn

to  work  together  for  the  greater

good, and her worship blossoms as

never before when war looms on the

horizon.  Known  as  Steelheart  for

her steady nature and steadfast pro-

tection,  Vandria  represents  the  ability

of the elves to harden their carefree hearts

and band together in times of trouble.

Vandria  appears  as  a  middle-aged  female

elf  with  white  hair  bound  in  a  severe  braid,

bearing an expression of grim and sorrowful resignation. A

pair of feathered, steel-gray wings sprouts from her back,

and an ornate silver helm with no visor protects her head.

Her elven chain gleams with a radiant light, and she wields

a longbow and a greatsword in combat.

Vandria feels the death of every elf who perishes on the

battleeld,  the  pain  of  every  elf  maimed  in  combat,  and

the grief of all those who lose loved ones to war. Thus, her

primary interest is in preventing war and in shortening it

when it becomes necessary. Ever vigilant, she keeps watch

for  dangers  that  threaten  the  elf  race.  On  the  battleeld,

elves sometimes claim to see her folding her wings around

a threatened unit to protect it, or pointing out a hidden foe.

As the only lawful-aligned deity in the elven pantheon,

Vandria holds sway over laws, contracts, alliances, and all

other types of formal agreements. Elders weighing judgment

in disagreements always invoke her and pray for the wisdom

to  dispense  punishments  fairly.  Elves  who  need  to  make

critical decisions sometimes seek her counsel when faced

with a difcult choice.

Because of the sorrow she feels when war claims her people,

Vandria Gilmadrith is also known as the Lady of Grief. All

those who grieve, whether through losses from violence or

through the normal passage of time, pray to her for solace.

Portfolio: War, guardianship, justice, grief, vigilance,

decision.

Domains: Law, Protection, War.

Special:  Vandria  does  not  accept  evil  clerics.  Her

clerics  can  be  neutral,  lawful  neutral,  lawful  good,  or

built. Down crashed the fortress around Gruumshs ears,

allowing Araushnee to escape.

Enraged, Gruumsh seized his morningstar and ran across

the land to confront his enemy, all the while with Corellons

arrows raining down upon him. The two gods clashed with a

fury that rocked the newly born world. Furiously they fought

for a day and a night. Araushnee, who hoped that Corellons

death might give her the opportunity to rise as queen over the

Seldarine, secretly aided the orc god. Other gods joined the

ght on both sides, and re rained down from the heavens.

On and on went the divine battle thereafter known as the

First War.

At last, the other gods began to withdraw, their strength

and their fury spent. Gruumsh and Corellon fought on, the

orc lords power waxing in the dark of night while Corel-

lon gained in strength during the day. At last, Gruumshs

greater physical strength and endurance began to prevail

over Corellons dancing blade, and the orc god pressed his

advantage. Corellon turned his stricken, bleeding face to

the sky, and the tears of Sehanine Moonbow, another of

the Seldarine, fell upon it, giving him the strength for a

final strike. Turning back to his foe, Corellon plucked out

Gruumshs eye with a single, well-placed sword stroke.

The orc lord howled with pain and ran from the field of

battle.  Known  as  One-Eye  forever  after,  he  nurses  his

hatred of the Seldarine in the dark recesses of the world,

plotting revenge.

Corellon gathered up the soil that had soaked up his blood

and Sehanines tears and formed it into mortal beings of

unearthly beauty, which he called elves. Corellon fashioned

elves in the image of each member of the Seldarine, then

set them upon the earth to be its stewards. Infused with the

divine power of gods blood and tears, the elves took control

of earths forested lands, seas, and skies.

Araushnees treachery did not go unpunished. For her

betrayal, Araushnee was cast out of the Seldarine and trans-

formed into a demonic spider-form. Renaming herself Lolth,

she called to the elves created in her image, the drow, and

retreated with them beneath the earth. Sehanine Moonbow,

whose tears had given Corellon strength in his time of need

and whose silver light had revealed Araushnees evil, became

Corellons new consort.

Seeing the creations of the Seldarine, the other gods

scrambled to emulate them. However, their hurry was too

great, and each of their creations was but a awed, forlorn

imitation of the magnicent elves. Because of these aws, the

other races could not live as long as elves or reach the same

heights of civilization. Still, the elves were kind to those races

that had good hearts and helped them to establish themselves.

The orcs, however, seek always to avenge themselves on the

elves for their gods mutilation, and the two races have nursed

a deep-seated enmity ever since.

LEGENDS

Elves do not have as many legends as dwarves, gnomes, and

halings do, but the ones they do espouse are carefully pre-

26

served and passed on from one generation to the next. Since

elves have longer lives than the other mortal races, their tales

have passed through fewer generations; thus, they remain

closer to the truth than the tales of other folk, which are

discounted by the elves as mere myth.

Elves have raised storytelling to a high art, and nearly

everyone, not just bards and troubadours, practices it. Many

young elves aspire to the kinds of heroism described in the

stories, but most simply enjoy listening to their fellows spin

tales under the stars.

Many elven tales tell of heroes, magical might, and great

deeds of old. A few are cautionary tales told to keep young

elves from acting too rashly or trusting too easily. Most elves

learn all the classic tales of their race before they reach the

age of 50, but new heroes are always making new legends to

tell under the stars.

The following are some of the most popular elven legends

ever told. Elves consider them all true, as far they know.

The Apples of Ephinia

Long,  long  ago,  there  lived  an  elf  named  Ephinia  who

loved both the natural world and arcane magic. Over the

centuries, her talents for nurturing growing things and for

creating new spells grew until she was the most celebrated

elf in her city. Her gardens were places of wild beauty where

the loveliest owers grew in profusion and the earth gave

forth the most delectable fruits seemingly at her command.

Everyone knew that her plants were touched with magic,

because who else but she could grow lilies edged in silver,

nuts of every hue, and sunowers that sang songs to the sky?

Some in her city said that her gardens were unnatural, but

most saw her achievements as a perfect melding of nature

and magic.

In the prime of her life, Ephinia achieved her greatest

work: a tree that bore apples made of ruby. The tree became

the centerpiece of her garden, and Ephinia was acclaimed

as queen for her magical prowess. The elf city prospered

under her wise guidance, and all was well for the next two

hundred years.

At  last,  however,  the  city  fell  on  hard  times.  A  great

green dragon moved into the nearby forest, and its preda-

tions drove game from the area and poisoned the land.

Orcs came in the dragons wake and began to drive away

the  friendly  humanoids  with  whom  the  elves  traded.

Ephinia created a magic shield over the city to keep out

nonelves, and her magic kept her people fed, though the

city was isolated from all other races. Several elves went

forth to slay the dragon in hopes of freeing their city, but

none returned.

Then a strange young elf calling himself Ervadrith arrived

in the city, claiming to be a great-nephew of one of the elders.

He said that his parents had been slain by the green dragon

while accompanying him here. He was taken in for foster-

ing despite the lack of a family member to present him

properly. Ervadrith showed a keen interest in gardening, and

eventually he earned the right to tend the queens garden

along with her son Hionyron, who was the guardian of

nature for the city.

A few days later, Hionyron was found dead beside a crater

where the precious apple tree once stood. Ervadrith and the

tree were gone. Gone too was the magic shield that protected

the city, as became all too clear when the green dragon ew

overhead and attacked. Ephinia and her people put up a brave

ght, but most of the populace was slain and the city reduced

to ruins. Ephinia herself disappeared, never to be seen again.

All that remained of her garden was a single weeping willow

sapling with blackened fronds.

The surviving elves went forth to discover what had hap-

pened. In their travels through the now-twisted land, they

discovered no trace of ruby apples, and no evidence that

an elf named Ervadrith had ever existed, even when they

traveled to the town from which he claimed to have come.

Not until a brave elf named Fermandor ventured below the

surface with a band of human and dwarf adventurers was the

mystery solved, for they found a grand drow city with a ruby

apple embedded in each of its gates.

Piecing together the tale took quite some time, but even-

tually the brave band discovered that Ervadrith had been

a drow, magically altered to resemble a surface-dwelling

elf. The green dragon had seen the tree glittering from the

queens courtyard when he ew above and coveted the unique

treasure for his hoard. Unable to penetrate the citys defenses,

he made a deal with a band of drow passing through the area

on an exploratory mission: Retrieve the tree for him and

defeat the magic shield, and he would raze the city of their

hated rivals to the ground.

The drow agreed, and the altered Ervadrith passed easily

through the citys wards, which did not prevent the passage

of dark elves. Biding his time, Ervadrith brewed a poison

with which to slay the guardian of nature and prepared a

special pot in which to transport the tree. After slaying

Hionyron, he plucked two apples from the tree and pocketed

them, then used arcane magic to reduce the tree to the size

of a ower, which he potted. Before slipping out into the

night, he stabbed Ephinia while she was in her trance, thus

negating the shield that her own essence had powered. After

delivering the tree to the dragon, he demanded fulllment

of their bargain.

The elves tried to retrieve the apple tree, but the dragon

was too powerful, and all but one of them were slain. The sole

survivor of Ephinias city now roams the world in search of

companions who can help her slay the dragon and retrieve

the tree.

Adventure Hook: The sole survivor of the lost elf city

entreats the PCs to help her slay the green dragon, now grown

to ancient age. The creatures hoard has been enriched with

many ruby apples, but the tree died long ago because the

dragon could not sustain it in the poisonous swamp that was

its home. A tall, graceful weeping willow towers above the

ruins of the old elf city, and any elf who pauses for a trance

beneath it hears the voice of Ephinia, mourning her son and

her city.

Alain and Alarin, the Giant-Killers

Long ago, in an elf community at the edge of a great forest,

twin sons were born to an elf named Melissina. Children are

always looked upon as a gift in an elf community, and twins

are rare enough to be considered blessings of the gods. The

boys were named Alain and Alarin, and they soon became

the darlings of the whole town.

The two boys grew up wiry, lithe, and daring as only young

elves can be. The community looked upon their childish antics

with bemusement, and everyone indulged the twoexcept

their younger cousin Maeve, whose weapon skills were

deplorable. Maeve was jealous of the twins, and she sought

any excuse to belittle their achievements and get them into

trouble with the elders. She had little chance to do the former,

however, since both boys excelled at whatever they tried.

They were particularly skilled with the bow, and they soon

joined the community watch, insisting upon assignment to

the same patrol.

Maeve knew that the boys could not resist a mystery, so she

took pains to draw them away from their compatriots while

they were on watch, hoping they would encounter trouble

they couldnt handle, or at worst draw reprimands from the

captain of the watch.

One day, Maeve carefully laid a trail of footprints leading to

a small patch of quicksand she had discovered near the edge

of a marsh. Sure enough, the boys spotted it and broke off

from the group to follow. Instead of falling into the quicksand

themselves, they arrived just in time to rescue a human who

had blundered into the quicksand from the other direction.

The human turned out to be a kings son, and he pledged

friendship to the elf community and sent gifts to the town

in gratitude.

Another time, Maeve spread the rumor of a whispering

tree near the edge of a high cliff. The route that her cousins

took to investigate led them past a dryad whose tree was

being hacked apart by orcs. The two drove the evil humanoids

away and called for the guardian of nature to mend the tree,

making yet another valuable friend for the community.

Finally, Maeve saw her chance to be rid of her troublesome

cousins once and for all. While gathering mosses for her

aunts garden in a small valley, she chanced to see two hill

giants inspecting a cave in a hillside. As she watched, the

two settled into the cave and began foraging for food. Noting

their movements, she circled the area until she caught sight

of a small band of orcs hunting game. Following them at a

discreet distance, she picked up a broken spearhead, pock-

eted it, and planted it on the trail between the town and the

giants new lair.

Upon returning to town, she told the watch captain that

a small orc patrol was marauding in the hills. The captain

dispatched the twins patrol and, as Maeve had predicted, the

two young elves spotted the broken spearhead and went off

alone in search of the orcs. What they found were two hungry

hill giants already headed in the direction of the elves town.

They took cover quickly in the underbrush on either side of

the trail, but the giants had already spotted Alain. Come

fury that rocked the newly born world. Furiously they fought

for a day and a night. Araushnee, who hoped that Corellons

death might give her the opportunity to rise as queen over the

Seldarine, secretly aided the orc god. Other gods joined the

ght on both sides, and re rained down from the heavens.

On and on went the divine battle thereafter known as the

First War.

At last, the other gods began to withdraw, their strength

and their fury spent. Gruumsh and Corellon fought on, the

orc lords power waxing in the dark of night while Corel-

lon gained in strength during the day. At last, Gruumshs

greater physical strength and endurance began to prevail

over Corellons dancing blade, and the orc god pressed his

advantage. Corellon turned his stricken, bleeding face to

the sky, and the tears of Sehanine Moonbow, another of

the Seldarine, fell upon it, giving him the strength for a

final strike. Turning back to his foe, Corellon plucked out

Gruumshs eye with a single, well-placed sword stroke.

The orc lord howled with pain and ran from the field of

battle.  Known  as  One-Eye  forever  after,  he  nurses  his

hatred of the Seldarine in the dark recesses of the world,

plotting revenge.

Corellon gathered up the soil that had soaked up his blood

and Sehanines tears and formed it into mortal beings of

unearthly beauty, which he called elves. Corellon fashioned

elves in the image of each member of the Seldarine, then

set them upon the earth to be its stewards. Infused with the

divine power of gods blood and tears, the elves took control

of earths forested lands, seas, and skies.

Araushnees treachery did not go unpunished. For her

betrayal, Araushnee was cast out of the Seldarine and trans-

formed into a demonic spider-form. Renaming herself Lolth,

she called to the elves created in her image, the drow, and

retreated with them beneath the earth. Sehanine Moonbow,

whose tears had given Corellon strength in his time of need

and whose silver light had revealed Araushnees evil, became

Corellons new consort.

Seeing the creations of the Seldarine, the other gods

scrambled to emulate them. However, their hurry was too

great, and each of their creations was but a awed, forlorn

imitation of the magnicent elves. Because of these aws, the

other races could not live as long as elves or reach the same

heights of civilization. Still, the elves were kind to those races

that had good hearts and helped them to establish themselves.

The orcs, however, seek always to avenge themselves on the

elves for their gods mutilation, and the two races have nursed

a deep-seated enmity ever since.

LEGENDS

Elves do not have as many legends as dwarves, gnomes, and

halings do, but the ones they do espouse are carefully pre-

26

served and passed on from one generation to the next. Since

elves have longer lives than the other mortal races, their tales

have passed through fewer generations; thus, they remain

closer to the truth than the tales of other folk, which are

discounted by the elves as mere myth.

Elves have raised storytelling to a high art, and nearly

everyone, not just bards and troubadours, practices it. Many

young elves aspire to the kinds of heroism described in the

stories, but most simply enjoy listening to their fellows spin

tales under the stars.

Many elven tales tell of heroes, magical might, and great

deeds of old. A few are cautionary tales told to keep young

elves from acting too rashly or trusting too easily. Most elves

learn all the classic tales of their race before they reach the

age of 50, but new heroes are always making new legends to

tell under the stars.

The following are some of the most popular elven legends

ever told. Elves consider them all true, as far they know.

The Apples of Ephinia

Long,  long  ago,  there  lived  an  elf  named  Ephinia  who

loved both the natural world and arcane magic. Over the

centuries, her talents for nurturing growing things and for

creating new spells grew until she was the most celebrated

elf in her city. Her gardens were places of wild beauty where

the loveliest owers grew in profusion and the earth gave

forth the most delectable fruits seemingly at her command.

Everyone knew that her plants were touched with magic,

because who else but she could grow lilies edged in silver,

nuts of every hue, and sunowers that sang songs to the sky?

Some in her city said that her gardens were unnatural, but

most saw her achievements as a perfect melding of nature

and magic.

In the prime of her life, Ephinia achieved her greatest

work: a tree that bore apples made of ruby. The tree became

the centerpiece of her garden, and Ephinia was acclaimed

as queen for her magical prowess. The elf city prospered

under her wise guidance, and all was well for the next two

hundred years.

At  last,  however,  the  city  fell  on  hard  times.  A  great

green dragon moved into the nearby forest, and its preda-

tions drove game from the area and poisoned the land.

Orcs came in the dragons wake and began to drive away

the  friendly  humanoids  with  whom  the  elves  traded.

Ephinia created a magic shield over the city to keep out

nonelves, and her magic kept her people fed, though the

city was isolated from all other races. Several elves went

forth to slay the dragon in hopes of freeing their city, but

none returned.

Then a strange young elf calling himself Ervadrith arrived

in the city, claiming to be a great-nephew of one of the elders.

He said that his parents had been slain by the green dragon

while accompanying him here. He was taken in for foster-

ing despite the lack of a family member to present him

properly. Ervadrith showed a keen interest in gardening, and

eventually he earned the right to tend the queens garden

along with her son Hionyron, who was the guardian of

nature for the city.

A few days later, Hionyron was found dead beside a crater

where the precious apple tree once stood. Ervadrith and the

tree were gone. Gone too was the magic shield that protected

the city, as became all too clear when the green dragon ew

overhead and attacked. Ephinia and her people put up a brave

ght, but most of the populace was slain and the city reduced

to ruins. Ephinia herself disappeared, never to be seen again.

All that remained of her garden was a single weeping willow

sapling with blackened fronds.

The surviving elves went forth to discover what had hap-

pened. In their travels through the now-twisted land, they

discovered no trace of ruby apples, and no evidence that

an elf named Ervadrith had ever existed, even when they

traveled to the town from which he claimed to have come.

Not until a brave elf named Fermandor ventured below the

surface with a band of human and dwarf adventurers was the

mystery solved, for they found a grand drow city with a ruby

apple embedded in each of its gates.

Piecing together the tale took quite some time, but even-

tually the brave band discovered that Ervadrith had been

a drow, magically altered to resemble a surface-dwelling

elf. The green dragon had seen the tree glittering from the

queens courtyard when he ew above and coveted the unique

treasure for his hoard. Unable to penetrate the citys defenses,

he made a deal with a band of drow passing through the area

on an exploratory mission: Retrieve the tree for him and

defeat the magic shield, and he would raze the city of their

hated rivals to the ground.

The drow agreed, and the altered Ervadrith passed easily

through the citys wards, which did not prevent the passage

of dark elves. Biding his time, Ervadrith brewed a poison

with which to slay the guardian of nature and prepared a

special pot in which to transport the tree. After slaying

Hionyron, he plucked two apples from the tree and pocketed

them, then used arcane magic to reduce the tree to the size

of a ower, which he potted. Before slipping out into the

night, he stabbed Ephinia while she was in her trance, thus

negating the shield that her own essence had powered. After

delivering the tree to the dragon, he demanded fulllment

of their bargain.

The elves tried to retrieve the apple tree, but the dragon

was too powerful, and all but one of them were slain. The sole

survivor of Ephinias city now roams the world in search of

companions who can help her slay the dragon and retrieve

the tree.

Adventure Hook: The sole survivor of the lost elf city

entreats the PCs to help her slay the green dragon, now grown

to ancient age. The creatures hoard has been enriched with

many ruby apples, but the tree died long ago because the

dragon could not sustain it in the poisonous swamp that was

its home. A tall, graceful weeping willow towers above the

ruins of the old elf city, and any elf who pauses for a trance

beneath it hears the voice of Ephinia, mourning her son and

her city.

Alain and Alarin, the Giant-Killers

Long ago, in an elf community at the edge of a great forest,

twin sons were born to an elf named Melissina. Children are

always looked upon as a gift in an elf community, and twins

are rare enough to be considered blessings of the gods. The

boys were named Alain and Alarin, and they soon became

the darlings of the whole town.

The two boys grew up wiry, lithe, and daring as only young

elves can be. The community looked upon their childish antics

with bemusement, and everyone indulged the twoexcept

their younger cousin Maeve, whose weapon skills were

deplorable. Maeve was jealous of the twins, and she sought

any excuse to belittle their achievements and get them into

trouble with the elders. She had little chance to do the former,

however, since both boys excelled at whatever they tried.

They were particularly skilled with the bow, and they soon

joined the community watch, insisting upon assignment to

the same patrol.

Maeve knew that the boys could not resist a mystery, so she

took pains to draw them away from their compatriots while

they were on watch, hoping they would encounter trouble

they couldnt handle, or at worst draw reprimands from the

captain of the watch.

One day, Maeve carefully laid a trail of footprints leading to

a small patch of quicksand she had discovered near the edge

of a marsh. Sure enough, the boys spotted it and broke off

from the group to follow. Instead of falling into the quicksand

themselves, they arrived just in time to rescue a human who

had blundered into the quicksand from the other direction.

The human turned out to be a kings son, and he pledged

friendship to the elf community and sent gifts to the town

in gratitude.

Another time, Maeve spread the rumor of a whispering

tree near the edge of a high cliff. The route that her cousins

took to investigate led them past a dryad whose tree was

being hacked apart by orcs. The two drove the evil humanoids

away and called for the guardian of nature to mend the tree,

making yet another valuable friend for the community.

Finally, Maeve saw her chance to be rid of her troublesome

cousins once and for all. While gathering mosses for her

aunts garden in a small valley, she chanced to see two hill

giants inspecting a cave in a hillside. As she watched, the

two settled into the cave and began foraging for food. Noting

their movements, she circled the area until she caught sight

of a small band of orcs hunting game. Following them at a

discreet distance, she picked up a broken spearhead, pock-

eted it, and planted it on the trail between the town and the

giants new lair.

Upon returning to town, she told the watch captain that

a small orc patrol was marauding in the hills. The captain

dispatched the twins patrol and, as Maeve had predicted, the

two young elves spotted the broken spearhead and went off

alone in search of the orcs. What they found were two hungry

hill giants already headed in the direction of the elves town.

They took cover quickly in the underbrush on either side of

the trail, but the giants had already spotted Alain. Come

Giants search in vain for

Alarin and Alain

here, little elf! they roared as they charged the bush into

which Alain had vanished.

Suddenly, an arrow pierced the male giants leg. Im over

here, you big oafs! shouted Alarin from his position on the

other side of the trail. The giants turned and charged toward

Alarin, who had quickly ducked back into the concealing

brush. Meanwhile, Alain, who had moved farther away while

the giants were distracted, let  y an arrow at the female. Dont

you have eyes? Im over here! he shouted.

Back  and  forth  the  two  giants  charged,  taking  arrows

from both twins and roaring in frustration as their quarry

kept popping up  rst on one side and then the other. The

two brothers led the giants on a zigzag path back toward

the trail that their patrol had taken, making as much noise

as possible.

The patrol leader soon heard the commotion and went

to investigate. When he saw the two giants being baited by

the twins and realized where they were heading, he rushed

back to his unit and told the elves to begin gathering brush

to conceal a large, natural sinkhole near the bottom of a

rocky hill. Working quickly, they covered the sinkhole

well enough that even their own people might not realize

it was there. Then the elves hid themselves behind the trees

and waited.

The twins harried the giants closer and closer to the trap.

When they came within sight of the patrol, the leader called

out a signal using a birdcall. Alain and Alarin understood and

guided the giants toward the hidden sinkhole. As planned,

the female giant stepped squarely on the concealing brush

and toppled into the sinkhole. The male, however, teetered

precariously on the edge. Eager to  nish the job, Alain leaped

forward and pushed the giant hard, knocking him into the

pit. Unfortunately, the giant managed to grab Alain and drag

him in as well.

Thinking quickly, Alarin stepped to the edge of the pit

and let  y an arrow. Screaming in rage, the giant dropped

Alain and reached for his quarry. Alain sprang to the other

end of the pit and was helped to safety by his comrades.

When the two giants got to their feet, they towered well over

the edge of the pit, but the elves were ready. Firing volley after

volley of arrows, they kept their distance from the giants,

who could not pursue them until they climbed out of the

sinkhole. By the time they did, the elves deadly arrows had

already nearly  nished them. The giants fell only a few feet

from the pit, arrows protruding from almost every part of

their bodies.

The twins were hailed for their bravery in saving the town

from the giants and for their quick thinking in leading the

monstrous foes to the other elves. Alain and Alarin honed

their skills still further in the watch before striking out on

their own as adventurers.

Adventure Hook: Now a wizard of some power, Maeve

still holds a grudge against her cousins, who achieved fame

and fortune in their adventuring careers before retiring to

share the rulership of their town. The two have recently

fostered their niece in the household of a human king with

whom they hope to cement an alliance, and his son has come

to foster with the elves. Maeve directly or indirectly hires the

PCs to rescue the elf princess held captive by the humans

and return her to her people. In fact, the girl allows herself

to  be  rescued  if  the  heroes  appear,  because  she  is  rather

bored by life with the humans, who insist that she maintain

a regular schedule. Should the PCs succeed, the girls return

will be viewed as an insult to the human kingdom and an

embarrassment to the twins.

LANGUAGE

Elven is an ancient language of lyrical beauty. Though schol-

ars differ on whether Elven or Dwarven developed  rst, both

are among the oldest written and spoken tongues and serve

as the parent languages of a variety of other races languages

as well. The Elven script forms the basis for the written forms

of Sylvan, Aquan, and Undercommon.

Elven is a  uid language, rich in subtle intonation and com-

plex in grammar and syntax. It has few words for earth, stone,

industry, or engineering, but many for tree,  ower, nature,

and beauty. It is ill suited to talk of drudgery or mechanics,

and indeed most terminology for such topics is adapted from

Common or Dwarven; Elven does not lend itself well to dry,

technical topics.

However, no other tongue expresses emotions, beauty,

philosophy, or theory as well as Elven does. The language

allows  for  a  fine  degree  of  differentiation  among  the

various  kinds  of  plants  and  animals,  natural  features,

weather patterns, and other topics relating to nature. It

also expresses joy, sorrow, love, and other deep emotions

with  a  clarity  and  vitality  that  no  other  language  can

achieve. Its lyrical quality and variety of verbiage makes

it ideal for ballads, poetry, and prose. Bards prize songs

in the Elven tongue, whether or not they understand the

language, because its tones lend themselves well to music

and complex rhythms.

Elven is also well suited for magic because it can precisely

express ideas and concepts that cannot be seen. Since wizards

and other arcane casters wishing to develop spells must

conceptualize the desired results with perfect clarity, it is

no wonder that elves have a knack for magical research.

Elven words can be of any length. Double vowels are

common, as are words that seem to have their own innate

rhythm or alliteration. Words are sometimes combined

to achieve a specific meaning, but modifiers are usually

separate words that follow the word to which they pertain.

Subjects are often left out of sentences, particularly when

they are pronouns. Derivative words (that is, words linguisti-

cally related to others) are common, and complex levels of

meaning can be achieved in the spoken form of the language

merely through intonation. A few linguists of other races

have theorized that elves can hold two entirely unrelated

conversations at once, with the words making up each one

communicated entirely by intonation. Little if any evidence

has ever been found to support this claim, but there is no

doubt that the meanings of Elven words and the emotion

behind them are enhanced by the manner in which they

are spoken.

Spoken Elven has a lilting quality that makes it pleasing

to the ear, almost like a song that is spoken rather than sung.

When set to music, Elven can bring a tear to the eye of even

the most stoic listener.

Elven literature is vast and complex because almost every

elf has time to write at least one epic story, song, or poem in

his long lifetime. Though the oral tradition is strong within

the elf race, most stories are written down as well as passed

along orally, giving them a sounder foundation than those

of races that depend heavily on the spoken word. Nearly all

of elf society is literate, and most read for pleasure as well as

for purpose. Because elves prize both personal liberty and

literary accomplishment, solitary pursuits such as reading for

pleasure are quite popular in elf communities. Elven educa-

tion involves both books and hands-on interactive teaching

because elves believe that all the senses should be engaged

in learning.

ELVEN PHRASEBOOK

The following phrases and idioms are common in elven

culture, so elf PCs may utter them from time to time. You can

use either the actual Elven words or the English translations,

depending on your style at the gaming table.

Lida inorum saenes. A literal translation of this Elven phrase

is Strength is in the heartwood. It is used in two ways,

differentiated by intonation. One usage means that true

strength comes from within, from the hidden depths of a

persons soul. The other usage means that items made with

time and care, built up from the inside out, are the best and

the strongest.

Sharti tra fanil, nif  orisa. Where the tree fails, the seed

grows. Initial failure can open up new opportunities which

may eventually lead to success. After all, a fallen tree still

scatters its seeds far and wide, and from those new trees

can grow.

Gar veri tani veritam sif , e ta veri Garni veritam eso sif .

Odelhir, niefendil gar fer ta, sil inti millentu. An owl living a

foxs life is a fool, and vice versa. In the dark of the moon,

one cannot tell an owl from a fox, but the owl and the fox

both know. This somewhat convoluted sentiment means

that its fine to do your own thing when you know what

youre doing. An owl is very good at being an owl, and it

seldom looks foolish or goes far wrong when it does things

for which it is suited. Only the individual knows if she is

an owl or a fox. Others may think they know and name her

a fool, but then it is they who are the owl playing at being

the fox.

Shunti iltem ili resoshi nu, pellinta wylinta hiine venisu kiins.

When someone gives you hope, look to see what your coun-

selor has reserved for himself. Advice or assistance can be

given for many reasons, not all of them altruistic. Even the

best advice or assistance can come at great cost and sacri ce,

both for those who give it and those who follow it.

Vivendi thosel sennivi, nievana sen s. Elrad losi sennivi, nievana

what its depth. A green leaf is lovely, no matter how short the

day. This phrase admonishes the listener to appreciate beauty

for what it is and not worry so much about what lies beneath

or how long it might last. The reference to the length of the

day alludes to the coming of autumn, an event that does not

detract from summer beauty and indeed possesses a beauty

of its own.

Avel niemel sikki mor hiedoso welsa, op avel inorum nekra. A

sword unseen is no less sharp than a sword held openly, or

one in a sheath. Beware the unseen danger, and the danger

that is present but kept in check.

ELVEN SCRIPT

The Elven alphabet consists of sixty-two characters, including

at least four versions of every vowel used in Common. The

script is as owing and expressive as the spoken language,

and it takes years to learn how to render properly.

NAMING

Names are quite important to elves, who follow a practice of

taking personal names associated with specic qualities or

characteristics. Spoken in Elven, the names naturally sound

exotic and lyrical to nonelven ears.

The random name generator presented below is intended

to demonstrate a range of potential name choices. Feel free

to invent your own entries for the tables.

Each elven name consists of a prefix (from Table 12)

and one or more suffixes (from Table 13). In the case of

You can randomly generate an elven name by rolling on

Table 11 and then following the resulting directions with

additional rolls on Tables 12 and 13. If you prefer, it is also

possible to pick a set of denitions you like and assemble a

name that matches them.

If you have randomly generated a name and dont like

its definition, try altering the order of the words. It is also

possible to use the definition as just a starting place for a

names meaning. Often the definitions can be combined

in a poetic way for better results. In the case of a name

with three or more syllables, try dropping one or more

of  the  definitions.  For  example,  Anenfel  could  mean

the Hand of Autumns Lake, Lake of Autumns Hand,

Autumns  Hand,  or  just  Autumn  Lake.  Dont  worry

about two names sharing the same meaning or having two

ELF CITIES AND

SETTLEMENTS

Elves leave existing settlements to form new ones for a variety

of reasons, the most common of which is sustainability. Elves

keep  a  very  close  eye  on  the  resource  utilization  of  their

towns. When the master builder or the guardian of nature

decrees that a population has reached the maximum size that

the nearby resources can support, some of its people must

move on to found a new town.

Selection of the site for a new settlement is a lengthy

process involving input from all the prospective settlers.

The site must be defensible, have a ready source of water

and other resources, and be aesthetically pleasing. The soil

should be fertile and capable of supporting a variety of plant

life. Ideally, the site should be forested, but elves can also

build towns in deserts, plains, and undersea environments.

Finally, raw materials for the creation of the arts and crafts

so essential to elven life should be readily available.

A typical elf settlement is described below, as a reference

for DMs looking to design their own and as a location for use

in a campaign that features elves.

THE ELVEN ECONOMY

The elven economy is driven primarily by mutual gifting

and barter. Though gold and silver are just as rare in an elf

society as they are in any other surface realm, elves rarely

need currency to buy anything; they make almost everything

they need themselves. Since one elf may prefer one kind of

work to another and thus develop more skill with it, they do

sometimes barter their skills with other elves so that all can

pursue  their  own  passions  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.

Gold, silver, and precious gems are valued for their beauty,

though elves do understand the lure that such materials have

for other races and sometimes present them as gifts to cement

alliances or thank benefactors outside their race.

In addition to trading goods and services with one another,

elves frequently present each other with gifts. There is no

requirement  that  an  elf  who  receives  a  valuable  gift  must

reciprocate with one of equal value, but one of equal beauty

and workmanship is the norm. No occasion is necessary for

exchanging  gifts,  but  festivals,  holy  days,  and  impromptu

celebrations are common occasions for the exchange of gifts

between friends and loved ones. Elves do not pay taxes, but

they  are  all  equally  responsible  for  maintaining  the  com-

munity stores. They rarely amass personal fortunes in gold,

silver, and other materials of value to others, regardless of

their status within the community.

Most elf communities do mint some coins for  use in

trading with other races, though they are equally willing

to  barter  finished  goods  with  other  folk.  Elf  communi-

ties maintain no central treasury, since no elf wants the

responsibility of protecting it from those who would covet

its contents. Instead, they create coinage only when they

require it. A few elves become interested in the numismatic

art and produce exceptionally beautiful coins, but most see

little point in making and hoarding gold in the form of coins

when it could be worked into beautiful jewelry instead. Elves

know how much gold is in any coin they make, but they

accept the valuation of other cultures rather than imposing

their own.

EXAMPLE SETTLEMENT:

WINDINGWATER

Windingwater is built in the trees of an old forest through

which a river cuts a winding path. The soil is rich, and the

trees tower at least 100 feet above the ground. Their boles

measure between 6 and 8 feet across, sometimes more.

The river widens and narrows, but averages about 20 feet

in width and about half that depth. To the east of the river is

an 80-foot-high bluff. Its existence would be hardly notice-

able since it is lower than most of the trees, except for one

towering hollow oak atop it.

As with many elf cities, visitors to Windingwater rarely

notice the town until they are inside it. The homes and other

structures are built high in the trees, and the rope ladders

that provide access to them can be rolled up when not in use.

Rope-and-plank bridges connect the various buildings and

serve as walkways through the village.

A typical tree home consists of one or more platforms

connected by ladders. Most have wooden plank walls and

ceilings that can be retracted to leave various rooms open to

the sky in clear weather. Rooms may be formed by permanent

wooden walls or by hanging panels. Paintings, murals, or

frescoes often decorate interiors.

Temple of Corellon/Armory: The Temple of Corellon

Larethian in Windingwater is a platform structure built over

three large trees at the top of the bluff. Capable of housing

the entire community in an emergency, the temple is stocked

with basic supplies. The worship area is a spacious room with

a  retractable  ceiling  and  an  altar  shaped  from  saelas.  (For

information about saelas, see Wildwood, page 169.) Branches

of the trees stick up through various portions of the  oor,

and the walls between are decorated with lifelike patterns

of branches and leaves.

One section of the temple serves as an armory and a muster-

ing area for the watch. Bows, arrows, longswords, and various

other weapons are stored here; the junior clerics of Corellon

keep them well maintained.

The clerics of Corellon all have rooms in the temple, but

some also maintain residences in the town. The High Priest

of Windingwater, Amyn Silverstar, occupies the largest of

these rooms, and he has decorated it to resemble the sky

at dawn.

Meeting Area: This large open area just below the bluff

is visible only from above. It serves as the location for town

meetings, theatrical events, poetry readings, dances, and

other impromptu gatherings. Grass carpets the ground and

 owers edge the surrounding trees, despite the many feet

that tread on the area.

Rulers  Dwelling:  Panadil  Nightbreeze,  the  King  of

Windingwater, dwells in this large but not ostentatious

tri-level tree home with his family. His wife Tynowen and

their two children Mor ndil and Galadan live here with

Bylil and Rengiil, the children of relatives who are fostering

here. A sizable garden featuring climbing vines, vegetables,

and every kind of lily imaginable grows around the base of

their tree. A platform at the rear of the structure juts out

over the meeting area, enabling the king to address the

townsfolk conveniently.

Community Stores: The communitys stores of dried

fruit, dried meat, root vegetables, preserves, and other non-

perishable foods are kept in this two-level structure at the top

of a particularly tall tree at a bend in the river. Rope ladders

all around the trunk provide easy access but can be taken up

when danger threatens.

Below the tree is the communitys well. This water supply

is largely used for gardens, though a rope and pulley system

enables the elves to draw fresh water up to their tree homes

without having to leave the safety of the treetops.

Archery Range: To the west of the river is a large, open

area with a series of targets at the far end. The master of

arms conducts archery training here for the young elves of

the village, and members of the watch practice here to hone

their skills.

Orchard/Memorial Garden/Compost Pit: To the west

of the river, just south of town, is an orchard planted and

tended by the towns guardian of nature. The trees are not

planted in rows, and they are not organized by type. Rather,

they are artfully arranged to resemble a natural stand of trees

and interspersed with hardwoods, including sugar maples.

Brambleberry vines climb many of the trunks, and lower

berry bushes dot the open areas between trees.

Elves may help themselves to fruit from the orchards, and

any excess produce is dried or made into preserves and taken

to the community stores at the end of the harvest season.

On  the  other  side  of  the  river  from  the  orchard  is  the

memorial garden, where shrines are kept to honor elves who

have passed to the next world. The shrines are small niches

carved into tree trunks, small structures built of stones or

saelas on the ground, or open containers hanging from the

lower branches of small trees. Each shrine contains a likeness

of the deceased elf, his or her name, and various artworks and

mementos placed there by loved ones.

The paths through the memorial garden are lined with

 owering shrubs and carefully manicured. Benches placed

here and there allow visitors to pause and re ect.

North of the orchard is a compost pit where the community

dumps all organic waste. The guardian of nature tends the pit

and distributes the resulting fertilizer to the community.

Library:  Across  the  river  from  the  community  stores,

nestled in another bend of the river, is a tall tree that sup-

ports the communitys library. The library contains a copy of

each poem, story, or other literary work that the community

members have ever produced. Several wings are devoted to

magical writings. Scrolls of all the arcane spells that com-

munity members wish to share are here, organized by school.

Numerous treatises on research methods, the philosophy of

magic, and the uses of various spells are kept here as well. The

library also contains drawings and plans for future expansion

of the community.

Owlery: Windingwater is home to owls of all sorts. The

residents  often  tame  and  train  these  creatures  to  carry

messages, hunt small game, and scout the area by night for

intruders. The owlery is an immense, one-room tree structure

three stories tall, with branches sticking through openings

in the walls to serve as natural perches. The owls usually fend

for themselves, but when game is scarce, the residents provide

their owls with food and water here. These owls are trained

to respond to basic commands, such as come, hunt, and

scout, from any elf. Many of the owls nest and raise their

young within the structure because it provides shelter from

the elements and the safety of numbers.

Artisans Glade/Saelas Grove: North of the bluff and

on the same side of the river is the Artisans Glade. The elves

come here to create works of art in a peaceful setting where

they can visit with other artists and become inspired by each

others work. Numerous sculptures are on permanent display

here, along with miniature tree homes done as models to

demonstrate architectural features. On any given day, vari-

ous members of the community can be found here painting,

sculpting, or working metal at the forge at the far end. Poetry

readings occur here spontaneously.

Just north of the Artisans Glade stands the communitys

saelas grove. The trees here have been formed into various

fantastic shapes. Many of their branches suggest recognizable

objects such as weapons, armor, furniture, ladders, kitchen

implements, or something else that an elf might wish to make

out of wood.

Cistern:  Atop  the  bluff  that  overlooks  the  village  is  a

particularly tall tree. Near the top is a small platform and

a simple pump. The hollow trunk of this great tree serves

as a large cistern that stores rainwater. This water supply is

for emergency use in case the river and well ever become

compromised. The water here can also be pumped through

a series of wooden tubes to a sprinkling system to wet down

the houses below in case of  re.

Stables/Kennels: Just south of the archery range are sev-

eral buildings on the ground that serve both as poor-weather

housing for the communitys horses and for breeding elven

hounds (see page 189).

Water Wheels: At two points on the river are water wheels

that provide power for grinding grain, operating pumps, and

running pulleys that lift building materials and heavy items

to the treetops.

CREATING ELF

CHARACTERS

Elves  are  always  interesting  characters  to  roleplay  in  a

campaign. They are well educated, pleasant, and generally

accepting of the customs of others. In addition, they are

exceptionally talented spellcasters, deadly in ranged combat

and capable of holding their own in melee as well.

Elves are familiar to anyone who has played in a fantasy

setting, and everyone knows how they generally look and

act.  Nevertheless,  they  can  be  as  individual  as  you  wish,

based on their classes and personal histories. The elves racial

tendency toward chaos means that each elf in unique. The

elf wizard is a classic type, as are the ranger/archer and the

bard. Elf paladins and barbarians are rare, but rogues are

quite common.

No matter what class you choose, consider spending some

skill points in Search even if thats a cross-class skill for your

character. Because of the elfs racial ability to make a Search

check to nd secret doors whenever she passes within 5 feet

of one, an elf with a high Search modier can be invaluable in

an adventuring party. Spot and Listen are also good options,

because the racial bonus your character receives already

augments those skills.

As an elf, you qualify for some specic feats and prestige

classes (described in this book) that are unavailable to PCs

of other races.

Feats: Elf Dilettante, Focused Mind, Lightfeet.

Prestige  Classes:  Champion  of  Corellon  Larethian,

wildrunner.

ELVES AS CHARACTERS

Due to their racial abilities and cultural predilections, elves

make superb wizards. However, the elfs bonus to Dexterity

also stands him in good stead as an archer and a rogue, open-

ing a wide array of class options.

Barbarian: Elf barbarians are somewhat rare, because the

elfs Constitution penalty makes melee ghting somewhat

problematical and because elves are known for their high

degree of culture. Still, the Constitution bonus from the

classs rage ability can make up for that penalty on a temporary

basis. Elf barbarians usually come from isolated tribes that

have regressed from their previous level of civilization over

the course of eons.

Bard: Elf bards are well respected in their communities,

and many have long and impressive adventuring careers. The

great beauty for which elves are justly famous makes them

welcome in almost any community, as do the ballads they

write in their own lyrical tongue. Elves are quite procient

at raising the courage of their companions in combat, as well

as increasing their competence at various skills.

Cleric: Elf clerics often use divine favor, entropic shield,

and shield of faith in combat. Spiritual weapon makes a nice

companion to ranged attacks. Searing light is also good for

elf clerics because they generally have good ranged attack

bonuses. As clerics, elves can play exceptionally strong sup-

porting roles for their parties.

Druid: Many elves choose the path of the druid simply

because their race is close to nature. With their racial bow

and sword prociencies, elves can be exceptionally effective

as druids.

Fighter: Elf ghters generally prefer ranged weapons,

particularly the longbow. Their racial bonus to Dexterity

makes them exceptional archers, though they can hold

their own in melee combat. Their apparent physical frailty

does not translate into a penalty to Strength, so they can be

effective with nearly any martial weapon. Their penalty to

Constitution, however, means they dont have the hit points

to endure melee combat as well as most other ghters, so they

are wise to stay out of melee range as long as possible.

Monk: Most elves are chaotic, so very few of them pursue

the path of monk. Still, those few elves who take pleasure

in order nd that their racial prociency with the bow and

their bonus to Dexterity makes them more effective than

most monks with ranged weapons, and the Dexterity bonus

improves their Armor Class and their effectiveness with

certain monk abilities.

Paladin: As with monks, few elves become paladins because

of the alignment requirement. Those who do choose this path

often worship a deity associated with some other race, because

the elven gods include no lawful good deities. Some follow

Vandria Gilmadrith, even though she is a lawful neutral deity,

since many aspects of her dogma appeal to the paladins nature.

Such a career choice often effectively severs an elf paladin

from his community because he tends to seem rather staid.

Like elf ghters, elf paladins are most effective with ranged

weapons, and they tend to avoid melee combat.

For alternative options for the elf paladin, see the elf racial

substitution levels on page 155.

Ranger: The path of the ranger is a common choice for

elves, who glory in the woodlands. Elf rangers protect their

communities as well as the surrounding forest, and they

make good use of the rangers archery specialty. Two-weapon

ghting  is  a  less  effective  choice  for  elf  rangers  because

their Constitution penalty makes them less effective in

melee combat.

For alternative options for the elf ranger, see the elf racial

substitution levels on page 155.

Rogue:  Rogue  is  a  good  choice  for  elves  because  their

racial bonus to Dexterity improves both their Armor Class

and  most  of  their  skill  modiers.  Their  racial  bonuses  on

Listen,  Search,  and  Spot  checks  also  stand  them  in  good

stead as rogues. In addition, elf rogues can inltrate almost

any society because elves are welcomed by most races.

Sorcerer: Elf sorcerers often gravitate toward weaponlike

spells and weapon-enhancing spells such as Melfs acid arrow,

true strike, and ray spells. Cats grace adds to an elf sorcerers

natural Dexterity bonus to make him even more effective.

Wizard: Wizard is the favored class of elves, and for good

reasonthey train in the use of magic almost from birth.

Their long lives lend themselves well to wizardry, which

involves lengthy study and book learning. Most elf wizards

accumulate a signicant number of spells for their spellbooks

over their lifetimes. Those who take item creation feats may

manufacture a large number of magic items for their own

use and for sale outside the community. Many elf wizards

research new spells and create new items, taking decades to

perfect their techniques.

For alternative options for the elf wizard, see the elf racial

substitution levels on page 157.

urious and active, open but secretive, halings are

among the least understood races in a DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS campaign. Short in stature and stout in

heart, halings are always on the move, at home in

any land but calling none their own. Most other

races hold a skewed view of halings, despite their generally

friendly nature and ubiquitous presence.

Since  halflings  rarely  put  down  roots,  they  tend  to

know a great deal about the world and its peoples. However,

this knowledge never makes them world-weary or jaded;

their innate curiosity and optimism lets them see each

day as a new opportunity. Indeed, it is a rare halfling who

can pass up an opportunity, regardless of the danger it

may hold.

This  chapter  provides  a  window  into  the  world  of  the

halings  and  offers  a  framework  upon  which  players  and

DMs may expand for their own campaigns.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Melo  Brownthistle  stirred  as  a  small  shaft  of  light  struck

his  pillow.  The  sunlight  shone  through  several  chinks  in

the frame of his familys wagon, creating a dazzling display

of light shafts and motes. Stretching to his full 3-foot 2-inch

height, he rolled over and sniffed the air. Fresh biscuits and

bacon! he cried, his eyes snapping open.

After dressing in his worn brown linen breeches and a

bright green shirt with long blousy sleeves, he combed his

hair and wove it into dozens of tiny braids, each of which

he secured with a bead clasp. Then he belted his shirt with

a strip of blue fabric, tied a blue bandanna over his head

at what he hoped was a rakish angle, and pulled on his

knee-high black boots.

He gave his little sister a shake to wake her, then stepped

out into the cool morning air and surveyed the camp.

Twenty-two wagons stood here and there in the grassy

meadow where they had stopped last night, situated so

that they could easily be pulled into a more compact

circle should trouble arise. Goats, ponies, and horses

grazed peacefully nearby, and a few pigs gamboled in

the mud at the edge of the campsite. Uncle Gren was

busily tending to the hoof of one of their ponies, which

seemed  to  have  developed  a  slight  limp,  and  Thea

Brushwhisper, the head teamster, was talking to one

of the Hillrover clan about their wagon. Children

were playing a rough-and-tumble game of tag in the

open space at the center of the camp, and someone

was cooking breakfast in front of every wagon.

Dont  just  stand  there  woolgathering,  said  his

mother sharply from behind him. Go and fetch some

water from that stream so I can make some coffee.

Picking up a bucket, Melo ran to do as he was told.

37

wagons  left  rear  wheel.  Its  not  going  to  take  another

fifty miles.

Ill  see  to  it   rst  thing  tomorrow  morning,  his  father

promised.

A  few  moments  later,  the  wagons  began  to  roll.  Melos

family took up their usual place toward the rear of the caravan

as it began to move. His father drove, and his mother sat in

the back with Melo and his sister. Melo mended a torn har-

ness while his mother gave Pery her lessons in reading and

numbers. Every so often, Melo held up a few  ngers behind

his mother to give Pery the answer. Later, his mother began

to sew a new pair of breeches for him, using the linen she

had woven at their last extended camp.

After a lunch of beef jerky and hard rolls, Melo crawled to

the front of the wagon to sit with his father. While the miles

rolled past, the two told each other stories and sang songs.

Pigs,  goats,  cows,  and  other  animals  trotted  alongside  the

wagons, stopping to graze a bit and then catching up when

the trailer urged them on.

By late afternoon, they had reached the open  eld outside

Everfall where Farmer Ephraim let them camp. People said

At the stream, he stopped to chat for a bit with his friends

Ien and Cala. Dad got us a couple of rabbits for supper last

night, said Cala.

I hope we get some chicken tonight when we get to Ever-

fall, said Ien. Its only seven or eight hours away now.

Melo fondly remembered the human city of Everfall, where

his  caravan  had  stopped  for  a  few  weeks  about  two  years

ago.  The  people  had  seemed  friendly,  at  least  for  a  while,

and everyone had eaten well on the money they made from

helping with the towns potato harvestnot to mention the

potatoes they had gotten as a bonus.

By the time Melo and his friends walked back to camp,

breakfast was ready. Its about time, said his mother huff-

ily,  putting  the  water  on  to  boil.  She  broke  into  a  smile

when Melo showed her the berries that he and his friends

had picked on their way back. Soon the whole family was

eating biscuits with fresh butter, crisp bacon, and berries

with fresh cream.

After breakfast, Melo cleaned up while his mother and

father started to pack everything back into the wagon. They

had taken out only what they needed last nightdirty clothes

to wash in the stream, pots and pans for  xing meals, and

gear for cleaning harnesses. Melos sister Pery gathered

the dry laundry from the line and packed it away

in the wagon.

When the dishes and pots

were packed up, Thea came

by  to  inspect  the  wagon.

Youd  better  get  that

wheel  xed when we get

to  Everfall,  Galan,  she

said, pointing at the

While his dog performs a trick, a hal ing lightens the pouch of an onlooker

the reason for the farmers hospitality was because Thea

Brushwhisper had done the good farmer a favor years ago

by catching and returning his prize bull. No one else could

get near the beast, but Thea walked right up to it, singing all

the while, and it followed her back to its pen like a lamb. The

farmer was amazed, but everyone in the caravan knew Thea

had a way with animals. As Mother always said, doing favors

for others usually made you friends, and having friends in a

lot of places was important.

After helping his parents unload for the night, Melo headed

off for weapons practice. Tonights weapon was the skiprock,

which  Melo  especially  loved.  Still,  he  was  having  trouble

getting any distance with it, so Cala showed him how she

used her wrist to put a little extra power into her throw. Melo

downed a pigeon in  ight on his  rst throw after that.

After cleaning the pigeon and giving the carcass to his

mother, Melo took a bath in the stream at the edge of the

 eld and put on some drab-colored clothes. He and his father

walked to Everfall and visited their favorite tavern. While

his father spun yarns to entertain the locals, Melo slit the

strings of a few heavy purses and helped himself to some of

the coins. He was careful to fray the strands of the ties that

had held the purses in place and to leave a few coins behind,

so that the owners might think the straps had broken and

some of the coins had rolled out. He then rejoined his father,

and they made for the camp.

On the way back, he and his father slipped into a farmers

barn and emerged with a sack full of fresh vegetables, a few

eggs, and a pair of chickens, their necks neatly broken. Melo

wanted to nab some of the fresh bread cooling on the window

sill of the farmers house, but his father laid a restraining

hand on his arm. We have plenty, Melo. To take more than

you need is an invitation to get caught.

That night in camp, Melo stowed the coins he had appropri-

ated in the secret cache inside the wagon. He and his family

feasted on squab and chicken, beans, carrots, and biscuits with

butter. Dessert was a pie made with the rest of the berries

that Melo had picked that morning.

After dinner, everyone helped to clean up the dishes, and

then the family joined the rest of the caravan around the

 re. Several people plucked a lively tune on their stringed

instruments, and the rest of the hal ings began to dance.

When their energy was spent, they dropped to the ground,

passed around bottles of homemade ale, and began to tell

stories. This part of the day was Melos favorite. The tales of

Melos great-uncle, the famous rogue, and his great-great-

grandmother, a master of the con dence game, inspired him

to do great deeds himself one day.

As a canopy of stars shone overhead, Melo returned to

the wagon and undressed. After pulling on a nightshirt, he

curled up in his bed to sleep. A lone musician was still outside

playing a slow, soft tune, and a night bird sang in a tree right

over the wagon. His mind danced with dreams of the great

adventures he would have someday as he  nally drifted off

to sleep.

DESCRIPTION

Hal ings are short and wiry, standing about 3 feet tall and

weighing between 30 and 35 pounds. Females are slightly

shorter than males, but no less strong. Their bodies are well

proportioned, though their heads are somewhat elongated

compared with those of humans. They are longer-lived than

humans are, reaching maturity at 20 years of age and often

living well past the age of 100.

Most hal ings have ruddy skin, dark eyes, and straight

black hair, though lighter shades of hair are known in many

societies. Males often wear sideburns, though they almost

never grow beards or mustaches. All hal ings prefer to wear

their hair long, often braided or styled in some distinctive

way. Their features are more delicate than those of humans,

and their ears are elongated and slightly pointed.

CLOTHING

Hal ings prefer simple, comfortable clothing that can stand

up to mud, blood, rain, snow, and the wear and tear that comes

with the traveling life. The fabrics come from natural sources,

most commonly wool, linen, and cotton. Hal ings often

use leather in their garments to lend strength and weather

resistance. This leather is usually made out of cow, horse,

or goat hide, and it may be either thin and supple or thick,

in exible, and sturdy, depending on its desired use. Fur is

rarely used, and then only for trim or for warmth, usually in

the form of entire animal skins used as blankets.

Hal ings make many of their own textiles, but they often

obtain additional supplies of  nished cloth from other races

through either trade or outright theft.

Most halflings express their individuality by wearing

brightly colored clothes in flamboyant styles. Multihued

garments are common, and patterns range from the geometric

to the abstract. When hal ings color their own fabric, they

use dyes made from plants they have gathered along the trail.

When they trade for  nished cloth, they seek out jewel tones

and patterned fabrics of every shade. Many hal ings also

keep a plain black or brown out t to be used for clandestine

activities at night. Most adult hal ings also own a plain,

dark-colored, voluminous cloak that they can wrap around

themselves when hiding.

Hal ings see their clothing as an extension of personal

style.  A  hal ing  of  either  gender  may  wear  a  loose- tting

tunic with billowing, slashed sleeves belted over somewhat

tighter trousers, plus a leather or fabric vest. Fastenings may

be made of metal, polished wood, or carved bone or ivory;

leather laces are also common. Hal ing women often wear

peasant-style blouses belted with bright fabric strips over one

or more long, swirling skirts in jewel-bright colors. Clothing

is typically decorated with embroidery, often in a geometric

pattern representative of a particular clan; leather vests and

boot tops are often embossed.

Hal ings  of  both  genders  wear  their  hair  in  numerous

braids or bound into ponytails and other styles with strips of

dyed leather. Many cover their heads with brightly colored

While his dog performs a trick, a hal ing lightens the pouch of an onlooker

the reason for the farmers hospitality was because Thea

Brushwhisper had done the good farmer a favor years ago

by catching and returning his prize bull. No one else could

get near the beast, but Thea walked right up to it, singing all

the while, and it followed her back to its pen like a lamb. The

farmer was amazed, but everyone in the caravan knew Thea

had a way with animals. As Mother always said, doing favors

for others usually made you friends, and having friends in a

lot of places was important.

After helping his parents unload for the night, Melo headed

off for weapons practice. Tonights weapon was the skiprock,

which  Melo  especially  loved.  Still,  he  was  having  trouble

getting any distance with it, so Cala showed him how she

used her wrist to put a little extra power into her throw. Melo

downed a pigeon in  ight on his  rst throw after that.

After cleaning the pigeon and giving the carcass to his

mother, Melo took a bath in the stream at the edge of the

 eld and put on some drab-colored clothes. He and his father

walked to Everfall and visited their favorite tavern. While

his father spun yarns to entertain the locals, Melo slit the

strings of a few heavy purses and helped himself to some of

the coins. He was careful to fray the strands of the ties that

had held the purses in place and to leave a few coins behind,

so that the owners might think the straps had broken and

some of the coins had rolled out. He then rejoined his father,

and they made for the camp.

On the way back, he and his father slipped into a farmers

barn and emerged with a sack full of fresh vegetables, a few

eggs, and a pair of chickens, their necks neatly broken. Melo

wanted to nab some of the fresh bread cooling on the window

sill of the farmers house, but his father laid a restraining

hand on his arm. We have plenty, Melo. To take more than

you need is an invitation to get caught.

That night in camp, Melo stowed the coins he had appropri-

ated in the secret cache inside the wagon. He and his family

feasted on squab and chicken, beans, carrots, and biscuits with

butter. Dessert was a pie made with the rest of the berries

that Melo had picked that morning.

After dinner, everyone helped to clean up the dishes, and

then the family joined the rest of the caravan around the

 re. Several people plucked a lively tune on their stringed

instruments, and the rest of the hal ings began to dance.

When their energy was spent, they dropped to the ground,

passed around bottles of homemade ale, and began to tell

stories. This part of the day was Melos favorite. The tales of

Melos great-uncle, the famous rogue, and his great-great-

grandmother, a master of the con dence game, inspired him

to do great deeds himself one day.

As a canopy of stars shone overhead, Melo returned to

the wagon and undressed. After pulling on a nightshirt, he

curled up in his bed to sleep. A lone musician was still outside

playing a slow, soft tune, and a night bird sang in a tree right

over the wagon. His mind danced with dreams of the great

adventures he would have someday as he  nally drifted off

to sleep.

DESCRIPTION

Hal ings are short and wiry, standing about 3 feet tall and

weighing between 30 and 35 pounds. Females are slightly

shorter than males, but no less strong. Their bodies are well

proportioned, though their heads are somewhat elongated

compared with those of humans. They are longer-lived than

humans are, reaching maturity at 20 years of age and often

living well past the age of 100.

Most hal ings have ruddy skin, dark eyes, and straight

black hair, though lighter shades of hair are known in many

societies. Males often wear sideburns, though they almost

never grow beards or mustaches. All hal ings prefer to wear

their hair long, often braided or styled in some distinctive

way. Their features are more delicate than those of humans,

and their ears are elongated and slightly pointed.

CLOTHING

Hal ings prefer simple, comfortable clothing that can stand

up to mud, blood, rain, snow, and the wear and tear that comes

with the traveling life. The fabrics come from natural sources,

most commonly wool, linen, and cotton. Hal ings often

use leather in their garments to lend strength and weather

resistance. This leather is usually made out of cow, horse,

or goat hide, and it may be either thin and supple or thick,

in exible, and sturdy, depending on its desired use. Fur is

rarely used, and then only for trim or for warmth, usually in

the form of entire animal skins used as blankets.

Hal ings make many of their own textiles, but they often

obtain additional supplies of  nished cloth from other races

through either trade or outright theft.

Most halflings express their individuality by wearing

brightly colored clothes in flamboyant styles. Multihued

garments are common, and patterns range from the geometric

to the abstract. When hal ings color their own fabric, they

use dyes made from plants they have gathered along the trail.

When they trade for  nished cloth, they seek out jewel tones

and patterned fabrics of every shade. Many hal ings also

keep a plain black or brown out t to be used for clandestine

activities at night. Most adult hal ings also own a plain,

dark-colored, voluminous cloak that they can wrap around

themselves when hiding.

Hal ings see their clothing as an extension of personal

style.  A  hal ing  of  either  gender  may  wear  a  loose- tting

tunic with billowing, slashed sleeves belted over somewhat

tighter trousers, plus a leather or fabric vest. Fastenings may

be made of metal, polished wood, or carved bone or ivory;

leather laces are also common. Hal ing women often wear

peasant-style blouses belted with bright fabric strips over one

or more long, swirling skirts in jewel-bright colors. Clothing

is typically decorated with embroidery, often in a geometric

pattern representative of a particular clan; leather vests and

boot tops are often embossed.

Hal ings  of  both  genders  wear  their  hair  in  numerous

braids or bound into ponytails and other styles with strips of

dyed leather. Many cover their heads with brightly colored

scarves or large hats to keep the sun from their eyes. Jewelry,

the  brighter  the  better,  is  popular  with  both  males  and

females, and any hal ing may wear earrings, one or more

necklaces, bracelets, or rings, and hair ornaments at the same

time, with little regard for how the accessories look together.

Most hal ing jewelry is made of carved wood, brightly col-

ored glass, wooden beadwork, or hammered gold or silver set

with gems. The style is usually handsome and heavy, though

not as squarish as the jewelry of dwarves. Hal ings often

supplement their own adornments with pieces of jewelry

appropriated from other races.

Many hal ings wear sandals when the weather is fair,

but most also own sturdy leather boots for use in inclement

weather and on dif cult terrain.

All hal ing clothing is styled for ease of movement and

appropriate to the season. When quiet movement is called

for, hal ings sometimes wear oiled leather or soft fabrics to

avoid making noise. Hal ings living in large cities where

another race predominates may adopt some aspects of the

other races style, but they still prefer brighter colors than

most other humanoids.

GROOMING

Hal ings encountered on the road are as dusty as any other

travelers,  but  they  are  quite  fastidious  about  bathing  and

grooming when the chance presents itself. A hal ing caravan

may  move  for  days  before  encountering  a  river  or  lake  in

which to bathe, but when one appears, the weary inhabitants

of the wagons invariably camp and clean themselves up.

Water jugs are carried in all halfling wagons, both for

drinking and for sponge baths on the road. A few hal ing

travelers have rigged ingenious pump-and-sprinkler systems

that provide crude showers. Still, such measures are a far

cry from the pleasure of a bath in crystal waters. Males and

females establish separate bathing areas when they camp

near water, but several members of the same gender may

bathe together.

Hal ings make a crude form of soap from rendered animal

fat  and  natural  minerals.  This  soap  works  fine  for  both

bathing and washing clothes, but it tends to be rather harsh.

Thus, hal ings often trade for better-quality soap with more

settled races.

Whether or not water is available, hal ings unbind their

hair every night and comb out the days tangles. Such groom-

ing is often a shared ritual between lovers or family members,

who chat and exchange stories of the day while combing one

anothers hair.

Clothes are changed daily, when possible, and washed

whenever a water source is found. Most hal ings also take

good care of their boots, because top-quality footgear can

prevent injuries for those who travel much.

Some hal ings sport tattoos as a form of personal decora-

tion, but most avoid them because tattoos make an individual

instantly recognizable. The last thing a typical halfling

wants is to have a face that anyone can identify just from

the description of a tattoo. Though the  amboyant clothing

of hal ings is also recognizable, it often serves to confound

pursuers in search of thieves because it can be changed or

discarded quickly. Body piercings, especially on the ears and

eyebrows, are slightly more common than tattoos.

PSYCHOLOGY

The call of the open road is music to a hal ings ears. Though

the traveling life poses many hardships, most hal ings endure

them cheerfully for the bene t of the freedom that having no

permanent home affords. They can camp wherever they  nd

a safe place, stay as long as they wish, then pack up and move

on when the urge strikes them. What could be better?

A HARD-WORKING PEOPLE

The majority of hal ings live in caravans that travel about

the countryside, camping here and there for varying amounts

of time before moving on. When a hal ing caravan camps

in or near a community of other humanoids, the hal ings

take care to make their stay as bene cial as possible to the

settled people. Able-bodied adult hal ings hire themselves

out as temporary laborers, working for pay at any job from

building to farming. They also offer a variety of services to any

town near their encampment, working as cobblers, tinkers,

peddlers, brewers, weavers, or whatever kind of crafters the

town may lack at the time. Such an arrangement can continue

for a few weeks, or even a few years, before the hal ings pack

up their camp and move on.

Hal ings also tend to distribute favors liberally within a

nearby community, knowing that should any trouble arise,

they will have plenty of staunch supporters to defend them

from unfounded (or even founded) accusations. Such favors

can  take  the  form  of  aid  to  people  in  need,  discounts  on

services for those who have little to spend, and small gifts to

people who have treated them especially kindlyor unkindly.

In this way, hal ings make themselves welcome wherever

they choose to camp.

Halflings who work for pay treat the income they receive

carefully, feeding their families first and squirreling away

the  rest  of  their  spoils  in  their  wagons  until  they  can

cache it in a secure placepreferably with a trustworthy

settled halfling.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAW

Owning  only  a  minimal  amount  of  property  themselves

leads hal ings  to look at others possessions differently from

the way that most races do. To many hal ings, the property

of  others  is  but  another  resource  that  they  can  exploit.

They can earn it with honest labor, trade for it, or mine it

for themselvesby stealing. Of course, each hal ing is an

individual; some  nd it easiest to be scrupulously honest,

while a few are thoroughly dishonest. Most, however, have

just a trace of larceny in their souls. When they need food or

money and have no easy way of obtaining it, they feel free to

help themselves to the goods of those who, in their opinion,

have more than they need.

They are also happy to

cheat others out of their wealth by

various means. Every classic con dence scamfrom

the old shell game to hawking fake love potions to selling

land they dont ownis perpetrated by most hal ing clans

on outsiders at some time. To the hal ings way of think-

ing, someone foolish enough to think that anyone can get

something for nothing deserves to get nothing for something.

Nevertheless,  hal ings  always  ensure  that  some  of  their

transactions are real and honest, and that some customers

actually pro t from dealings with them. Then, should those

they have cheated actually discover the duplicity, plenty of

other people will be available to defend  the hal ings and

obscure the issue until they can escape.

Hal ings who appropriate the property of others or cheat

customers realize that they are breaking local laws and that

such practices do not endear them to their neighbors. But

as long as they dont get caught and no one comes to harm

from such an incident, they do not consider it wrong. After

all, from the hal ings viewpoint, the world really does owe

them a living.

This free and easy attitude regarding others belongings,

combined with hal ings innate charm and willingness to

help, causes other races to regard them with a mixture of

doubt, exasperation, and bemusement. A town heavily dam-

aged by  oods or storms may welcome the aid of a hal ing

caravan  while  rebuilding,  then  become  cold  toward  the

hal ings when the crisis is over. The hal ings understand

such shifts in attitude and move along when it is clear they

are no longer wanted, taking care never to burn their bridges

or give a town actual cause to hate their kind. It is always to

the bene t of any group of hal ings to ensure that future

caravans to visit a town will be welcomed, because one of

those caravans might be their own.

PERSONAL EXPRESSION

Though they are less fiercely individualistic than elves,

halflings do feel a strong need for personal expression.

Their choice of clothing re ects this attitude, as does their

enjoyment  of  various  arts  and  crafts.  Halflings  usually

speak their minds openly. A halfling who disagrees with

someone elses statement nearly always says sousually

politely, though a heated argument can lead some to forget

their manners. Halflings freely express their emotions

within their own communities, though their experience

with duplicity prompts them to temper their reactions when

dealing with other races.

Personal privacy is almost nonexistent in a caravan. A whole

family usually dwells in each wagon, and neighbors can change

from day to day, depending on how the camp is arranged.

Conversations in one wagon can rarely be overheard in another

while on the road, but such is not always the case at a campsite.

Thus, everyone tends to know everyone elses business, and

anyone feels free to offer advice to anyone else.

Personal space is likewise almost nonexistent. Hal ings

constantly wander in and out of one anothers dwellings to

chat  or  examine  each  others  belongings.  Sometimes  the

stories of how certain objects came into the possession of a

scarves or large hats to keep the sun from their eyes. Jewelry,

the  brighter  the  better,  is  popular  with  both  males  and

females, and any hal ing may wear earrings, one or more

necklaces, bracelets, or rings, and hair ornaments at the same

time, with little regard for how the accessories look together.

ored glass, wooden beadwork, or hammered gold or silver set

building to farming. They also offer a variety of services to any

town near their encampment, working as cobblers, tinkers,

peddlers, brewers, weavers, or whatever kind of crafters the

town may lack at the time. Such an arrangement can continue

for a few weeks, or even a few years, before the hal ings pack

up their camp and move on.

Hal ings also tend to distribute favors liberally within a

nearby community, knowing that should any trouble arise,

they will have plenty of staunch supporters to defend them

from unfounded (or even founded) accusations. Such favors

constantly wander in and out of one anothers dwellings to

chat  or  examine  each  others  belongings.  Sometimes  the

stories of how certain objects came into the possession of a

haling can take hours to tell and provide entertainment

for a whole clan.

THE SHORT-TERM VIEW

Though  halings  have  longer  life  spans  than  humans  do,

they are still short-lived creatures compared to races such as

the elves. Thus, halings tend to take a short-term view in

much the same way that humans do. They are, however, more

careful to ensure their future welcome than humans tend to

be, and more careful with the environment than half-orcs are.

Still, halings take no pains to ensure the sustainability of

their communities because they rarely stay in one place for

long. They take what they can from the environment, and

then simply leave should it become unable to support them.

They do not plant trees to replace those they have cut, or sow

crops to replace those they eat. Halings take no more from

the land than they need and leave it to nature to restore any

area they have used.

OPENNESS AND SECRECY

Halings are known for their gregarious nature and open,

friendly attitude toward strangers. Unless he or she presents

an obvious danger, a traveler of any race approaching a half-

ling camp or settlement can expect a hearty welcome and

an invitation to share re, food, and ale. Such impromptu

meetings are usually replete with stories, songs, and merri-

ment. Reecting on the conversation later, however, a stranger

may come to realize that the halings said almost nothing

of importance about themselves. In fact, almost anyone who

has extended contact with halings has a nagging sense that

they are holding something back.

Halflings have developed content-free conversation to

a fine art. Although they speak readily and openly with

strangers about most topics, they artfully turn aside questions

from outsiders about their clans, homes, customs, families,

and other personal matters. Such secrecy has developed in

halings over many generations as a defense mechanism

to prevent disgruntled clients and enemies from tracking

down specic halings. Though a haling may spin a long

and amusing tale about a hapless relative, the listeners are

often amazed to realize later that they have no clue at all about

how to nd or identify the person who was lampooned in

the story.

HALFLING TRAITS

Part of the reason why halings prefer to spend their lives

on the road is their unagging curiosity. They simply must

see whats around the next bendand the next, and the

next, and the next. A haling greets each new day with

an  excitement  rarely  found  among  humans  because  she

recognizes it as a new opportunity for adventureand an

opportunity not seized is an opportunity lost. Halings

are cunning enough to recognize tricks the majority of the

time and are rarely taken in by them, but even so, many go

along with a trick anyway, just to see whats coming next. A

haling cant stand the idea of an unexplored cave, a closed

door, or a locked chesthe simply has to see whats inside.

Poking  his  nose  into  places  he  hasnt  been  invited  may

sometimes be a mistake; at other times, doing so might bring

wealth, new friends, or opportunities for adventure. Indeed,

halings prefer activity to waiting and trouble to boredom

because doing something is always more interesting than

doing nothing.

Though halings do not act stupidly when danger threatens,

they exhibit little fear of death or the unknown. Death is but

the next great adventure, and the unknown is just as likely to

contain fabulous riches as grave danger. This combination of

curiosity and fearlessness makes them difcult companions

for those of more careful races. Often the  members of an

adventuring  party  nd  that  while  they  have  been  talking

about options, their haling companion has already opened

a door and made their discussion moot.

Despite their apparently impulsive nature, halings can

focus intently on tasks requiring concentration. Whether she

is mending a weapon at a forge or picking a lock, a halings

focus on a task she wants to accomplish is as strong as that

of any other race.

A high level of activity is characteristic of most halings.

Charged with energy, they can barely sit still. Restlessness

seems  to  radiate  from  their  bodies,  and  they  are  prone  to

twitching, dgeting, and other physical indications of the

need to move about. Halings who embrace the path of the

rogue learn to mediate such responses to a degree for the

purpose of stealth, but most retain their zest for activity

throughout their lives.

Though they are not overly greedy, halings enjoy accumu-

lating wealth just as much as humans do. They spend little

of what they amass, preferring to save most of it to ensure a

comfortable retirement or a steady supply of food for their

families. Still, they enjoy the sight of gems, the gleam of

gold, and especially the joy of nding out what a new magic

item does. Many halings incorporate magic items they have

found into entertainment for their clans, creating illusions

or disappearing into thin air at just the right moment.

Halings are mindful of the needs of the group as well

as those of the individual; neither is more important all the

time. Sometimes an individuals needs must outweigh those

of the group, especially if the person is deserving or talented.

At other times, the clans welfare takes precedence. Halings

have a talent for evaluating situations and making judgments

without being hampered by the prejudices that the clannish

dwarves or the self-indulgent elves commonly display.

The highest virtues for a haling are an adventurous spirit,

a willingness to work, and a strong commitment to family

and friends. Halings who go adventuring are considered

heroes because they bring back both wealth andmore

importantlystories.

Roleplaying Application: Halings are well suited for

adventuring, given their wanderlust, their curiosity, their lack

of fear, and their strong need for new experiences. Halings

who leave their clans to adventure are not only welcomed

back but celebrated as heroes when they return.

Halflings  are  usually  pleasant  traveling  companions,

though their penchant for trouble tends to cause occasional

annoyance in their companions. However, they understand

how adventuring parties must work together, and they are

quite  able  to  respond  to  threats  against  their  companions

without becoming distracted.

Though all halings are curious, active, trouble-prone, and

fearless, other aspects of an individual character require some

denition. What is your characters personality like? Does

she come from a caravan or a settlement? How do her friends

and family back home view her? Does she feel the need to

prove herself, or is she just out for treasure and adventure?

HALFLING LIFE

Most outsiders believe that halings lead a happy-go-lucky

life, free from cares and responsibilities. As is often the case,

however, the truth is quite different. Though having minimal

possessions does avoid many of the problems faced by more

settled folk, halings must endure cold, rainy nights, hunger

when food is scarce, attack by monsters in the wilderness,

wagons stuck in the mud, rocky trails, and a general lack of

privacy. The fact that they can face such difculties and still

wear the carefree smiles that most people associate with them

is a tribute to the haling spirit.

Haling culture is not as old or as developed as that of the

elves, but its diversity provides a richness of its own. Like a

quilt sewn by many hands, haling culture is a patchwork

of different styles, arts, and attitudes. Though most halings

espouse the same general principles, each caravan (or sail-

ing  ship,  for  seafaring  halings)  forms  a  subculture  of  its

own,  with  particu-

lar customs, rules

of behavior, rituals,

and  even  speech

patterns.  Halings

recognize  this  diver-

sity  and  are  always

eager to learn the cus-

toms of others of their

kind. The constant

turnover  among

the people in a giv-

en caravan ensures

that  each  subcul-

ture continues to

grow and evolve.

Most  halings

adopt  noncombat

professions  such  as

blacksmith, animal herder,

or some other function within

the caravan. A high percentage leave

the caravan at some point to take up adventuring. The halings

need to see whats around the next bend or behind the next

door is never served as well as in an adventuring career.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Like  humans  and  dwarves,  halings  usually  specialize  in

crafts and professions, with each person occupying a neces-

sary  niche  in  the  community  and  providing  a  particular

service throughout his life. Each caravan has a blacksmith,

a wheelwright, a wagon builder, a butcher, various cooks,

hunters, animal trainers, spinners, weavers, priests, tinkers,

jewelers, and general laborers. Nearly all haling NPCs in

a  caravan  specialize  in  one  primary  skill  and  take  one  or

two ranks in several others that they have developed in case

someone needs to ll in for another member of the caravan

who has become ill or disabled. Such secondary skills also

stand  halings  in  good  stead  when  they  camp  near  other

humanoid communities and hire themselves out.

Crafts are the primary outlet for a halings creative side.

Halings create very little art for its own sake; there is usually

little money in such endeavors. Why spend weeks making a

lovely painting or statue that will have to be carried around

for months and months, taking up valuable space in someones

wagon? Better to carve and paint childrens toys and sell them

at the next stop. Halings do, however, enjoy embellishing

the items they use in daily life. Some paint designs of remark-

able beauty on the sides of their wagons; others make jewelry

or embroider clothing for their own use. Such use of ones

creative abilities is benecial to both the individual and the

community. Brightly colored wagons can draw attention from

other humanoids, attracting them to the camp, so the halings

can  easily  transact  business  with  them.  Likewise,  striking

clothing and jewelry sometimes speaks more of prosperity

than of a vagabond lifestyle, which tends to put more stable

businesspeople at ease.

THE SHORT-TERM VIEW

Though  halings  have  longer  life  spans  than  humans  do,

they are still short-lived creatures compared to races such as

the elves. Thus, halings tend to take a short-term view in

much the same way that humans do. They are, however, more

careful to ensure their future welcome than humans tend to

be, and more careful with the environment than half-orcs are.

Still, halings take no pains to ensure the sustainability of

their communities because they rarely stay in one place for

long. They take what they can from the environment, and

then simply leave should it become unable to support them.

They do not plant trees to replace those they have cut, or sow

crops to replace those they eat. Halings take no more from

the land than they need and leave it to nature to restore any

area they have used.

OPENNESS AND SECRECY

Halings are known for their gregarious nature and open,

friendly attitude toward strangers. Unless he or she presents

an obvious danger, a traveler of any race approaching a half-

ling camp or settlement can expect a hearty welcome and

an invitation to share re, food, and ale. Such impromptu

meetings are usually replete with stories, songs, and merri-

ment. Reecting on the conversation later, however, a stranger

may come to realize that the halings said almost nothing

of importance about themselves. In fact, almost anyone who

has extended contact with halings has a nagging sense that

they are holding something back.

Halflings have developed content-free conversation to

a fine art. Although they speak readily and openly with

strangers about most topics, they artfully turn aside questions

from outsiders about their clans, homes, customs, families,

and other personal matters. Such secrecy has developed in

halings over many generations as a defense mechanism

to prevent disgruntled clients and enemies from tracking

down specic halings. Though a haling may spin a long

and amusing tale about a hapless relative, the listeners are

often amazed to realize later that they have no clue at all about

how to nd or identify the person who was lampooned in

the story.

HALFLING TRAITS

Part of the reason why halings prefer to spend their lives

on the road is their unagging curiosity. They simply must

see whats around the next bendand the next, and the

next, and the next. A haling greets each new day with

an  excitement  rarely  found  among  humans  because  she

recognizes it as a new opportunity for adventureand an

opportunity not seized is an opportunity lost. Halings

are cunning enough to recognize tricks the majority of the

time and are rarely taken in by them, but even so, many go

along with a trick anyway, just to see whats coming next. A

haling cant stand the idea of an unexplored cave, a closed

door, or a locked chesthe simply has to see whats inside.

Poking  his  nose  into  places  he  hasnt  been  invited  may

sometimes be a mistake; at other times, doing so might bring

wealth, new friends, or opportunities for adventure. Indeed,

halings prefer activity to waiting and trouble to boredom

because doing something is always more interesting than

doing nothing.

Though halings do not act stupidly when danger threatens,

they exhibit little fear of death or the unknown. Death is but

the next great adventure, and the unknown is just as likely to

contain fabulous riches as grave danger. This combination of

curiosity and fearlessness makes them difcult companions

for those of more careful races. Often the  members of an

adventuring  party  nd  that  while  they  have  been  talking

about options, their haling companion has already opened

a door and made their discussion moot.

Despite their apparently impulsive nature, halings can

focus intently on tasks requiring concentration. Whether she

is mending a weapon at a forge or picking a lock, a halings

focus on a task she wants to accomplish is as strong as that

of any other race.

A high level of activity is characteristic of most halings.

Charged with energy, they can barely sit still. Restlessness

seems  to  radiate  from  their  bodies,  and  they  are  prone  to

twitching, dgeting, and other physical indications of the

need to move about. Halings who embrace the path of the

rogue learn to mediate such responses to a degree for the

purpose of stealth, but most retain their zest for activity

throughout their lives.

Though they are not overly greedy, halings enjoy accumu-

lating wealth just as much as humans do. They spend little

of what they amass, preferring to save most of it to ensure a

comfortable retirement or a steady supply of food for their

families. Still, they enjoy the sight of gems, the gleam of

gold, and especially the joy of nding out what a new magic

item does. Many halings incorporate magic items they have

found into entertainment for their clans, creating illusions

or disappearing into thin air at just the right moment.

Halings are mindful of the needs of the group as well

as those of the individual; neither is more important all the

time. Sometimes an individuals needs must outweigh those

of the group, especially if the person is deserving or talented.

At other times, the clans welfare takes precedence. Halings

have a talent for evaluating situations and making judgments

without being hampered by the prejudices that the clannish

dwarves or the self-indulgent elves commonly display.

The highest virtues for a haling are an adventurous spirit,

a willingness to work, and a strong commitment to family

and friends. Halings who go adventuring are considered

heroes because they bring back both wealth andmore

importantlystories.

Roleplaying Application: Halings are well suited for

adventuring, given their wanderlust, their curiosity, their lack

of fear, and their strong need for new experiences. Halings

who leave their clans to adventure are not only welcomed

back but celebrated as heroes when they return.

Halflings  are  usually  pleasant  traveling  companions,

though their penchant for trouble tends to cause occasional

annoyance in their companions. However, they understand

how adventuring parties must work together, and they are

quite  able  to  respond  to  threats  against  their  companions

without becoming distracted.

Though all halings are curious, active, trouble-prone, and

fearless, other aspects of an individual character require some

denition. What is your characters personality like? Does

she come from a caravan or a settlement? How do her friends

and family back home view her? Does she feel the need to

prove herself, or is she just out for treasure and adventure?

HALFLING LIFE

Most outsiders believe that halings lead a happy-go-lucky

life, free from cares and responsibilities. As is often the case,

however, the truth is quite different. Though having minimal

possessions does avoid many of the problems faced by more

settled folk, halings must endure cold, rainy nights, hunger

when food is scarce, attack by monsters in the wilderness,

wagons stuck in the mud, rocky trails, and a general lack of

privacy. The fact that they can face such difculties and still

wear the carefree smiles that most people associate with them

is a tribute to the haling spirit.

43

A haling merchant uses her wagon to display her craftwork

does a haling go without his music. Someone in the camp

is almost always playing a tune, and while the caravan is on

the road, singing, whistling, and humming make the trip

more pleasant. Favored instruments among halings include

lutes, lyres, horns, and small drums, as well as more exotic

string and percussion instruments acquired at some point

in their travels. Their best-known compositions are merry

tunes  that  draw  listeners  into  dancing.  Among  their  own

people, however, songs of the open road and laments for the

departed that can draw a tear from even the most stoic eye

are equally prized.

Though most halings have a talent for acting, they pro-

duce very few plays because such forms of entertainment

tend to consume resources while doing little to mend wagons,

accrue wealth, or cook dinner. Impromptu skits, however, are

quite popular within certain caravans, and less than attering

representations of other races often add to the frivolity.

Among the most important arts in a haling community

is storytelling. Halings write down practical information,

such as supply lists and transaction records, but they rarely

take the time to record legends or gossip. The oral tradition

is stronger in the haling race than almost any other, and

almost every haling is an accomplished storyteller. Telling

tales around the campre has been a tradition among travel-

ing halings for as long as anyone can remember, and the

frequent turnover in caravan personnel ensures that there

are always new tales to hear. Though in many cases the tales

amount to little more than gossip, word of important events

spreads quickly through the haling race from caravan to

caravan. Halings have a deep respect for the oral tradition

and  thus  attach  an  absolute  minimum  of  embellishment

to the original tales. Thus, a tale spread from one end of a

continent to the other will be substantially the same as when

it was rst told.

Several times each year, a number of caravans gather in

a  prearranged  location  for  a  storytelling  fair.  They  hold

contests for the best tales and the best renderings, and they

present cash prizes as well as accolades to the winners. These

week-long events also feature craft booths, trained animal

acts, feasting, and other forms of entertainment. Outsiders

are welcome, but few ever attend, put off by the prospect of

so many thieves and con artists gathered in one place.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Most halings believe that magic is great for driving off

orcs, entertaining outsiders, and dealing with the occasional

emergency. In the long run, though, technology is often

more practical and more reproducible. After all, just about

everyone who makes a wagon wheel goes about it the same

way, and if you studied a wagon wheel long enough, you could

probably get a good idea of how to make one. In contrast, two

spellcasters may cast the same spell in entirely different ways,

and no onenot even experienced wizardscan gure out

how to reproduce a spell just by seeing its effect.

The study of magic is a niche activity in haling communi-

ties. Everyone appreciates having a few wizards, sorcerers,

and  clerics  around  for  emergencies,  but  their  usefulness

is limited in daily life. Magic items, however, are another

matter  entirely.  With  only  minimal  instruction,  anyone

can use many items of power; those that are not needed can

be sold for good prices. Thus, spellcasters who travel with

haling caravans often nd themselves pressured to either

create magic items or nd something productive to do with

their time. Most halings who pursue such classes also have

other professions that are more useful to the community on

a day-to-day basis.

Haling spellcasters rarely do research, and they display

a preference for magic of the illusion, transmutation, and

conjuration schools. Abjurers and diviners are also relatively

common, while necromancers are practically unknown. Arcane

spellcasters usually travel with their clans, but each usually

has a wagon of his own; most halings nd it prudent to give

wizards and sorcerers a wide berth in case of accidents.

Haling technology focuses primarily on practical items

and transportation. Small, portable items are favored so that

they can easily be carried in wagons or on ones person. Any

item that makes daily life easier or can get a caravan out of

trouble is of great interest to a haling band. Heavy, bulky

items and equipment are of little interest to halings unless

they can see a way to sell such items at a handsome prot.

The legend that claims halings invented horseshoes is

probably false; halings use goats more often than horses.

Still, that bit of lore does speak to the depth of the halings

passion  for  transportation-related  equipment.  Goat  carts,

oxcarts, mine cars, boats, gliders, and all other kinds of con-

veyances are fascinating to halings, and they have improved

on most of the traditional designs.

Animal  breeding  and  training  is  also  an  essential  part

of haling technology because animals power many of the

halings  conveyances  and  provide  food  for  the  caravan.

Halings  have  developed  breeding  to  a  science  and  can

reliably produce animals with more meat, greater speed, or

more endurance than those raised by most other races.

Upgrades in transportation, food preservation, medicines

and tonics, and other technology of interest are quickly passed

from one caravan to anotherand to human, dwarf, gnome,

and elf communities as well. Even technology that did not

originate among the halings spreads quickly once they get

hold of it.

LOVE

Love is a vital part of life, and halings enjoy it to the fullest.

They  are  devoted  to  their  families;  the  affection  between

children and parents, siblings, spouses, and extended family

members  such  as  grandparents  and  cousins  is  deep  and

unyielding. So great is the haling devotion to family that

two halings who meet for the rst time are likely to spend

hours comparing genealogies to gure out how they might

be related. Should a familial relationship be discovered, no

matter how remote, the two treat one another like long-lost

siblingsat  least  until  one  does  something  perfidious

enough to sour the relationship.

Halings are as eager to experience romantic love as any

other  humanoids.  To  them,  romance  is  just  another  great

adventure that may bring weal or woe. Infatuation is common

among halings, and since offspring frequently result from

such  liaisons,  lovers  typically  formalize  their  relation-

ships as soon as possible. Romantic relationships between

members of the same caravan or clan are discouraged but

not strictly forbidden.

Two  levels  of  marriage  exist  within  haling  society.

Handfasting is the most common method of formalizing

a relationship within a haling community. Only the two

lovers and three witnesses of their choice need be present

to complete this ritual. The lovers hands are usually bound

together with leather thongs; these are removed, knotted

together,  and  presented  to  the  couple  at  the  end  of  the

ceremony. The lovers speak their own vows, which usually

consist of a promise to look out for one anothers welfare and

remain faithful for as long as love lasts. Handfasted couples

are entitled to their own wagons. If neither party already

owns a wagon, one is built by the community at the earliest

opportunity and presented to the couple as a gift. Until then,

such a couple usually lives in the wagon of one or the others

parents. Handfasted couples are expected to live and work

together as long as they feel affection for one another.

Some handfastings last for decades, and a few last for

life. Often, though, because halings are intensely curious

creatures, one partner becomes interested in someone else,

or perhaps one wishes to leave for an extended period to go

adventuring or join another caravan; and sometimes argu-

ments simply poison the couples love. In such cases, couples

can end their handfasting with a brief ceremony in which the

knotted cords they received earlier are untied before three

witnesses  and  presented  to  the  now-separate  individuals.

Children of such a couple live with whichever parent wants

them. If both do, a child can choose if he or she is old enough

to speak; younger offspring remain with their mother unless

she refuses them.

The second level of formalization is true marriage. Mar-

riages are much rarer than handfastings and cannot occur

between members of the same clan. Most marriages occur

much later in life than handfastings, after the lovers have

had a chance to live together as a handfasted couple and

become certain of their love. Some couples never take this

step at all, content to remain handfasted for their entire lives.

A marriage is conducted by a cleric and sparks a week of

celebration in the entire community. Most married couples

already have wagons, but those who do not receive them

from the community, just as handfasted couples do. A newly

married couple is showered with gifts, and both husband

and wife are instantly accorded the position of elders within

the community.

The primary difference between a wedding and a handfast-

ing is that a wedding is for life. The halings involved may

not dissolve the union, and any attempts to separate or stray

result in the expulsion of the guilty party or parties from the

community. Thus, marriage occurs only between halings

who are quite certain of their ability to weather the storms of

a relationship. Though true marriages occasionally go sour,

the parties usually learn to resolve their differences and live

together in (relative) harmony.

Reproduction

Halings reach maturity at the age of 20, and both genders are

capable of reproduction for approximately 40 years thereafter.

The gestation period is seven months, a little shorter than that

of a human. Female halings rarely give up working, adven-

turing, or pursuing their usual activities while pregnant, at

least until the last month or so. Halings with infants or

very young children often choose to halt their roaming for

a few seasons, picking a good camp or a permanent haling

settlement (or even a human town) until the youngsters are

a little older. Not all roaming halings do this, though; some

families never leave their caravans.

Halings are adept at avoiding trouble, and halings with

small children especially so. Despite the perils of disease,

weather, monsters, and orc raids, roughly eight in ten children

reach maturity.

HALFLINGS AT WAR

Halings rarely declare war on othersafter all, winning

might mean becoming tied down with property. In the same

way, having no lands and few goods of their own means that

halings have little need to defend their belongings. No one

starts a war just to take a few dozen wagons, though other

races may ght long and bloody conicts over pieces of land

that are often quite small. Having little to lose and no interest

in a permanent home frees a haling to enjoy life in ways

that other races can never appreciate.

Halings are certainly not pacists, however, and often

nd work as mercenaries in the wars of others. Their small

size and aptitude for sneaking makes them excellent scouts,

and  their  high  Dexterity  and  racial  bonus  with  thrown

weapons makes them valuable in units employing ranged

weapons. Though halings have no fear of melee combat,

they are prudent enough to avoid it when possible. Haling

infantry units are rare, though haling cavalry can be surpris-

ingly effective due to the halings aptitude with animals and

their penchant for doing the unexpected on the battleeld.

All halings learn to use slings and javelins well before they

reach maturity. Many also learn how to use short swords and

throwing axes, as well as certain exotic haling weapons such

as skiprocks and war slings. A halings rst line of defense is

usually a ranged weapon. Should an enemy get close enough

for melee combat, the longsword or short sword is the most

common choice.

DEATH

The much-vaunted haling fearlessness extends even to

death. Most halings view death as simply the next great

adventure. Though they do not court it, they take no pains to

avoid risk, nor do they resort to necromancy or other magical

means to stave off death.

spellcasters usually travel with their clans, but each usually

has a wagon of his own; most halings nd it prudent to give

wizards and sorcerers a wide berth in case of accidents.

Haling technology focuses primarily on practical items

and transportation. Small, portable items are favored so that

they can easily be carried in wagons or on ones person. Any

item that makes daily life easier or can get a caravan out of

trouble is of great interest to a haling band. Heavy, bulky

items and equipment are of little interest to halings unless

they can see a way to sell such items at a handsome prot.

The legend that claims halings invented horseshoes is

probably false; halings use goats more often than horses.

Still, that bit of lore does speak to the depth of the halings

passion  for  transportation-related  equipment.  Goat  carts,

oxcarts, mine cars, boats, gliders, and all other kinds of con-

veyances are fascinating to halings, and they have improved

on most of the traditional designs.

Animal  breeding  and  training  is  also  an  essential  part

of haling technology because animals power many of the

halings  conveyances  and  provide  food  for  the  caravan.

Halings  have  developed  breeding  to  a  science  and  can

reliably produce animals with more meat, greater speed, or

more endurance than those raised by most other races.

Upgrades in transportation, food preservation, medicines

and tonics, and other technology of interest are quickly passed

from one caravan to anotherand to human, dwarf, gnome,

and elf communities as well. Even technology that did not

originate among the halings spreads quickly once they get

hold of it.

LOVE

Love is a vital part of life, and halings enjoy it to the fullest.

They  are  devoted  to  their  families;  the  affection  between

children and parents, siblings, spouses, and extended family

members  such  as  grandparents  and  cousins  is  deep  and

unyielding. So great is the haling devotion to family that

two halings who meet for the rst time are likely to spend

hours comparing genealogies to gure out how they might

be related. Should a familial relationship be discovered, no

matter how remote, the two treat one another like long-lost

siblingsat  least  until  one  does  something  perfidious

enough to sour the relationship.

Halings are as eager to experience romantic love as any

other  humanoids.  To  them,  romance  is  just  another  great

adventure that may bring weal or woe. Infatuation is common

among halings, and since offspring frequently result from

such  liaisons,  lovers  typically  formalize  their  relation-

ships as soon as possible. Romantic relationships between

members of the same caravan or clan are discouraged but

not strictly forbidden.

Two  levels  of  marriage  exist  within  haling  society.

Handfasting is the most common method of formalizing

a relationship within a haling community. Only the two

lovers and three witnesses of their choice need be present

to complete this ritual. The lovers hands are usually bound

together with leather thongs; these are removed, knotted

together,  and  presented  to  the  couple  at  the  end  of  the

ceremony. The lovers speak their own vows, which usually

consist of a promise to look out for one anothers welfare and

remain faithful for as long as love lasts. Handfasted couples

are entitled to their own wagons. If neither party already

owns a wagon, one is built by the community at the earliest

opportunity and presented to the couple as a gift. Until then,

such a couple usually lives in the wagon of one or the others

parents. Handfasted couples are expected to live and work

together as long as they feel affection for one another.

Some handfastings last for decades, and a few last for

life. Often, though, because halings are intensely curious

creatures, one partner becomes interested in someone else,

or perhaps one wishes to leave for an extended period to go

adventuring or join another caravan; and sometimes argu-

ments simply poison the couples love. In such cases, couples

can end their handfasting with a brief ceremony in which the

knotted cords they received earlier are untied before three

witnesses  and  presented  to  the  now-separate  individuals.

Children of such a couple live with whichever parent wants

them. If both do, a child can choose if he or she is old enough

to speak; younger offspring remain with their mother unless

she refuses them.

The second level of formalization is true marriage. Mar-

riages are much rarer than handfastings and cannot occur

between members of the same clan. Most marriages occur

much later in life than handfastings, after the lovers have

had a chance to live together as a handfasted couple and

become certain of their love. Some couples never take this

step at all, content to remain handfasted for their entire lives.

A marriage is conducted by a cleric and sparks a week of

celebration in the entire community. Most married couples

already have wagons, but those who do not receive them

from the community, just as handfasted couples do. A newly

married couple is showered with gifts, and both husband

and wife are instantly accorded the position of elders within

the community.

The primary difference between a wedding and a handfast-

ing is that a wedding is for life. The halings involved may

not dissolve the union, and any attempts to separate or stray

result in the expulsion of the guilty party or parties from the

community. Thus, marriage occurs only between halings

who are quite certain of their ability to weather the storms of

a relationship. Though true marriages occasionally go sour,

the parties usually learn to resolve their differences and live

together in (relative) harmony.

Reproduction

Halings reach maturity at the age of 20, and both genders are

capable of reproduction for approximately 40 years thereafter.

The gestation period is seven months, a little shorter than that

of a human. Female halings rarely give up working, adven-

turing, or pursuing their usual activities while pregnant, at

least until the last month or so. Halings with infants or

very young children often choose to halt their roaming for

a few seasons, picking a good camp or a permanent haling

settlement (or even a human town) until the youngsters are

a little older. Not all roaming halings do this, though; some

families never leave their caravans.

Halings are adept at avoiding trouble, and halings with

small children especially so. Despite the perils of disease,

weather, monsters, and orc raids, roughly eight in ten children

reach maturity.

HALFLINGS AT WAR

Halings rarely declare war on othersafter all, winning

might mean becoming tied down with property. In the same

way, having no lands and few goods of their own means that

halings have little need to defend their belongings. No one

starts a war just to take a few dozen wagons, though other

races may ght long and bloody conicts over pieces of land

that are often quite small. Having little to lose and no interest

in a permanent home frees a haling to enjoy life in ways

that other races can never appreciate.

Halings are certainly not pacists, however, and often

nd work as mercenaries in the wars of others. Their small

size and aptitude for sneaking makes them excellent scouts,

and  their  high  Dexterity  and  racial  bonus  with  thrown

weapons makes them valuable in units employing ranged

weapons. Though halings have no fear of melee combat,

they are prudent enough to avoid it when possible. Haling

infantry units are rare, though haling cavalry can be surpris-

ingly effective due to the halings aptitude with animals and

their penchant for doing the unexpected on the battleeld.

All halings learn to use slings and javelins well before they

reach maturity. Many also learn how to use short swords and

throwing axes, as well as certain exotic haling weapons such

as skiprocks and war slings. A halings rst line of defense is

usually a ranged weapon. Should an enemy get close enough

for melee combat, the longsword or short sword is the most

common choice.

DEATH

The much-vaunted haling fearlessness extends even to

death. Most halings view death as simply the next great

adventure. Though they do not court it, they take no pains to

avoid risk, nor do they resort to necromancy or other magical

means to stave off death.

Haling  caravans  hold  funerals  to  mourn  the  loss  of

companions and also to celebrate their next great journey.

Thus, a funeral usually has two parts: a grieving ceremony

followed  by  a  party.  During  the  grieving  portion  of  the

funeral,  the  entire  community  gives  vent  to  sorrow.  The

object of this portion of the ritual is to cleanse the souls of

those left behind of their grief so that they can move on, both

literally and guratively. After all members of the caravan

have cried as long as they need to, they sleep, then awaken

and begin the celebration. Tables are set up with places for

everyone, including an empty spot for the deceased. They

roast meat, pile baked goods of all sorts on crude wooden

tables, and tap barrels of wine and ale. Everyone eats, drinks,

and dances. From time to time, someone stands up and tells

a story (often humorous) involving the deceased, and tales of

his life are woven into stories to add to the general tapestry of

oral tradition that ties all halings together. The storytelling

and feasting lasts until everyone has fallen asleep, usually a

full day and night.

After the party ends, the body of the deceased, if present,

is brought to a funeral pyre built of branches and twigs

and  set  alight.  His  ashes  are  then  scattered  to  the  four

winds, so that he might continue his journey unfettered.

The goods of the deceased are distributed to the remaining

members of his family or, if no immediate family is present,

to his clan.

If a funeral is held for a haling who later turns up alive,

he must take another name because his original identity has

been laid to rest. Even if everyone knows who he is, he must

begin again as a new member of the caravan and his clan.

HALFLING SOCIETY

AND CULTURE

For the most part, halings lay no claim to any land, build

no permanent dwellings, and grow no crops. They func-

tion  as  permanent  guests  in  the  world,  moving  from  one

community  to  another,  enjoying  the  hospitality  of  any

friends  they  nd,  and  moving  along  when  they  wear  out

their welcome. They carry with them only what ts in their

wagons, and they live off the land when no other means of

support presents itself.

Some halings do purchase land or homes and settle down

for a time, but these individuals rarely live out their lives in

one spot. After a year or two the family moves on, taking to

the road again or seeking a new home in a different settle-

ment. Halings who settle down to stay are rare indeed,

usually elderly folk who have seen all they wish to see and

want only a comfortable retirement. Some settled halings

allow others of their kind to camp on their land and help farm

it whenever they pass through. Others settle in cities and

provide safe houses for halings who are in trouble with the

law. Whatever their dwellings, settled halings often serve

as fences or bankers for other halings; they provide a safe

place to cache accumulated wealth so the owner doesnt have

to carry it and risk losing it to brigands.

Permanent haling communities are generally found in

the lands of other races, and their populations turn over with

some regularity. Such communities offer services to traveling

halings, give them items left behind by others, and provide

safe places for them to hide or store wealth, in the same way

that individual settled halings might. A haling in such a

community may at any point trade her shop for a wagon and

move on with a passing caravan, leaving some other haling

(usually from the same clan) in charge of her business for as

long as the newcomer wishes to stay.

Some haling communities, whether caravans or settle-

ments, also include a few outsiders who have been adopted

by one clan or another. Such individuals are usually found-

lings who were left at a haling camp by parents who did not

want them, or orphans the halings found in their travels.

Halings  raise  such  adoptees  with  all  the  privileges  of

membership in the clan but still expect them to leave upon

reaching maturity. If an adoptee takes poorly to life on the

road, the halings may try to nd her a home in the next

community of her kind that they encounter. Alternatively,

adoptees may nd their way to a permanent haling settle-

ment, where an elderly shopkeeper may be happy to have the

cheap labor that a child represents.

The following sections describe the framework of a half-

ling caravan community, the lifestyle of a lone halfling,

and the structure of a settled community, as well as some

of the details of mundane aspects of daily life in each of

these settings.

Roleplaying  Application:  The  day-to-day  aspects  of

haling society include those elements that are considered

common  knowledge,  the  basic  assumptions  that  halings

make about the world. Consider how these assumptions affect

your characters attitude and how the different customs of

others might spark his innate curiosity.

HALFLING CLANS

Haling clans are groups tied together by family relation-

ships. The precise details of how clan membership is decided

vary from one clan to another, but in most cases a haling is

technically a member of both her mothers and her fathers

clan  at  birth.  Upon  reaching  maturity,  she  must  formally

choose between the two clans and adopt the family name of

the chosen clan. Informally, however, she usually remains

welcome with the clan she did not choose and may travel

with either at will.

Should a haling commit so heinous an act that his clan

wishes to disassociate itself from him, the clan ruler may

choose to eject him. At that point, he may formally join any

other clan that will have him. If no clan ruler is willing to

accept him, he becomes a clanless loner.

Clanless halings do not suffer from the same degree of

stigma as clanless dwarves do, but they can still expect to be

treated with some wariness by others of their kind. Most drift

from one caravan to another, always claiming membership

in a clan not represented there, or make their own way in the

society of some other race.

A  chief  or  elder  heads  each  clan,  chosen  by  acclaim  at

clan gatherings that take place every ve years (or sooner,

in case of an elders untimely death). The clan ruler hands

down clan law, decides major disputes, and generally directs

the activities of the clan. A council of clan leaders from vari-

ous caravans advises him. The composition and size of the

council varies with the movements of the caravans, but the

clan leaders in whatever caravans are camped within twenty

miles of the leaders caravan at any given time are expected

to be at the rulers beck and call.

Periodically, clan rulers gather to map out strategy. They

examine the clans recent travels, discuss which other races

can  be  expected  to  welcome  them  and  which  they  have

offended, what opportunities for work may be opening up

due to wars, natural disasters, and rapid expansion or collapse

of other humanoid settlements. Then they decide upon the

overall movements of the haling race for the immediate

future, making note of potentially hostile areas as well as

those communities expected to welcome their presence.

Within a particular caravan or settlement, the members

of a clan answer to the senior member of that clan. Should

the senior member be too old or inrm to function as clan

leader, the next oldest member assumes the responsibility.

The clan leader must give permission for all marriages and

for transactions involving significant property (such as

wagons). The leader also resolves disputes between clan

members and decides who will take care of the family of a

dead or injured member.

FAMILY UNITS

The nuclear family is the foundation of haling society.

A handfasted or married couple lives together in a single

wagon or home. Once a child is born, one or both parents

raise it to maturity. The community plays a signicant role

in the development of youngsters because everyone knows

what everyone else is doing. Though young halings do

sometimes manage to sneak away from the camp or town

and get into trouble, such incidents are rare. The halings

have long ago learned that failure to keep their mischievous

children corralled does not endear them to the members of

other races among whom they may be living. Upon reach-

ing maturity, a haling may choose to continue living with

his parents or strike out on his own, with the blessing of

the community.

Younger families usually offer widowed or disabled elderly

relatives  a  place  in  their  wagon.  Beyond  that,  however,

extended families usually do not occupy the same wagons

uncles, aunts, and cousins traveling with the same caravan

typically have their own families and their own wagons.

Illness and Aging

When a member of a caravan or settlement falls ill or is

disabled, other members take over her tasks and care for her

until she recovers. No recompense is expected on her part;

instead, she is expected to pitch in and help in turn when

someone else encounters misfortune.

Elderly traveling halings often stay with their caravans

until they can no longer tolerate the rigors of life on the road.

Many never reach this point and simply die en route. Others

gradually realize that they no longer enjoy the traveling life

and leave the caravan to settle down. Those with sufcient

funds sometimes buy property within human, elf, or dwarf

communities and set themselves up as artisans or merchants.

Others settle in a permanent haling settlement and live out

their retirement with others of their kind.

WANDERERS

Most halflings spend the majority of their lives traveling

by either land or sea. They usually travel in large groups,

though it is not uncommon for individual halings to strike

out on their own.

Caravans

Halflings  who  wander  the  wilderness  usually  do  so  in

caravans. A halfling caravan may be of any size; a typical

one  consists  of  twenty-ve  to  thirty-ve  wagons.  Such  a

number ensures that the caravan makes a formidable target

for monsters or brigands but still allows the wagons to spread

out in a campsite without too much crowding.

A caravan may consist of only a single clan, but such a

situation is rare. Usually, three to eight clans are represented

in a single caravan. The clan composition of a given caravan

is  uid  because  families  are  always  free  to  leave  for  other

caravans or strike out on their own.

Though outsiders often consider haling caravans to be

nothing more than a chaotic jumble of wagons, these rolling

communities are in fact structured and stable organizations.

Each member of a caravan has his place and his specic tasks

to perform, and each is both welcome and needed.

Everyone in a haling caravan has a primary task to per-

form. Each person also has the skills to perform one or two

other functions. Thus, if tragedy should befall the caravans

blacksmith, someone else in the group can take over that

function right away.

Young halings receive basic instruction in most of the

tasks associated with daily life. When a youngster displays

talent and interest in one particular kind of task or craft

(usually by the age of 10), she is informally apprenticed to

the master of that trade in the caravan for the next ve years.

When she reaches the age of 16, she is apprenticed to a master

of a different craft. Each year thereafter until she reaches

maturity at 20, she studies a different craft under a different

master. Thus, almost every member of the caravan possesses

at least one rank in several different skills commonly used in

the caravan. When a young haling reaches the age of 20, she

may choose to strike out on her own or to stay and practice

any one of her crafts in the caravan.

Wagons

Halfling  wagons  range  from  family-sized  conveyances

(occupied  by  six  or  more  people  and  pulled  by  oxen  or

a team of horse) to smaller wagons scarcely bigger than

Halfling  wagons  range  from  family-sized  conveyances

(occupied  by  six  or  more  people  and  pulled  by  oxen  or

a team of horse) to smaller wagons scarcely bigger than

a cart (home to a single hal ing and typically pulled by a

donkey, pony, or occasionally a team of goats). All wagons

are covered and built of sturdy hardwood to resist rot and

missile  weapons.  Hal ings  often  treat  their  wagons  with

water- and  ame-retardant materials.

Each wagon contains a familys  personal possessions,

clothing, food stores, and the equipment for whatever crafts

or professions family members pursue. All wagon doors can

be locked but rarely are while in camp.

While on the move, caravans usually travel by day and camp

in the open at night. Each family is responsible for its own food,

so family members forage for fruit and vegetables and raise their

own meat animalsusually goats, chickens, turkeys, cows,

pigs, or rabbits. The larger animals trot alongside the wagon,

while the smaller ones usually ride in coops or hutches; all are

turned loose to forage when the caravan settles into a camp.

One member of the family usually cooks the meals, though

in some families that responsibility rotates.

Leaders

The following of cials are present in most caravans. Other

functions may also exist depending upon the kinds of work

the caravan members usually undertake and the races with

which they usually associate.

Head Teamster: This of cial sets the order of wagons

when the caravan moves, decides when to start and stop, and

determines the direction of movement. When informed of

potential hazards by the scout, he can decide whether to face

them or avoid them. The head teamster also calls for more

wagons to be built should they be required.

Scout: The scout is an outrider who travels ahead of the

main caravan to spot potential hazards, such as box canyons or

orc strongholds. The scout reports back to the head teamster

every two hours. In particularly dangerous or rugged areas, a

caravan may employ a chief scout and several subordinates.

Trailer:  Charged  with  riding  behind  the  caravan,  the

trailer picks up stragglers and herd animals that have wan-

dered off. Her primary task is to ensure that no one gets lost

and falls behind, and she also serves as rear scout for the

caravan. Should a signi cant problem develop at the rear,

she can call for an emergency stop. As with scouts, caravan

sometimes use several trailers.

Chief Herder: This of cial is in charge of all the animals

that travel with the caravan. The chief herder ensures that

the animals have enough time to forage and that suf cient

food and water are available. While the caravan moves, he

travels up and down the line of wagons, checking the animals

for signs of exhaustion or illness. He tends to any serious

injuries on the spot and addresses any minor ones when the

caravan stops for the night. While in camp, he ensures that

the animals are fed. When entering areas where food is scarce,

he ensures that the caravan carries suf cient food and water

to sustain the animals as well as the people.

Old One: Usually an elderly hal ing, the old one decides

interclan disputes and advises the head teamster and clan lead-

ers on direction of movement and strategy for negotiations.

An old one occasionally has levels in diviner or some other

means of magical knowledge.

Blacksmith: Respected for her importance to the com-

munity, the blacksmith equals the chief herder in rank. The

two confer on issues such as what kinds of loads and terrain

the caravans vehicles and mounts can take and what repairs

are needed at any given stop.

Wheelwright/Wainwright: These two functions

repairing  wheels  and  wagons  and  building  new  ones  as

neededmay be handled by a single individual in small

caravans or two different hal ings in larger ones.

Cook: Most families make their own meals, but the cook

ensures that those hal ings who are busy with other tasks all

the time (such as the scout, the blacksmith, and the trailer) get

adequate meals. The cook is the keeper of the supply wagon

that carries extra food stores for the caravan as well as a wide

array of cooking implements.

Herald: This  of cial serves as the mouthpiece for the

caravan. She deals with outsiders, asking permission to camp,

determining what services are needed in a given area, and

providing information on the kinds of work that the people

in the caravan can do.

Cleric or Deacon: Caravans often have a cleric, though some

have several and others none at all. The cleric is responsible

for of ciating at marriages and funerals and generally looking

out for the spiritual well-being of the community.

Most hal ings, however, worship the deities of their choice

without the aid of a cleric. In such cases, a layperson known

as the deacon administers the rituals when needed, ensures

that homage is paid to the deities when appropriate, and keeps

track of ceremonial items for the community.

Disputes and Laws

Disputes among hal ings happen frequently, but they are

rarely important enough to cause a serious rift. Quarrels over

practical jokes, who buys ale, or other such small matters

are much more common than deadly  ghts over potential

mates, property, or beliefs. Hal ings view property of any

kind, including their own coins, as transient. Its nice when

one has plenty of money, but theres always more to be found

where that came from.

Laws exist within hal ing clans to cover the worst of

crimes, but hal ings see no point in trying to make rules for

every argument. They are always free to separate from their

communities to go adventuring or to join others of their

clan in other caravans at any time. Thus, should enmity exist

between two hal ings for a long period, they usually simply

go their own ways.

Disputes that cannot be resolved peacefully between the

parties are adjudicated by the clan leader or by the caravans

or settlements old one, depending upon whether the parties

are from the same or different clans.

LONERS

The famous hal ing wanderlust ensures that most hal ings

spend at least a few years of their lives wandering alone,

away from their clans and caravans. Such loner halings

are often adventurers, and most fall in with other adventur-

ers of different races. These associations can last for many

years, and a loner haling often forms fast friendships with

all his companions.

Other loner halings choose to make their own way in the

cities or towns of other races. Many gravitate to human cities,

where they function as thieves, burglars, or entertainers. Some

set up their own shops, offering goods to the publicand

clandestine aid to other halings. A few loner halings wander

the wilderness on their own, living off the land and making

friends with the outcasts and loners of other races.

Elderly halings who have tired of the traveling life may

also become loners, purchasing homes or land and settling

down to retire. Such landed halings frequently allow other

halings to stash goods and money on their property and

hide out there when the heat is on.

SETTLED HALFLINGS

Although halings prefer to wander, some permanent settle-

ments do exist. These are often founded on land belonging

to a member of some other race who owes the founders a

great favor. Typically in such a case, the owner grants the

haling race permission to use the land in perpetuity, and

its ownership passes to the leaders of the haling town free

of charge should any new owner ever wish to sell the original

owners lands.

Such  haling  settlements  are  rarely  bigger  than  small

towns, because few halings truly wish to settle down. Their

organization typically mirrors that of the closest settlement

of some other race; they expect to have the most contact with

people from that community and want them to feel comfort-

able. Each town does, however, have clan leaders, an old one,

a  blacksmith,  a  chief  herder,  and  at  least  one  priest,  all  of

whom function as they would in a caravan (see above).

Halings who live in a settled community usually grow

crops in addition to raising herd animals. Orchards and

cultivated elds dot the surrounding area, and most settled

communities are renowned for their simple pastoral beauty.

Houses are usually built of the most common material in the

area,  wooden  structures  and  earthen  dwellings  being  the

most prevalent.

The residents of a settled community apprentice their

young in the same manner that caravan halings do, but

the choices of profession are often more numerous in a com-

munity. Every kind of artisan and merchant is represented in

a haling settlement, though they need not all be halings.

Butchers, bakers, jewelers, metalworkers, candlemakers,

wainwrights, animal breeders and trainers, tinkers, potters,

cobblers, weavers, seamstresses, and purveyors of magic items

all have shops, and at least two taverns operate in any such

town. Just about any service available in a human community

is available in a haling settlement.

The typical haling settlement includes a school where

young halings can gain some book learning and a school

of magic where those who desire to do so can train in the

arcane arts. A temple to each of the major haling deities is

on hand as well.

Each community also has a banker and a fence. The latter

buys stolen goods from itinerant halings and resells them

in safe locations. The banker caches money from wandering

halings and keeps it safe until they return, charging a small

fee for the service.

HALFLINGS AND

OTHER RACES

Halings are generally amiable creatures, and they form

fast friendships with people who have earned their respect.

Obviously  foolish  individuals  of  any  race  earn  only  their

scorn, but those who prove their worth by aiding a haling

or by seeing through one of her schemes is a candidate for

long-term friendship. Many a prospective marks ire has been

turned aside when the haling who was trying to cheat him

burst out into laughter and bought him a drink.

For the most part, halflings are quite tolerant of other

races. They value their own ways and assume that others

value theirs just as much. Do what you like as long as you

dont get caught, goes an old halfling saying, and most

halings are quite happy to extend that same concept to

other races as well.

Dwarves: Halings admire dwarves for their industrious-

ness and their strong family ties, both qualities that resonate

through the haling culture as well. Dwarves also have a

nose for money, so allying with them on small-scale treasure

hunts can be quite protable.

Like anyone else who lives in the same place all his life, the

typical dwarf is rather stodgy and more than a little provin-

cial. Dwarves are also a bit too warlike for the halings taste.

Why cant they just learn to get along with everyone else, like

the halings do? Theyre not even content with making their

own warstheyre always trying to teach halings how to

ght too. Its best just to ignore them when they act arrogant

and overbearing. They cant help it, after all; its just the way

they are.

Elves: Halings are somewhat in awe of elves and their

high civilization. Elves live so long and see so much that

halings tend to feel a bit inferior around them, like awk-

ward younger siblings. Thus, they try to be on their very

best behavior around elves, and they tend to suppress their

rambunctious nature and their open, friendly charm. Only

when they have lived near elves for periods extending into

years do they fully come out of their shells.

In spite of their discomfort around elves, halings appreci-

ate the fact that elves get along with most other races, and

they are also impressed by the fact that elves try their best

to avoid warfare through negotiation. Halfling caravans

frequently make camp near elf lands; the elves are almost

always kind and welcoming, as though they were actually

glad to see their smaller friends. When elves purchase their

goods or ask for help with particular ventures, halings are

generally attered and only too glad to be of assistance.

Gnomes: Gnomes are kindred spirits and fellow little

people. As such, theyre made-to-order allies for halings.

And if those considerations werent enough to make visiting

them fun, theyre also good wizards and fabulous singers.

Having a gnome bard join in the evening song around the

campre is a real treat.

However, gnomes are strangely short-tempered creatures.

They can be chatting pleasantly one minute and shouting the

next. They also seem easily frustrated, getting worked up over

the smallest things. Perhaps theyve developed bedsores or

something from sitting in one place all the time.

Half-Elves: Half-elves are just like elves but less so. They

have the same grace and charm in a halings eyes, but their

demeanor isnt as intimidating as that of a full elfs. Half-elves

live much shorter lives, so theyre not always talking about

things that happened hundreds of years ago. This tendency

to live in the here and now tends to endear them to their

haling companions.

Half-elves have all the charm of their elf parents, coupled

with a respect for the ways of others that can come only

from being part of more than one culture. Theyre as good

at negotiating for what they need as halings are, though

many of them have a troubling honest streak. Theyre also

individualists,  each  different  from  the  others,  and  each

interesting in her own way. All these factors make them real

kindred spirits, though theyre a little too tall.

Half-Orcs: In general, halings consider half-orcs strong

like bullsand dumb like bulls. They tend to make good

marks for condence games and even theft, but woe to the

haling who is caught. Half-orcs are the least susceptible to

haling charm and wit of all the other races.

On the other hand, its nice to be on the good side of a half-

orc when a strong sword-arm is needed. Maybe half-orcs dont

always get the more subtle jokes, but they can appreciate the

more obvious kinds of humor that few others do. Of course,

any haling who can get a half-orc to laugh almost always

gets a free drink for the effort.

Humans: Halings enjoy the company of humans more

than  that  of  any  other  race.  Endlessly  adaptable  and  ever-

changing, they are very much like halings in spirit. Halings

have worked hard to cultivate their relationship with humans

and ensure that they are always welcome in human settle-

ments. To gain the enmity of the human race would deprive

the halings of a signicant area in which to roam, because

humans hold more lands than any other race.

Halings consider humans big and goofy, but rather sweet

in their own way. Theyre smart and adaptable, they like to

travel, and they can work hard when they want to. Theyre

almost as friendly as half-elves and a little bit gullible like

half-orcsa winning combination in any halings book.

Human settlements are good places for halings to nd

work, because humans always need something done. Often

this need stems from their odd tendency to declare war on

one another, but thats their own business. Even without

a war, theyre always creatingbuilding, expanding, and

inventing. Their societies are varied and always changing,

and halings who go to the same settlement a second time

may nd its needs and outlook very different.

Raptorans: To a haling, a raptoran seems like a combination

of an eagle and an elf. The raptorans cleverness and their ability

to y fascinate the halings, who cant get enough of raptorans

stories about how it feels to have the wind in their faces.

On the other hand, raptorans arent very good customers,

since they hardly ever want to buy anything, and they usually

dont need to hire out any work. They also prefer that halings

camp far away from their homes and not remain long if they

do pass through the area.

Overall, halings nd raptorans a bit standofsh, and see

their need to give permission for camping on open land as

ludicrous. This practice, combined with the raptorans ten-

dency to consider proposals for a long time, leads halings to

conclude (incorrectly) that they can do anything they wish on

raptoran land as long as they ask rst. Such misapprehensions

have led to more than one clash between the two races.

Roleplaying Application: The above generalizations

represent how an average haling is likely to view someone

from a given race. Since there are no average members of

society, its up to you to decide how well these comments

t your impressions of the individual. Does your character

adhere to the stereotypes presented above? If not, why not?

Was there something in your characters past that changed

his or her view of a given race from the status quo?

RELIGION

Most halflings maintain a deep reverence for their own

gods, and many temporarily adopt the worship of the deities

of other nearby races as a matter of politeness. Wandering

halings also venerate a host of local nature spirits and lesser

deities that rule over particular forests, lakes, and marshes.

They typically stop at the small shrines of such deities to pay

homage, pray for a safe journey, and leave a bit of food for the

local animals in the gods names.

The  haling  pantheon  is  led  by  Yondalla,  who  is  also

represented  in  a  different  aspect  by  the  deity  known  as

Dallah Thaun (see below). Other members of the pantheon

include Arvoreen, Brandobaris, Cyrollalee, Sheela Peryroyl,

and Urogalan, all of whom are described in detail in the

FORGOTTEN REALMS supplement Faiths and Pantheons. Brief

game  information  about  each  of  these  additional  deities

appears at the end of this section.

Organized religious services occur rarely, usually only to

celebrate holidays and to solemnize certain rites of passage,

such as births, weddings, and funerals. Most halings never

set foot inside a temple except when theyre in a haling

settlement, but they visit the wagon of the caravans cleric or

deacon whenever they feel the need for spiritual guidance.

Offerings to the church are usually in the form of goods or

food, though halings are happy to contribute coin for special

needs, such as repairing a temple or building a new one.

A haling wedding requires a cleric of Yondalla to sanc-

tify the vows of the couple. At a funeral, a cleric or deacon

YONDALLA

Greater Goddess (Lawful Good)

Yondalla is the mother of all halflings and the

creator  of  their  race.  Her  titles  include  the

Protector and Provider, the Nurturing

Matriarch,  and  the  Blessed  One.  She

protects  the  race  and  epitomizes  home,

harmony, plenty, and happiness. She has

a darker aspect known as Dallah Thaun

(see  below),  who  is  known  only  among

hal ings. Yondalla is described on page 108

of the Players Handbook.

The  Blessed  One  appears  as  a  beautiful,

proud, blond-haired hal ing, garbed in green and

brown and carrying a short sword and shield.

Portfolio: Hal ings, explorers.

Domains: Good, Law, Protection.

Cleric Training: A cleric of Yondalla trains new

followers  by  borrowing  a  wagon  from  a  hal ing

caravan,  then  taking  the  would-be  clerics  away

from their families for a month or two. The cleric

and his disciples wander the back roads of the land, seeking

sights that none of the pilgrimsteacher and students

alikehave ever seen before.

of Yondalla

Quests: The safety of the hal ing people is Yondal-

las  rst concern, but she is also eager

to  chart  new  territory  for  hal ing

caravans  to  visit.  Her  followers  act

as guards and guides for caravans and

trading companies, capture the raiders that

plague the highways, and lead expeditions

to unexplored lands.

Prayers: Yondallas prayers are models

of understatement. A prayer for healing

might begin I am in such  ne health,

yet . . . and a prayer for intercession

might begin A minor annoyance

has been visited upon me . . .

Temples: Yondallas temples

are  gathering  places  for  the

otherwise seminomadic hal ing

population. They are storehouses

of food, weapons, and everything

else needed to equip a caravan for a

long journey. The clerics at a temple

can always be counted upon to help

a hal ing in needand her non-

hal ing friends as well, provided

that they seem trustworthy.

Rites:  Yondallas  rites  center

When a hal ing caravan pulls into a town near harvest time,

Yondallas worshipers generally hold a festival called the

Pageant of the First Fruit.

Herald  and  Allies:  Yondalla  uses  a  trumpet

archon with 18 Hit Dice that resembles a hal ing as

her herald. Her allies are hound archons, astral

devas, and planetars.

Favored Weapon: Short sword.

DALLAH THAUN

Intermediate  Goddess  (Chaotic

Neutral)

Dallah Thaun, the Lady of Mystery, is

the  dark  aspect  of  Yondalla.  Physically  split

off from Yondalla when she created the hal ing

race, Dallah Thaun is worshiped both as a deity in

her  own  right  and  also  as  part  of  Yondalla.  Anyone

who worships one goddess worships both, and prayers

to one are heard by both. Each goddess knows everything

the  other  knows  and  is  privy  to  the  others  plans.  Since

they both work toward the same goalthe bene t

of the hal ing racethey do not quibble over one

anothers methods. Instead, the two goddesses utilize

each  others  strengths  and  compensate  for  each

others weaknesses.

For  example,  when  someone  evil  harms  a  great

number of hal ings, Yondallas followers nurture the

survivors  while  Dallah  Thauns  seek  vengeance.

Likewise, the Blessed One provides her

people with food, comfort, and healing,

while the Lady of Mystery helps them

 nd wealth. Should any dirty work need

to be done, it falls under Dallah Thauns

purview, and Dallah Thaun is said to receive

the  souls  of  dead  hal ings  and  guide

them to their  nal reward.

There  is  no  inherent  evil  in  accu-

mulating wealth; indeed, a nest egg for

ones golden years, when a hard-working

hal ing can no longer work as hard, is a

necessity. How one gains this wealth is

another matter. The Lady of Mystery

does not condone killing or even harm-

ing others for money, but relieving the

overly wealthy of a portion of their burden

is quite acceptable. In fact, any method that

harms no one is  ne with Dallah Thaun, so

long as the perpetrator doesnt get caught.

Secrets, guile, lies, half-truths,

 attery,  intrigue,  manipulation,

and all things done by stealth are

the  purview  of  Dallah  Thaun.

Dont get caught is her credo,

and the lesson that she passes along to

all her worshipers. Dallah Thaun also serves as an avenger

for any wrongs done to her people.

Dallah Thaun

and Yondalla

on family and community. Weddings

feature particularly elaborate and joyous ceremonies, because

tying two souls together for life is so rare in the hal ing race.

52

Very  few  outsiders  know  of  Dallah

Thauns existence, and the hal ings like to

keep it that way. Since she is an aspect of

Yondalla, hal ings who venerate her can

truly say that they worship Yondalla

who, as everyone knows, is a lawful good

goddess.  Since  no  one  except  hal ings

realizes that Dallah Thaun exists, she is

not as powerful as her other half. In many

ways,  the  two  goddesses  epitomize  the

dichotomy between openness and secrecy

that is so characteristic of hal ings.

The Lady of Mystery appears as a beautiful

female hal ing with dark hair and eyes. She

dresses  all  in  black  and  wears  a  voluminous

black cloak with a hood that conceals her face.

She tosses a gold coin in her gloved hands.

Portfolio: Hal ings, secrets, guile, thieves and

rogues, acquisition of wealth, death.

Domains: Chaos, Knowledge, Luck, Trickery.

Cleric Training: Clerics of Dallah Thaun are

sort, newly acquired wealth, thieves tools, and

other tools of the trade.

Herald and Allies: Dallah Thauns herald

on the Material Plane is a hal ing 20th-level

rogue. Her allies are janni, gray slaadi, and

death slaadi.

Favored Weapon: Dagger.

chosen by senior clerics of both Yondalla and Dallah Thaun.

They covertly watch the young people in a community and

identify those who have the mind-set and talents for Dallah

Thauns service. They begin to groom those individuals as

clerics without even telling them they are being trained. The

candidates are sent on covert missions, told secrets and bade

to keep them, and provided with opportunities to participate

in con dence games. When the secret of their training comes

out, they may either accept Dallah Thauns service or refuse

it with no stigma.

Quests: The Lady of Mysterys followers often undertake

quests  that  involve  stealing  from  the  rich,  discovering

secrets,  and  acquiring  particular  items  through  means

other than force. If halflings are in trouble with a local

lord over thefts that have occurred while they were camped

on  his  land,  Dallah  Thauns  followers  are  the  ones  who

enter the lords keep by night and suggest that harming or

expelling the hal ings could result in the revelation of the

lords affair with a certain young noblewoman destined to

marry another.

Prayers: Prayers to Dallah Thaun are usually whispered or

mumbled, and they often sound like the kind of wishes one

makes while daydreaming. Typical prayers begin If only I

could get a hundred gold pieces, or If only I could get out

of this place safely, or If only I could  gure out how this

trap works.

Shrines: Dallah Thauns shrines are usually surreptitiously

folded into Yondallas. For example, a temple to Yondalla in a

hal ing town might have a shrine to Dallah Thaun behind

a secret door or a sliding panel. Similarly, a family shrine to

Yondalla in a wagon might have a rotating panel with Dallah

Thauns holy symbol on the other side.

Rites: Dallah Thauns clerics celebrate the same holy days

as Yondallas do, and they are usually present for the same

celebrations. They also bless new ventures, successes of any

HALFLING HISTORY

AND FOLKLORE

Many  outsiders  believe  that  halflings  are  the  youngest

mortal race in the world, and the halflings do not dispute

that claim. They have no interest in participating in the

who is older controversies in which elves and dwarves

often engage; to them, it is better to be young and have a

Hal ing civilization is more complex than it  rst appears

to tell how long a given tradition has been in force. If the

No one knows exactly when the  rst hal ings appeared,

but legend holds that they were the last race createdeven

after  humans.  Whether  or  not  their  creation  story  and

other legends handed down from parent to child are true,

they explain much about why hal ings feel the need to be

constantly on the move, and how a touch of larceny came to

be deeply rooted in the hal ing soul.

Roleplaying Application: Halflings are inordinately

fond of stories, and most know enough to entertain their

fellows for years on end. What is your characters favorite

legend? Is there a legendary character that inspires him?

Does he plan to create new legends of his own, based on

his personal exploits?

MYTHIC ORIGINS

In the days when the world was still young, after the First

War that spilled the blood of so many divine beings, the gods

began to create mortal races in their own images. First came

the elves, who laid claim to the forests and seas, and then the

dwarves, who took the hills, mountains, and underground.

(Perhaps it was the other way around; the elves and dwarves

have never agreed about who was  rst.) Next came the bestial

orcs, and then the humans. Still, Yondalla had created no

people of her own. Instead, she traveled the world over and

watched the creatures the other gods had created, determined

that hers would be the best.

She saw the fey folksatyrs, sprites, dryads, and other

dwellers  in  the  woodlands.  These  creatures  displayed  a

zest for life and a curiosity about new things that charmed

the goddess entirely. Many of them also had the bene t of

a compact size that made them seem innocuous to larger

creatures and helped them to avoid danger. However, they

were frivolous creatures who feared larger beings. Therefore,

with some regret, Yondalla left them and traveled on.

Next she visited the elves, who were frail and beautiful,

but oh so haughty. They had a freedom of spirit that Yondalla

much admired, and a grace and agility that put other creatures

to shame. To top it all off, their beauty was near to that of

Corellon Larethian himself. Still, they took too long to do

anything; Yondalla itched for action, and there was little to

be had in their towns. So on she traveled.

Next  she  visited  the  dwarves  in  their  cities  below  the

mountains. Such pride in family and home she had never

seen before, and it pleased her; for what would a mortal be

without a family? Who would remember him when he was

gone? Still, the dwarves were sour folk, given to drudgery.

Who could really be happy toiling away in the bowels of the

earth, con ned by rock and stone, never knowing the joy of

the open air and the beautiful land? So she took up her shield

and continued on her way.

Next she found the orcs, and oh how dreadful they seemed.

So brutal and  erce they were,  lling their short lives with

rage and combat. Still, she was fascinated by their boldness.

These creatures showed almost no fear of their enemies, of

death, or of any hardship. However, no good could come of

such brutality, and Yondalla did not tarry in their realms.

Next she came to the humans, and here she found much

to admire. These creatures were strong and clever, brave and

quick, and  exible enough to adapt to any circumstance.

Indeed, they were so  exible that no two of their settle-

ments were alike. Such diversity was surely a  ne thing,

but they seemed oddly given to warring with each other

over the very differences that made them able to survive in

different places. They spread so fastwhy, they had nearly

taken over the plains she had chosen for her people, not to

mention shares of the forests, seas, and mountains that the

other gods claimed.

After  her  journey,  Yondalla  returned  to  her  home  and

thought about what she had seen. Each of the mortal races

had a quality she wanted for her race, but each also had many

faults.  With  this  realization  came  a  decision:  She  would

take a bit of each races essence and mold them into a new

beingone that had all the qualities she admired in each of

the other races.

The following night, she crept through the forest and seized

a pixie to use as the vessel for her new creation. Silencing the

creature with magic, she crept on to the settlement of the elves,

where she drained a bit of their agility and infused the pixie

with it. The creature grew several inches, and Yondalla had to

bind it to keep it from dancing away. Moving belowground to

the city of the dwarves, Yondalla drained off a small amount of

their devotion to family and clan and infused the pixie with

that. The pixie grew still more, and its wings shriveled as its

features became less delicate. Its frantic movements slowed,

and it clung to her as though to a mother. Then she moved on

to the orc encampment, where she drew off some of the orcs

boldness and infused the pixie with that. The pixie grew yet

again and began to look about for some trouble to get into.

Before it could  nd any, the goddess hurried off to the nearest

human city and drained the essence of these highly adaptable

beings. A dose of this draught caused the pixie to grow a bit

more and release its hold on Yondalla.

The  goddess  surveyed  her  handiwork  and  was  pleased.

The creature that stood before her was about 3 feet tall and

perfectly proportioned. His wide, blue eyes shone with curi-

osity and an utter lack of fear. His slim, agile form radiated

vitality and grace. When he picked up some wood and sharp

rocks and began to fashion a wheel, Yondalla knew that she

had created the perfect mortal creature.

The other gods, however, were not so pleased when they

discovered that Yondalla had tapped their creations and

drained portions of their essence. The elves were now not as

agile as they had been, the orcs showed a bit of fear at times,

and the dwarves sometimes left their clan homes. As for the

humans, they slowed their technological advances and their

spread into different lands.

Yondalla   attered  the  other  gods  and  praised  their  cre-

ations. Why should I try to duplicate perfection itself? she

cried. I only took a bit of each, after all. There was more than

enough of each virtue for the other races and mine as well.

Slightly molli ed, the other gods nevertheless decreed that

Yondalla must be punished for her crime. They ruled that

her people, whom she named the hal ings, could have no

lands of their own. Always would they wander, and their

welcome in the lands of others would be on their own

merit alone. Yondalla agreed.

Furthermore,  they  decreed  that  Yondalla  must

expunge the larcenous streak in her own being that

had caused her to steal the essences of the other gods

creations. So Yondalla clove off the portion of herself

that espoused thievery, secrets, vengeance, and other

dark thoughts, leaving only the purest goodness and

virtue. The dark portion of Yondalla took on a form

that resembled her own and faded into the back-

ground, where it would remain ever after as a separate

goddess called Dallah Thaunbound to Yondalla but

separate. Yondalla stepped forward, and the gods found

no fault with her new character.

Ever since, hal ings have wandered the earth but

called no place home. They have worshiped a dual

goddess while claiming to revere only one.

LEGENDS

Hal ing culture is replete with stories. Every hal ing

wants  to  make  his  mark  and  become  the  stuff  of

legends, and many succeed. Every family has stories

about the exploits of various uncles, aunts, cousins,

grandparents, and other relatives. Every clan has tales

about its famous members. In addition, the race as a

whole  has  legends  about  the  hal ing  gods  and  the

best-known heroes of the race.

Hal ings tell their tales under the stars when they

camp at night, in the wagons to pass the time while

the landscape rolls by, and in the taverns and inns

of other lands. All hal ing legends are entertaining,

and most praise the wit, warmth, and deftness of the

hal ing race.

The following are some of the most popular hal ing

legends ever told. All are considered trueor at least

more true than those of any other race.

Silinda and the King of Arendal

Long ago, in a caravan that roamed the whole of the

continent, lived a young halfling named Silinda.

Fair of face and lithe of form, Silinda set off to  nd

adventure on her twentieth birthday, after turning

down several offers of handfasting.

She left with only a change of clothing, a blanket,

her  trusty  sword,  the  thieves  tools  that  her  aunt

had fashioned for her, some salve for wounds, and

enough food for one day. She had no fear of starving

or misfortune, only a wide-eyed wonder at the world

that stretched before her.

After walking for a few hours, Silinda heard a plaintive

cry. Help me! called a voice from the woods she was

passing. Silinda moved as quickly as she could through

constantly on the move, and how a touch of larceny came to

be deeply rooted in the hal ing soul.

Roleplaying Application: Halflings are inordinately

fond of stories, and most know enough to entertain their

fellows for years on end. What is your characters favorite

legend? Is there a legendary character that inspires him?

Does he plan to create new legends of his own, based on

his personal exploits?

MYTHIC ORIGINS

In the days when the world was still young, after the First

War that spilled the blood of so many divine beings, the gods

began to create mortal races in their own images. First came

the elves, who laid claim to the forests and seas, and then the

dwarves, who took the hills, mountains, and underground.

(Perhaps it was the other way around; the elves and dwarves

have never agreed about who was  rst.) Next came the bestial

orcs, and then the humans. Still, Yondalla had created no

people of her own. Instead, she traveled the world over and

watched the creatures the other gods had created, determined

that hers would be the best.

She saw the fey folksatyrs, sprites, dryads, and other

dwellers  in  the  woodlands.  These  creatures  displayed  a

zest for life and a curiosity about new things that charmed

the goddess entirely. Many of them also had the bene t of

a compact size that made them seem innocuous to larger

creatures and helped them to avoid danger. However, they

were frivolous creatures who feared larger beings. Therefore,

with some regret, Yondalla left them and traveled on.

Next she visited the elves, who were frail and beautiful,

but oh so haughty. They had a freedom of spirit that Yondalla

much admired, and a grace and agility that put other creatures

to shame. To top it all off, their beauty was near to that of

Corellon Larethian himself. Still, they took too long to do

anything; Yondalla itched for action, and there was little to

be had in their towns. So on she traveled.

Next  she  visited  the  dwarves  in  their  cities  below  the

mountains. Such pride in family and home she had never

seen before, and it pleased her; for what would a mortal be

without a family? Who would remember him when he was

gone? Still, the dwarves were sour folk, given to drudgery.

Who could really be happy toiling away in the bowels of the

earth, con ned by rock and stone, never knowing the joy of

the open air and the beautiful land? So she took up her shield

and continued on her way.

Next she found the orcs, and oh how dreadful they seemed.

So brutal and  erce they were,  lling their short lives with

rage and combat. Still, she was fascinated by their boldness.

These creatures showed almost no fear of their enemies, of

death, or of any hardship. However, no good could come of

such brutality, and Yondalla did not tarry in their realms.

Next she came to the humans, and here she found much

to admire. These creatures were strong and clever, brave and

quick, and  exible enough to adapt to any circumstance.

Indeed, they were so  exible that no two of their settle-

ments were alike. Such diversity was surely a  ne thing,

but they seemed oddly given to warring with each other

over the very differences that made them able to survive in

different places. They spread so fastwhy, they had nearly

taken over the plains she had chosen for her people, not to

mention shares of the forests, seas, and mountains that the

other gods claimed.

After  her  journey,  Yondalla  returned  to  her  home  and

thought about what she had seen. Each of the mortal races

had a quality she wanted for her race, but each also had many

faults.  With  this  realization  came  a  decision:  She  would

take a bit of each races essence and mold them into a new

beingone that had all the qualities she admired in each of

the other races.

The following night, she crept through the forest and seized

a pixie to use as the vessel for her new creation. Silencing the

creature with magic, she crept on to the settlement of the elves,

where she drained a bit of their agility and infused the pixie

with it. The creature grew several inches, and Yondalla had to

bind it to keep it from dancing away. Moving belowground to

the city of the dwarves, Yondalla drained off a small amount of

their devotion to family and clan and infused the pixie with

that. The pixie grew still more, and its wings shriveled as its

features became less delicate. Its frantic movements slowed,

and it clung to her as though to a mother. Then she moved on

to the orc encampment, where she drew off some of the orcs

boldness and infused the pixie with that. The pixie grew yet

again and began to look about for some trouble to get into.

Before it could  nd any, the goddess hurried off to the nearest

human city and drained the essence of these highly adaptable

beings. A dose of this draught caused the pixie to grow a bit

more and release its hold on Yondalla.

The  goddess  surveyed  her  handiwork  and  was  pleased.

The creature that stood before her was about 3 feet tall and

perfectly proportioned. His wide, blue eyes shone with curi-

osity and an utter lack of fear. His slim, agile form radiated

vitality and grace. When he picked up some wood and sharp

rocks and began to fashion a wheel, Yondalla knew that she

had created the perfect mortal creature.

The other gods, however, were not so pleased when they

discovered that Yondalla had tapped their creations and

drained portions of their essence. The elves were now not as

agile as they had been, the orcs showed a bit of fear at times,

and the dwarves sometimes left their clan homes. As for the

humans, they slowed their technological advances and their

spread into different lands.

Yondalla   attered  the  other  gods  and  praised  their  cre-

ations. Why should I try to duplicate perfection itself? she

cried. I only took a bit of each, after all. There was more than

enough of each virtue for the other races and mine as well.

Slightly molli ed, the other gods nevertheless decreed that

Yondalla must be punished for her crime. They ruled that

her people, whom she named the hal ings, could have no

lands of their own. Always would they wander, and their

welcome in the lands of others would be on their own

merit alone. Yondalla agreed.

Furthermore,  they  decreed  that  Yondalla  must

expunge the larcenous streak in her own being that

had caused her to steal the essences of the other gods

creations. So Yondalla clove off the portion of herself

that espoused thievery, secrets, vengeance, and other

dark thoughts, leaving only the purest goodness and

virtue. The dark portion of Yondalla took on a form

that resembled her own and faded into the back-

ground, where it would remain ever after as a separate

goddess called Dallah Thaunbound to Yondalla but

separate. Yondalla stepped forward, and the gods found

no fault with her new character.

Ever since, hal ings have wandered the earth but

called no place home. They have worshiped a dual

goddess while claiming to revere only one.

LEGENDS

Hal ing culture is replete with stories. Every hal ing

wants  to  make  his  mark  and  become  the  stuff  of

legends, and many succeed. Every family has stories

about the exploits of various uncles, aunts, cousins,

grandparents, and other relatives. Every clan has tales

about its famous members. In addition, the race as a

whole  has  legends  about  the  hal ing  gods  and  the

best-known heroes of the race.

Hal ings tell their tales under the stars when they

camp at night, in the wagons to pass the time while

the landscape rolls by, and in the taverns and inns

of other lands. All hal ing legends are entertaining,

and most praise the wit, warmth, and deftness of the

hal ing race.

The following are some of the most popular hal ing

legends ever told. All are considered trueor at least

more true than those of any other race.

Silinda and the King of Arendal

Long ago, in a caravan that roamed the whole of the

continent, lived a young halfling named Silinda.

Fair of face and lithe of form, Silinda set off to  nd

adventure on her twentieth birthday, after turning

down several offers of handfasting.

She left with only a change of clothing, a blanket,

her  trusty  sword,  the  thieves  tools  that  her  aunt

had fashioned for her, some salve for wounds, and

enough food for one day. She had no fear of starving

or misfortune, only a wide-eyed wonder at the world

that stretched before her.

After walking for a few hours, Silinda heard a plaintive

cry. Help me! called a voice from the woods she was

passing. Silinda moved as quickly as she could through

the underbrush toward the sound, but could nd nothing.

At last, looking up, she spied a human dressed in hunters

garb, hanging in a net suspended by a rope from the highest

branch of the tree. Please get me down, he said, desperation

in his tone. I dropped my sword when the trap sprung, and

I have no way to get free.

Of course, said Silinda. After quickly spreading her

blanket beneath the tree to cushion his fall, she shinnied up

the trunk and out onto the branch. Drawing her trusty sword,

she cut through the stout rope that bound him. Thank you,

little maid, said the man, divesting himself of the net. I was

scouting for the princes party when I ran afoul of this orc

trap. They would have come and killed me by nightfall.

Thats all right, Silinda said. She introduced herself,

adding, I was glad to help.

I have no money, Silinda, said the man, retrieving his

sword from the brush nearby, but I will do you a good

turn someday.

Silinda  thanked  the  man  and  walked  on.  Presently  she

began to feel hungry, so she found a pleasant grove of trees

and sat down to eat her lunch. She unpacked the bread and

cheese that her mother had packed for her and tore off a piece

of each. Before she could raise a morsel to her lips, she heard

a small, reedy voice from somewhere near her feet. Help us!

it cried.

Silinda combed through the grass and saw a depression in

which stood several pixies bound to stakes. Water from the

recent rain had lled the tiny pit to just under their chins.

How did you come to be there? asked Silinda, casting an

eye skyward as dark clouds began to roll in.

We made fun of the wrong big one, said one pixie miser-

ably. We didnt know it could see us until it was too late. It

grabbed us and tied us to these posts. Evil it wasyou could

see in its glowing green eyes.

Well, obviously it had no sense of humor, said Silinda,

carefully grasping the top of the leaders pole and working it

loose. In a few moments she had rescued all the pixies, who

were not only soaking wet but also pitifully thin. How long

have you been in there? she asked.

Days, replied the leader. We didnt know whether we

would starve or drown rst.

Well, have  some of my lunch,  Silinda  said,  giving  the

pixies her bread and cheese.

The pixies sighed their gratitude and fell upon the food,

eating until none was left. Oh, we have eaten all your food,

cried the leader.

No matter, Silinda said. I can always nd more.

We have nothing but our gratitude to give you, said the

leader. But we will do you a good turn someday.

Silinda bade the pixies farewell and set off again through

the woods. Presently, she came upon an injured man lying

on the path in a pool of his own blood. The corpses of several

other men lay nearby. Please, help me! he said.

Of course, said Silinda, withdrawing the wound salve

from her pack and sitting down to minister to his injuries.

How did this happen?

I was part of the princes escort, he said faintly. We met

a man on the road and told him to make way. Suddenly, he

transformed into a horrible, demonic creature and attacked

us. We managed to slay him, but I feared I was dead, too,

because I could not go on.

What happened to the prince? asked Silinda, putting the

salve jar back into her pack and getting out her blanket.

I dont know, said the man miserably. He must have run

off into the forest. I have truly failed.

Theres a burrow nearby that my family has used for

hiding at times, said Silinda. Sleep there tonight; you will

be safe.

You are most kind, said the man, drawing the blanket

around him. I have nothing to give you, but someday I will

do you a good turn, said the man.

When she had made sure the man was comfortable, Sil-

inda departed. I was going to sleep in the burrow myself

tonight, thought Silinda, but now I will just have to nd

another place.

So on she walked into the gathering dusk. Rain began

to fall, soaking her to the skin. Then, over the splash of the

raindrops, she heard a small sound, like someone crying. She

followed the noise until she came to a cave. Looking inside,

she could see a tunnel mouth blocked by a pile of rubble.

From somewhere beyond it came the sound.

Silinda drew her sword and began digging at the stones

blocking the tunnel. Hours later, as she was prying at a

particularly large rock, her blade broke. Fortunately, there

isnt much farther to go, she muttered. She managed to clear

the last bit, and out crawled a small human boy, no more than

ten years old. His once-rich clothes hung in tatters, and his

face was dirty, but he was unharmed.

Thank you, he cried. I saw that horrible creature and

. . . and I ran. And then I ran in here, and the tunnel fell in

behind me.

Fortunately,  not  on  you,  said  Silinda,  putting  her

broken blade back into its scabbard. Wed better get you

to safety.

Silinda and the child made their way to the gates of a nearby

human city. It had evidently been a quiet nightthe gate

guard seemed to have fallen asleep. Silinda lifted the child

through the gate and began to creep quietly past the guard.

Then  she  noticed  the  sheathed  dagger  at  his  belt.  I  dont

have a sword, she thought. But his dagger would do. And I

might need a weapon here in the city. She slowly removed

the guards dagger from its sheath and slid her own broken

blade in to replace it.

Hold! cried another voice. Stop, thief! Evidently, there

were two guards on duty. Silinda led the second guard a

merry chase, but eventually she was caught, searched, and

imprisoned. The guards took her pack with her fresh clothes

and her thieves tools. A professional thief, eh? Tomorrow

youll be hanged, promised the guard.

Now Silinda huddled miserably in her wet clothes with

no weapon, no food, and no blanket. But something good

could still happen, she thought to herself.

Sure enough, just before dawn she smelled a lovely scent.

A freshly baked mufn ew through the bars on the window

of her cell. As it fell to the cot beside her, the pixie leader

appeared. We followed you, he said. And I thought you

might be hungry.

Thank  you  so  much,  said  Silinda,  munching  on  the

mufn. Now all I have to do is get out of here.

I can take care of that, said a voice outside her cell. There

stood the guard who had lain wounded on the road the night

before. The pixies told me you were in trouble, so I got back

as quickly as I could. Ive just relieved the guard on duty here.

He unlocked her cell as he spoke and handed Silinda her

bag. Everything that was in it is still there, he said. Now

get going.

Thank you! said Silinda. You saved my life!

As you saved mine, little one. Now dont tarry.

Silinda changed into dry clothes, then made her way

silently through the corridors of the kings dungeon. Several

times, she had to hide when loud footsteps thundered past.

Apparently, they had come for her at rst light and found

her missing. Finally she reached the main entrance. Two

bowstring  twangs  sounded  from  behind  her,  and  both

guards fell asleep. Thanking her pixie friend once again, she

slipped outside.

Who are you? called a voice from the gallows nearby. I

was told there would be a little woman hanged today, and

they cant seem to nd her. Perhaps it is you? The burly

executioner regarded her suspiciously.

Backing away warily, Silinda tried to look like a human

child as she said, N-no . . . I was just bringing some food for

the prisoners. My mother sent it over.

Clearly not mollied, the executioner started in her direc-

tion. She tells the truth, said another voice, and Silinda felt her

arm grabbed. Looking up, she saw the hunter she had rescued

from the net. Come with me, he said, pulling her along.

Thanking him profusely under her breath, Silinda fol-

lowed. But where are we going? she asked. To see the king,

replied her escort.

Not certain that this was a good idea, Silinda tried to

wriggle free, but he kept hold of her arm until they reached

the kings audience chamber. Here she is, said the hunter,

releasing her. Silinda, remembering her manners, bowed

before the king and introduced herself.

I understand I am deeply in your debt, said the king.

My son and heir has told me how you rescued him from the

blocked tunnel, and my guardsman has told me how you cut

him free from the orc trap. Please accept my apologies for

your detention and near execution.

I was glad to help, your majesty, replied Silinda.

To express my gratitude for all you have done, I bestow

upon you twenty acres of land just beyond the city gates. It

is good farmland, but you may use it in any way you wish.

Thank  you,  your  majesty,  replied  Silinda.  But  I  was

planning to travel and seek my fortune.

The  king  frowned.  Then  I  bestow  the  gift  upon  your

people. As long as any haling lives upon it, the land belongs

to your race. Should it ever be completely abandoned, it reverts

to the throne. Does that sound fair?

More than fair, your majesty! said Silinda, thinking

what a pleasant place of retirement property such a piece of

land might make for the older ones in her caravan. Thank

you again!

Silinda and the pixies departed the city and set off to nd

her people, stopping to pilfer a bit of fruit and bread from

the market stalls for their breakfast along the way. After all,

she was still hungry and hadnt wanted to bother the king

with such tries.

When  they  located  the  caravan  and  Silinda  related  her

story, several of the elders of the community decided to go

to their new land and make a permanent settlement. They

established stores and services, a school, and numerous

homes. The center of the property remained open, to provide

a campsite for any haling that came through. Thus was born

Arendalla, the rst permanent haling community.

Adventure Hook: A ruthless human merchant has dis-

covered a vein of gold in the earth below Arendalla and has

decided to get rid of the halings so that he can buy the land

from the current king. To that end, he has begun killing and

kidnapping halings from the town while spreading rumors of

powerful undead. By this means, he hopes to engender enough

fear that the halings will all move on. Once the community

is vacated, ownership of the land reverts to the king, and the

merchant can offer to buy the worthless property.

Codey Lightfoot, the Dragon-Slayer

Once there lived a haling adventurer named Codey Light-

foot. He had adventured for many years with companions

of various races and had many thrilling stories to tell, but

he had not yet claimed a dragons hoard, and that fact grated

upon him. He talked to his adventuring companionstwo

dwarves  named  Hurley  and  Munro,  and  a  human  named

Lodonand told them of his plans. They agreed to his plan

and packed up some paints, brushes, marbles, picks, shovels,

a few magic potions, several packets of lich dust poison,

weapons, and some food and water. Then they set off into

the desert for the lair of a blue dragon that Codey had heard

about. He had also heard that this particular dragon wasnt

quite as bright as the rest of his kind.

For  many  days  they  traveled.  The  land  grew  ever  more

barren. The roads petered out to paths, then to hard-packed

trails, then to nothing at all. At last, they spied a rocky crag

rising from the desert oor.

Circling  it,  they  heard  the  snoring  of  a  large  creature

coming from a cave mouth at the top of the crag. Sneaking

inside, Codey beheld a blue dragon asleep on the oor and a

pool of fresh water in a raised rock formation at the far end.

Meanwhile, the dwarves and the human investigated below

and proclaimed the crag suitable for their plans.

Codey sneaked back into the cavern and began to paint the

dragons scales. The other three began to dig at the mountain

below the cavern oor. Then Codey took up a position at the

mouth of the cavern and waited.

to the throne. Does that sound fair?

More than fair, your majesty! said Silinda, thinking

what a pleasant place of retirement property such a piece of

land might make for the older ones in her caravan. Thank

you again!

Silinda and the pixies departed the city and set off to nd

her people, stopping to pilfer a bit of fruit and bread from

the market stalls for their breakfast along the way. After all,

she was still hungry and hadnt wanted to bother the king

with such tries.

When  they  located  the  caravan  and  Silinda  related  her

story, several of the elders of the community decided to go

to their new land and make a permanent settlement. They

established stores and services, a school, and numerous

homes. The center of the property remained open, to provide

a campsite for any haling that came through. Thus was born

Arendalla, the rst permanent haling community.

Adventure Hook: A ruthless human merchant has dis-

covered a vein of gold in the earth below Arendalla and has

decided to get rid of the halings so that he can buy the land

from the current king. To that end, he has begun killing and

kidnapping halings from the town while spreading rumors of

powerful undead. By this means, he hopes to engender enough

fear that the halings will all move on. Once the community

is vacated, ownership of the land reverts to the king, and the

merchant can offer to buy the worthless property.

Codey Lightfoot, the Dragon-Slayer

Once there lived a haling adventurer named Codey Light-

foot. He had adventured for many years with companions

of various races and had many thrilling stories to tell, but

he had not yet claimed a dragons hoard, and that fact grated

upon him. He talked to his adventuring companionstwo

dwarves  named  Hurley  and  Munro,  and  a  human  named

Lodonand told them of his plans. They agreed to his plan

and packed up some paints, brushes, marbles, picks, shovels,

a few magic potions, several packets of lich dust poison,

weapons, and some food and water. Then they set off into

the desert for the lair of a blue dragon that Codey had heard

about. He had also heard that this particular dragon wasnt

quite as bright as the rest of his kind.

For  many  days  they  traveled.  The  land  grew  ever  more

barren. The roads petered out to paths, then to hard-packed

trails, then to nothing at all. At last, they spied a rocky crag

rising from the desert oor.

Circling  it,  they  heard  the  snoring  of  a  large  creature

coming from a cave mouth at the top of the crag. Sneaking

inside, Codey beheld a blue dragon asleep on the oor and a

pool of fresh water in a raised rock formation at the far end.

Meanwhile, the dwarves and the human investigated below

and proclaimed the crag suitable for their plans.

Codey sneaked back into the cavern and began to paint the

dragons scales. The other three began to dig at the mountain

below the cavern oor. Then Codey took up a position at the

mouth of the cavern and waited.

Eventually the dragon stirred, opened one great yellow

eye, and saw Codey. Who are you and what are you doing

in my lair? it roared.

My name is Codey, and I was on my way across the desert

when  I  heard  someone  crying  out  in  pain,  he  said.  So  I

climbed up here to see if I could be of any assistance. Where

does it hurt?

It doesnt hurt anywhere, the dragon snorted. But youre

going to hurt quite a bit when I eat you.

Well, you could certainly do that, said Codey. But I dont

think meat would be good for you right now, and besides,

Im so puny Id only be a half-bite for you.

Why wouldnt meat be good for me? said the dragon

in confusion.

Because youre sick, thats why, said Codey. Look at

yourself.

The dragon turned his head back on his great, snakelike

neck and gazed at his body. Whats happened to me? he

roared, seeing the lighter blue scales interspersed with his

dark blue ones.

Id say its a classic case of divermenticosis, said Codey. Its

a rare disease of dragons. I read about it while I was studying

my uncles books.

Never heard of it, said the dragon. I should just eat you.

Well, it might not be that, said Codey. Youd be hearing

ringing in your ears too if you had it.

The dragon stopped to listen and heard the rhythmically

clanging hammers of the dwarves at work below. I do hear

something, the dragon said.

Oh dear, said the hal ing. Look, youd better not take

any chances. Ill stay here with you and try to cure you. It

might not be possible if the disease is too far advanced, but

you never know.

Arent you afraid Ill eat you? asked the dragon.

You  shouldnt  be  eating  any  meat.  You  should  stick  to

vegetables until youre well, said the hal ing. But you could

eat me any time. If you do it today, you wont know whether

I could have cured you.

I guess I dont feel so well after all, said the dragon. But

will I know if its getting worse?

If the disease is advancing, said Codey, your scales will

continue to lighten, and youll start to shrink. Thats because

it  makes  you  regress  back  to  an  egg.  And  youll  see  little

colored motes in front of your eyes when you wake up. So

let me know if any of that happens, wont you? Meanwhile,

Ill make you some medicine every day.

The dragon agreed and went to back to sleep. Codey set to

work looting the dragons hoard, stuf ng gold into bags and

replacing it with bags of rock that the dwarves had mined

from under the  oor. He stacked the rocks high and covered

them with gold pieces. The dwarves reported that, with the

humans help, they had cleared a 10-foot-square area beneath

the  oor and chipped away the underpinnings of the cavern

 oor until it was held by only a thin ring of rock.

Nodding, Codey repainted the dragons scales, stuck his

multicolored marbles into cracks in the cavern ceiling, and

drank  a  potion  of  growth  to  make  himself  taller.  Then  the

other three went below to chip away the remaining supports,

working evenly at three spots. Suddenly the  oor gave way

and fell as a whole piece, landing with a resounding crash

on the new  oor below.

Whazzat? said the dragon, waking with a start, as rock

chips and marbles rained down. Colors? I see colored motes!

said the dragon.

Oh, thats very bad, said Cody. Do you feel any smaller?

The dragon looked around. Well, you look bigger than you

did before, he said. And my treasure pile looks

bigger  too.  And  .  .  .  the  ceiling  looks

higher than it did before.

58

Codey uses cleverness to relieve the dragon of its hoard

Im afraid its getting worse, said Codey. I have a dose of

medicine ready. Here, drink this. Codey produced a bucket

of lich dust poison mixed with water, which the dragon

dutifully drank. Now get some sleep, he said.

Clearing the next ten feet of vertical space from beneath

the surface was easier because the plate of rock that made

up the cavern  oor was no longer attached. The dwarves and

the human simply left supports in place that could easily be

knocked out when they wanted to move the  oor down.

The next time they did so, the dragon woke again with a

start. This time, Hurley stood before him, wearing clothes

identical to Codeys and keeping his face turned away. Ive

shrunk again, wailed the dragon, noting that once again the

hal ing seemed taller, as did the cavern and the treasure pile.

Take your medicine, then; its right there in the bucket, said

Codey  from  his  hiding  place  beyond  Hurley.  The  dragon

drank again, and promptly fell asleep.

So it continued for the next few days. The dragon ate only

vegetables  and  drank  poison  every  day,  which  made  him

progressively weaker. Hurley, Munro, and Lodon chipped

away beneath the cavern  oor, dropping it more each day.

Meanwhile, Codey substituted more and more rocks for the

dragons treasure, which he cached at a safe distance from the

lair. When next the dragon woke, he saw Hurley under the

effect of a potion of growth. The next time he saw Lodon, and

then Lodon under the effect of a potion.

At last, the dwarves pronounced that they had reached the

level of an underground lake. When they cut away the  nal

bit of stone, it would destabilize the entire crag.

When  Codey  had  carried  off  the  last  of  the  dragons

treasure,  they  removed  the  final  supports,  and  all  four

friends ran for their lives. The cavern floor crashed down

and splashed into the lake below. The last thing the dragon

saw was stone falling in on him from above. Some say that,

too weak to claw his way out from under the avalanche, he

drowned in the lake. Others say he was so lean by this time

that he eventually wormed his way out, realized he had

been tricked, and has been looking for a certain halfling

ever since.

As for Codey, he split the take with his friends, and all

four of them left the desert as rich adventurers. Thereafter

Codey outwitted many more creatures, but those are tales

for other times.

Adventure Hook: One priceless item rumored to be in

the old dragons hoard was overlooked and now lies beneath

a deep layer of crumbled stone under the earth. Or perhaps

this is merely a lure planted by the vengeful dragon to

lure halflings to him as part of his revenge against the

trickster Codey.

LANGUAGE

Hal ing is a language dedicated more to practicality than

to beauty. Though it  ows and has a lyrical quality suitable

for the songs of bards, it is not as  uid as the language of

the elves.

Hal ing draws many terms from other languages, and new

words are added all the time to account for new objects and

new concepts that hal ings encounter. Often, a single word

may refer to a complex concept. For example, there might be

a single word for little green leaf and another for big red

leaf. Hal ings work this treasure trove of words, some with

very similar meanings, into rich tapestries of oral composi-

tion, and it enriches their songs and stories to a level that is

beyond translation.

The Hal ing tongue has many words for travel, wagon,

wheel, draft animal, and other concepts relating to move-

ment, but few for home and hearth. Hal ing is ill-suited for

describing cities, industries, or other settled pursuits, but it is

richly detailed when speaking of nature, travel, and cultures.

It  is  also  quite  appropriate  for  clandestinely  exchanging

information  during  the  planning  and  execution  of  heists

and con dence ploys.

Most hal ing words are short, only one or two syllables;

most seemingly long words are in fact compounds. As with

Elven, subjects are often left out of sentences, particularly

when they are pronouns. Gestures can add another dimension

of meaning to the words and sometimes enable hal ings to

communicate about multiple topics at once.

HALFLING PHRASEBOOK

The following phrases and idioms are common in hal ing

culture, so hal ing PCs may utter them from time to time.

Translations tend to take up more space than the Hal ing ver-

sions because Hal ing words encompass complex meanings.

You can use either the actual Hal ing words or the Common

translations, depending on your style at the gaming table.

Guil dulutane sig thibu nis balant rilldi. The rabbit can dine

royally only once unless it knows the whereabouts of the

farmers dog. This phrase is one of many sayings that basi-

cally means Thou shalt not get caught. This saying also

admonishes the listener to look before leaping.

Galanmo  gort  silmat  revora.  The  householders  disdain

for the vagabond hides a hint of jealousy. This saying is an

af rmation of the hal ing zest for travel and new experiences.

It also serves as a curt dismissal of folk who jeer at hal ings

for their wandering ways.

Sitreere tuamo; dric rudanto. Sithi murant, la mento ulatir soba

tua mo rudo. A horse is tall and strong; a pony is short and

nimble. Each is content with her lot, and neither feels the

need to remind the other which is the taller or the shorter.

This saying is a reminder that different kinds of folk have

different capabilities, and a warning against braggarts and

folks who jeer. A horse knows its taller than a pony, and a

pony that its smaller than a horse; each is the right size for

what it is.

Issme milta issnoventu; sopi ginutawesin ventu. A place thats

a feast for the eyes and the senses is a movable feast; you carry

the memory of it wherever you go. Another af rmation of

hal ing wanderlust, this saying reminds the listener that a

person need not tarry somewhere to experience its joys. Just

move on and savor the memory.

Donta muden sito Donta likin menligrunti la danko. Find-

ing a gullible person is like nding a purse in the roadtake

it quickly and move on. Fortune can come in many forms, so

make the best of your opportunities. Still, dont hang around

in one place waiting for more. If you wait on the road for

another purse to drop, youll eventually be run over. Likewise,

if you stick around after conning someone, youll certainly

be caught.

Kendit hilto pintith ento nitli. A lie is a spear with a point

at each end. It can be useful to tell a lie once in a while, but

like a two-headed spear, it can skewer you if you push it in

too hard.

Rundo enka rindo, endi likni supa, la mento illli nitka sento. A

wheels rim is round, but its spokes are straight, and neither

is any good without the other. This saying is a reminder that

disparate elements can work together to form a useful whole.

Paditma sinti bimini nibit, endi paditnim sinti latamin. A

bird in the hand means a morsel on the table, but a bird in

the bush means song in the morning. These words remind

the listener that some efforts might produce inferior results

in the long run. Sometimes it is best to let things develop

before acting.

Sobenit rill modot allin vento mit soga. Wenlit modit gimlit

vemit mil nodoti. Pity the farmer who curses the rain because

it might spoil the hay. Yesterday he cursed the drought

because it was spoiling the roots. This saying is a warning

against seeing the cloud around every silver lining. It is also

a jibe toward sedentary folk.

HALFLING LETTERING

The Haling alphabet consists of twenty-two characters and

uses the Common script. Since so little is written down in

Haling, few studies have been done on how its rendering

differs from Common.

NAMING

Unlike dwarves or elves, who bear their names with pride,

halings do not attach great importance to names. Although

a haling does not change her clan name (unless it becomes

advisable to do so in order to avoid difculties), she may use

and discard several names over the course of her life as her

circumstances and perspective change.

Each haling name consists of one or more name fragments

(from Table 22) and possibly an earned name (from Table

23). When combining two haling name fragments, an o

or ee is frequently added between them. Female haling

names  sometimes  double  the  last  consonant  and  add  an

-a (thus, Furgren becomes Furgrenna). If you dont like a

particular combination, try adding an a, i, or y between

the name fragments, or add -en or -enna to the end. Not

every combination of name fragments will sound right; if you

cant make a particular name work, try to create one with a

similar meaning.

The denitions for haling names sometimes end up being

no more than a list of pleasant things. Calopee might mean

cheese  and  riddles  and  still  be  a  well-respected  haling

name. Of course, it might also mean the timeless questor

it might mean both. Halings enjoy playing with their names

denitions and might decide to change a denition just to

confuse a friend or member of another race.

Earned names are descriptors or titles given to individuals

after some important or heroic event. Although these names

were once given in the halings native tongue, they are

now usually in the Common tongue due to the inuence of

human culture. A haling character might acquire an earned

name during game play or start the game with an earned

name. An earned name can be randomly determined by

rolling twice on Table 23, or you can choose one to match

a characters personality.

money in their wagons, feeling this makes them attractive

targets to bandits. Since most halfling caravans operate

like extended families anyway (and some are, when the

clans are closely related), this system comes naturally to

its members.

However, halings do regularly trade with outsiders, and

they do accumulate money. On rare occasions, halflings

within the same caravan may pay one another in money for

goods or services, but such transactions are frowned upon.

Money is usually reserved for commerce with outsiders.

Halflings  sell  their  goods  and  services  and  accumulate

cash reserves to tap when needed. They deposit most of

their cash with a banker, a settled halfling either in a

large human city or in a permanent halfling town. Though

some bankers use or invest money in a depositors absence,

most leave it buried, hidden, or safely cached on their

property, knowing that the depositor can ask for all of it

at a moments notice.

Haling communities do not mint any coins of their own,

though they do sometimes melt down recognizable treasure

and form it into jewelry or gold bars. Halings know the value

of all other cultures currency, and bankers can change one

currency to another for a small fee.

HALFLING CARAVANS

AND TOWNS

Most  halings  spend  their  lives  wandering  from  place  to

place, with lengthy stops wherever they nd pleasure and

prot. Most of this traveling is done by wagon in caravans,

but some is by boat.

A campsite is chosen based on the length of the proposed

stay. A site for a one-night stay should be defensible, have a

sizable clear space for wagons, and provide some water and

grazing  for  the  animals.  It  should  also  be  free  of  obvious

predators and preferably out of sight of hostile forces such

as orc bands. In addition to the above, a site for a longer stay

requires a good water source, abundant hunting, wood for

res and for wagons, and plenty of wild roots and berries

for gathering. Halings rarely worry about replanting what

they have taken; they simply move on when resources run

low and trust to nature to replenish the land over time.

Selection of a site for a permanent settlement is something

of a serendipitous process because it depends largely on the

charity of those who own the land. Defense, water, wood,

food, and grazing lands are all desirable, but halings learn

to make do with the lands to which they receive rights. The

best  lands  have  not  only  the  basic  resources  but  also  raw

materials for various crafts.

A  permanent  haling  settlement  is  described  below  as

both a reference for DMs looking to design their own and

as a location for use in a campaign that features halings.

HALFLING ECONOMY

Within a haling community, most commerce is done on a

barter system; halings do not like to carry large amounts of

EXAMPLE SETTLEMENT:

FANTAS MEADOW

Fantas  Meadow  is  situated  on  a  forty-acre  piece  of  mead-

owland  adjoining  several  farms  in  a  rural  area  populated

by humans. A stream cuts through the southern half of the

meadow, providing water for the crops the halings choose

to grow and for their orchards. The soil is rich, and about

one-fourth of the land is naturally wooded. A rocky ridge

stretches along the northern side of the property.

The town was named for the haling clan leader who

negotiated its use. The land was deeded to the halings in

perpetuity by a grateful human wizard for whom the halings

did a great favor.

The business section of Fantas Meadow consists of two

long, rambling, two-story buildings that stretch for a quarter-

mile and more on either side of a wide main street. These

structures house a number of shops, all of which connect

with one another. A customer can literally walk through

two dozen shops without leaving the shelter of the build-

ing. Crafting areas, such as forges and ovens, often extend

outdoors, behind the row of shops. The proprietor of each

shop can fence goods related to his or her craft.

Toward the south end of town is an immense open area

where caravans can park. At either end of this area are taverns

that have a few rooms for rent.

The ridge on the north side of town contains numerous bur-

rows hollowed out from the stone and secured with wooden

doors. A few of the townspeople live in these underground

homes, but most live in rooms above their shops. Most of

these burrows belong to traveling halings who come here

to stay during seasons of inclement weather. The typical

burrow consists of a kitchen, a living room, a family room,

ing a gullible person is like nding a purse in the roadtake

it quickly and move on. Fortune can come in many forms, so

make the best of your opportunities. Still, dont hang around

in one place waiting for more. If you wait on the road for

another purse to drop, youll eventually be run over. Likewise,

if you stick around after conning someone, youll certainly

be caught.

Kendit hilto pintith ento nitli. A lie is a spear with a point

like a two-headed spear, it can skewer you if you push it in

Rundo enka rindo, endi likni supa, la mento illli nitka sento. A

wheels rim is round, but its spokes are straight, and neither

disparate elements can work together to form a useful whole.

bird in the hand means a morsel on the table, but a bird in

the bush means song in the morning. These words remind

the listener that some efforts might produce inferior results

in the long run. Sometimes it is best to let things develop

before acting.

Sobenit rill modot allin vento mit soga. Wenlit modit gimlit

it might spoil the hay. Yesterday he cursed the drought

because it was spoiling the roots. This saying is a warning

against seeing the cloud around every silver lining. It is also

a jibe toward sedentary folk.

HALFLING LETTERING

The Haling alphabet consists of twenty-two characters and

uses the Common script. Since so little is written down in

Haling, few studies have been done on how its rendering

differs from Common.

NAMING

Unlike dwarves or elves, who bear their names with pride,

halings do not attach great importance to names. Although

a haling does not change her clan name (unless it becomes

advisable to do so in order to avoid difculties), she may use

and discard several names over the course of her life as her

circumstances and perspective change.

Each haling name consists of one or more name fragments

(from Table 22) and possibly an earned name (from Table

23). When combining two haling name fragments, an o

or ee is frequently added between them. Female haling

and one or more bedrooms. All have earthen  oors, but the

walls are plastered or paneled with wood.

The  current  leader  of  Fantas  Meadow  is  Justicia  Wain-

wright, great-great-granddaughter of Fanta. Justicia lives in

a modest burrow home with her family and tends to town

business from an of ce in the east commercial sector.

Farms  surround  the  settlement  on  all  sides,  providing

grain, vegetables, and meat animals for slaughter. Each farm

features a small house for the family.

Central Temple: On the west side of town, just before the

tree line, stands a building with several wings radiating out

from the middle like the spokes of a wheel. These spokes

are  connected  by  a  ring  of  open  gardens.  This  building

houses  shrines  to  each  of  the  hal ing  deitiesArvoreen,

Brandobaris, Cyrrollalee, Sheela Peryroyl, Urogalan, and

Dallah Thaunalong with their resident clergy. Each spoke

is devoted to a different god, but the one that contains Dallahs

shrine is concealed behind a secret door. The round central

chamber is Yondallas shrine.

The central chamber can contain the whole community

if need be, and the temple is stocked with enough supplies

in  underground  larders  to  support  the  community  for

a month.

Caravan Circle: This large open area on the south end

of town is provided as a place for hal ing caravans to camp.

It can accommodate up to sixty wagons comfortably. When

caravans stop here, they usually unpack all their gear, inspect

everything and repair whatever needs it, trade for what they

need, cache money with the banker (see below), and restock

their  food  supplies.  Then  they  pack  everything  back  into

their wagons and continue on their way. The average stay is

two weeks.

At present, two caravans, each with twenty wagons, are

camped at this site. One plans to leave in three days; the other

has just arrived.

Party Tree: In a clearing in the wooded section of town

stands a huge oak tree with spreading branches that form a

canopy of sorts. The community uses this area for revels of

various kinds, often hanging lanterns from the boughs of

the tree and decorating its trunk and branches with strings

of beads, braided leather thongs dyed in various shades, and

other embellishments suitable for the occasion at hand.

East Commercial Buildings: This area houses a black-

smith, a wainwright, a wheelwright, a general store, a potter, a

butcher, a bakery, a candle shop, a guide service, a mapmaker,

a  cobbler,  and  a  cabinet-maker  who  doubles  as  the  towns

banker. It also contains the of ce of the community leader,

Justicia Wainwright.

West Commercial Buildings: This area houses a tinker, a

joiner, a tailor, a weaver, a moneychanger, a jeweler, a weapon-

smith and armorsmith, an herbalist, a miller, a magic shop,

a woodworker, and an animal trader/trainer.

Stockyard: Atop the ridge is an immense paddock divided

into  several  sections  to  house  various  livestock.  Horses,

ponies, donkeys, cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, rabbits, and chick-

ens are kept here for trade to caravans or for sale to residents.

A large barn and chicken coop on the north side provides

shelter for the animals in inclement weather and storage for

their tack.

Taverns: The Pin Oak and the Merry Rogue both provide

meals and a typical selection of wines, ales, and beers, but

the Merry Rogue has the better selection of drinks, while

the Pin Oak has the better food. Below the Pin Oak is a safe

house and thieves guild for rogues. Each inn has ten rooms

for rent plus a common room.

School: At the west end of Burrow Ridge stands a small

building that serves as a school for youngsters both of the

community and of the caravans that stop here. It provides

a  modicum  of  book  learning  for  those  who  would  not

otherwise get much. Reading, writing, and arithmetic are

taught here, along with the history of the hal ing race and

other races.

CREATING HALFLING

CHARACTERS

A hal ing can quickly make herself unwelcome in a party of

adventurers if the character is roleplayed to the full extent of

her racial personality. No one wants to be in a group with a

hal ing who is constantly running off in search of trouble or

stealing from her companions. However, when they are used

in moderation, such hal ing traits as curiosity, fearlessness,

larceny, and wanderlust can make for an interesting character

and a welcome adventuring companion. Hal ings can hold

their own in melee combat, but they truly shine in ranged

combat, particularly with thrown weapons.

Though hal ings are familiar to just about anyone who has

played in fantasy settings, halflings in  the D&D game do

not have all the characteristics of their literary and cinematic

counterparts. They are generally neutral in alignment, which

gives a wide range of options for character traits and profes-

sions. The hal ing rogue is a classic type, but hal ings can

function well in a number of roles.

No matter what class you choose for your hal ing character,

consider spending some skill points on Climb, Hide, Jump,

Listen, and Move Silently, even if those are cross-class skills

for you.

As a hal ing, you qualify for some speci c feats and pres-

tige classes (described in this book and elsewhere) that are

unavailable to PCs of other races.

Feats: Dallah Thauns Luck, Yondallas Sense.

Prestige Classes: Hal ing outrider (see Complete Warrior),

luckstealer, whisperknife.

HALFLINGS AS CHARACTERS

Due to their racial abilities and cultural norms, hal ings

make exceptional rogues. Nevertheless, the hal ings bonus

to Dexterity also stands her in good stead as an archer or

a member of any fighting class, opening a wide array of

class options.

Barbarian:  Hal ing  barbarians  are  not  common;  most

hal ings thrive on regular contact with other societies and

thus pick up a modicum of civility. However, a few haling

caravans, cut off from other lands generations ago by some

natural disaster, could have reverted to a wilder state.

Barbarian may seem  like  a poor choice  for a  halfling

because of his racial penalty to Strength, but the rage abil-

ity helps to make up for that deficiency, and a halflings

high Dexterity provides a good Armor Class. Furthermore,

because of his small size and his racial bonus on thrown

weapons,  a  halfling  barbarian  can  be  quite  effective  in

ranged combat.

Bard: Song and story are the foundation of the halings

strong oral tradition, so bard is a natural choice for character

class. A bard can be a valuable addition to a haling caravan

because of her ability to support and enhance the abilities of

others, and the haling racial skill bonuses augment many

of the bards class skills. Haling bards are also welcome in

other communities, so they can serve as heralds to announce

the arrival of their caravans and shills to spread rumors that

may later support condence schemes.

Cleric: Haling clerics can use magic stone to take advan-

tage of their racial bonus with thrown weapons, bulls strength

to make up for their racial penalty to Strength, and searing

light  to  take  advantage  of  the  racial  bonus  to  Dexterity.  A

number  of  cleric  spells  can  also  augment  rogue  abilities,

thus complementing the halings favored class. Obscuring

mist and darkness can aid in hiding, command and enthrall can

help  confuse  marks  or  keep  enemies  from  attacking,  and

locate object can help nd loot.

Druid: Halings often feel an afnity for the druid class

because of the amount of time they spend outdoors in their

travels.  The  druids  wild  shape  ability  can  help  a  haling

overcome limitations imposed by his small size and provide

an excellent disguise to boot. The trackless step and woodland

stride class features let a haling move freely without being

tracked, and speak with animals and speak with plants can be

used to gather considerable information about an area and

the people in it. In addition, druids have access to magic stone

and obscuring mist, just as clerics do, in addition to some useful

spells clerics do not have, such as fog cloud.

For  alternative  options  for  the  haling  druid,  see  the

haling racial substitution levels on page 157.

Fighter: A haling ghter is at a disadvantage compared

to ghters of other races because of her penalty to Strength,

but this choice becomes a much more viable one when feat

choices play to the halings strengths. Weapon Focus makes

a halings ranged attacks even more deadly, and Weapon

Finesse allows a haling to take advantage of her Dexter-

ity for melee combat. Furthermore, two of the halings

racial skill bonuses (Climb and Jump) play directly into the

ghters class skills, so each point spent on one of those skills

goes farther.

Monk: Halings who appreciate order sometimes choose

the  path  of  monk.  Though  such  discipline  seems  at  odds

with  a  halings  curiosity,  racial  penalty  to  Strength,  and

sometimes short attention span, monk can be a surprisingly

effective class choice for halings. A halings racial bonus

to Dexterity and her size bonus help both her Armor Class

and her attacks. The monks fast movement gets a haling

out of scrapes more quickly, and slow fall can also save her

bacon. Combat Reexes and Weapon Finesse are excellent

feat choice for haling monks, because these play directly

to their high Dexterity. Furthermore, the monks abundant

step ability can get a haling monk into places she couldnt

normally  goalways  a  plus  for  a  character  with  a  bit  of

larceny in her soul.

For  alternative  options  for  the  haling  monk,  see  the

haling racial substitution levels on page 158.

Paladin:  Halfling  paladins  have  the  same  kinds  of

drawbacks and opportunities that haling barbarians and

ghters do, and the same feat and skill choices are useful.

Though not all haling deities are lawful good, paladins

of Yondalla are reasonably common, and they are much

respected for their ability to take care of their communi-

ties in the goddesss name. A paladin can provide healing

and  keep  evil  at  bay,  and  his  aura  of  courage  helps  his

companions take heart.

Ranger: Haling rangers face the same limitations and

opportunities as haling barbarians, ghters, and paladins,

and  the  same  feat  and  skill  choices  are  useful.  Haling

rangers excel at hiding, thanks to their small size and high

Dexterity. The rangers archery combat style is an excellent

choice  for  a  haling,  but  two-weapon  ghting  isnt  a  bad

choice  either,  especially  if  the  character  has  the  Weapon

Finesse feat and ghts with two light weapons.

Rogue: Rogue is the favored class for halings because it

plays to the races strengths in almost all ways. Small, quick,

and quiet, halings are adept at sneaking into places secured

against entry and at appropriating goods covertly. Their racial

skill bonuses all play directly to the rogues best skills, and

their racial bonus to Dexterity gives them a benet on numer-

ous other rogue skills as well as to Armor Class. In addition,

halings have no trouble inltrating other societies because

their travels make them ubiquitous.

For  alternative  options  for  the  haling  rogue,  see  the

haling racial substitution levels on page 159.

Sorcerer:  Though  they  do  not  have  the  innate  affin-

ity  for  arcane  magic  that  elves  do,  halflings  can  make

very practical use of it. Evocations are handy for driving

intruders away from caravans, and ray spells make use of

a  halflings  racial  bonus  to  Dexterity.  That  same  bonus

combined with the halflings small size provides a hefty

bonus to Armor Class, which comes in handy for any sor-

cerer. In addition, a halfling can choose from a variety of

familiars that play to his racial strengths because of the

skill bonuses they provide.

Wizard:  Haling  wizards  can  be  even  more  versatile

than sorcerers because of the larger number of spells they

have available. A haling wizard can play to her strengths

by  choosing  spells  such  as  true  strike  and  haste.  For  those

occasions when she wants to function more like a spellcaster

than a magically augmented ghter, she can merely select a

different set of spells.

he cliff-dwelling raptorans are avian humanoids

who dwell in canyon walls and other precipices.

Possessed  of  feathered  wings,  they  soar  high

above  their  desert  and  mountain  homes,  using

their sharp eyesight to hunt for food and defend

their homes.

After the meal, Kalithi spread her wings and glided down

from her familys cliff dwelling to join her age-mates

Risili and Vangila in a favorite tree on the canyon floor.

Tonight we practice with footbows, said Vangila. I

checked the roster.

I do better with spikes, said Risili sourly. Well, maybe

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Kalithi Nightwing stretched and yawned as she emerged

from sleep. She could hear the melody of the moonsong

drifting through her familys nest. Moonrise was a magic

timethe start of a new twilight, when all things were still

possible. She leaped out of the cozy nest of unspun wool that

served as her bed and rolled back the leather curtain over

the T-shaped window in her cliff-chamber. The sunset to the

west was already fading, and the moonlight was beginning

to wash the eastern sky with silver.

Mealtime! called her mother. There was nothing like food

to motivate a young raptoran, and Kalithi was no exception.

She hurriedly donned a pair of breeches and pulled her tunic

over her head, then carefully unfolded her wings through

the openings in the back. She tossed her blanket over her

bed and ran to the kitchen, where her parents were already

seated at the table. Kalithi helped herself to rabbit sausage

fried with apples, cider, and wild plum compote.

theyll let us go out for a hunt afterward.

Yes, berry-gathering and weaving baskets isnt nearly

as much fun, agreed Kalithi.

The  three  joined  their  other  age-mates  on  the

practice tree and took up their footbows. Shoot, then

glide, then shoot againin pairs, said the instructor

crisply. Risili and Kalithi paired off and took aim

at two straw-and-stick targets thrown into the air.

Then the two pushed off from the tree and spiraled

around it, nocking new arrows and ring off nearly

simultaneous shots at a second set of targets. Too

slow, Kalithi, called the instructor. Practice seemed

to go on forever, but eventually Kalithi and Risili

managed to coordinate their shots well enough to

satisfy the instructor.

The three age-mates climbed rope ladders to the

cliff dwelling, stopping briey to watch Kalithis aunt

arrange prisms for a light display in a cave entrance. Flat-

bread baked from acorn our topped with groundnut

butter and some late raspberries made a tasty repast.

thought as she composed herself for sleep. Perhaps Ill nd out

soon when I can begin my walk.

We get to hunt! cried Risili, and all of Kalithis age-mates

dove out of the dwelling door and into midair, the remains

of their lunches forgotten.

Descending  back  to  the  canyon  floor,  Risili,  Kalithi,

and  Vangila  joined  three  of  the  male  age-mates  of  their

hatching  under  the  direction  of  an  older  leader  capable

of true ight. Taking up their bows, the young raptorans

crept through the scrubby underbrush of the canyon oor

while the leader soared overhead, indicating with a gesture

whenever his keen eyes spotted game. Kalithi and Risili

downed  a  rabbit  each,  and  Vangila

bagged a mole. No one got more than

one  animal,  but  it  was  a  good  hunt.

When Im able to y, Ill be a truly great

hunter, Kalithi thought.

Returning  to  camp,  they  cleaned

their kills and handed them off

to the supply chief, who deboned

and sliced the meat for drying.

Their parents would take care of

the  game  for  the  familys  meals;

the  young  raptorans  kills  were

considered excess and were stored

as winter food.

After  a  supper  of  roast  boar

meat and potatoes, Kalithi and her

family enjoyed the berry pie her moth-

er  had  made

for dessert.

Then  they

adjourned  to

the Great Hall for

a debate. The topic

was whether to allow

a party of human adven-

turers to pass through the

west edge of the raptorans ter-

ritory. After an hour of discussion,

the ock voted to grant permission.

Since it was still two hours before moonset

and the weather was ne, Kalithi decided to

practice using her wings. She leaped high into

the sky from her perch atop the cliff and glided all

the way across the canyon, descending gradually until she

landed against the far wall just a few feet above the canyon

oor.

Clutching the cliff wall with her talons, Kalithi laughed,

intoxicated by her longest glide to date. Then she hopped

down from her landing site to begin the long walk back

across the canyon oor. When she got to the bottom of the

cliff where her ock lived, she climbed up a dangling rope

ladder and found her way home.

Slipping into her room, Kalithi fell onto her bed, too tired

even to undress. My wings are getting strongerI can feel it, she

DESCRIPTION

Unlike the previous two chapters, which covered races previ-

ous described in the Players Handbook, this chapter gives a

full description of raptorans, their racial traits, and all other

information necessary for creating raptoran characters.

OVERVIEW

Raptorans are unique among the common races for their

ability to y. In ancient times, the raptorans made a pact

with the lords of the Elemental Plane

of Air, gaining the ability to y in

exchange  for  pledging  the  nest

warriors of their race to the service

of the air elementals in various extra-

planar battles. Although the elementals

have not called upon the raptorans for

assistance in generations, the pact entered

into by those distant ancestors continues to

shape raptoran society today.

To  ensure  that  only  the  ttest  and  most

capable  raptorans  are  available  to  ll  the

ranks of these would-be warriors, the agree-

ment  with  the  elementals  called  for

the raptorans to put their offspring

through a test of survival and self-

reliance called the Walk of the Four

Winds.  To  this  day,  every  member  of  a

raptoran  ock  must  undergo  this  trial

before becoming able to y. When the

ock chief judges a young adult rap-

toran to be ready for the walk, that

raptoran  can  leave  immediately

to start the test. Those who do not

leave  at  their  earliest  opportunity

are referred to by other members of

the community as gliders (reect-

ing their limited capacity to use

their wings).

The  pact  led  to  the  creation

of  the  skypledged,  who  draw

their  ranks  from  raptoran  druids

and clerics. By vowing to forgo earth, re, and water spells,

skypledged  gain  great  exiblity  in  spellcasting  as  well  as

ever-increasing  power  over  the  wind.  Skypledged  are  not

structured in a single great organization but scattered among

the tribes, each honoring the pact as he or she sees best. (The

skypledged prestige class is described starting on page 126.)

The pact also set out details regarding the creation of

the stormtalons, the organization of elite raptoran soldiers

who assist raptoran flocks that find themselves in danger.

(The  stormtalon  prestige  class  is  described  starting  on

page 131.)

Personality: Raptorans have a reputation for being deep

thinkers who always weigh their options carefully. Theyre

notorious for treating strangers coolly, yet theyre also slow

to judge and usually give newcomers ample time to prove

themselves worthy of friendship. They are slow to anger but

even slower to forgive an insult or injury.

When faced with uncertainty, raptorans usually retreat

to a safe distance and settle down to observe and ponder

the situation for a while. Their detractors dismiss this

behavior as cowardly or indecisive, yet raptorans are per-

fectly capable of improvising when the need arises, and

they generally stick to a task once they have decided how

to take it on. Raptorans seldom flee from danger; they just

back off a little.

Raptorans love to argue and debate, whether or not they

actually agree with the philosophy they are defending so

passionately.  They  do  not,  however,  waste  time  arguing

when danger threatens or when they perceive that time is

of the essence.

A raptorans cautious nature takes a back seat whenever

physical violence is imminent. In the blink of an eye, a rap-

torans demeanor can change from serene to erce. In combat,

raptorans attack their enemies with savage aggressiveness,

seeking overwhelming victory as quickly as possible.

Physical Description: Feathered wings are a raptorans

singular identifying feature. When fully outstretched, they

span 10 to 12 feet, although raptorans (when not ying) are

more comfortable with them folded behind their backs. An

interlocking  series  of  ligaments  allows  raptorans  to  lock

their wings in the outstretched position, enabling them to

glide for long periods without tiring. The wing feathers are

ordinarily white, with black-tipped feathers appearing more

often as a raptoran ages.

Raptorans  tend  to  be  thinner  and  slightly  taller  than

humans, with most of their extra height in their legs; their

arms  are  likewise  somewhat  longer.  They  average  just

over 6 feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds. Their legs

end in bony talons that arent particularly sharp but have

tremendous  gripping  strength.  Raptoran  hands  are  much

like human hands, but each nger ends in a thick, almost

clawlike ngernail. The race does not have facial hair, but

downy feathers on a raptorans scalp can resemble hair when

viewed at a distance. Some female raptorans have a row of

more substantial feathers running from earlobe to earlobe

across the back of the head and neck. Females can fan out

this neck ruff to display it; male raptorans consider a well-

groomed neck ruff to be attractive.

Raptoran clothing tends to be utilitarian and streamlined.

Garb thats heavy, restrictive, or too loose would impede

flight, so most raptorans rely on a close-fitting shirt and a

simple set of breeches. Because a raptorans feathered wings

provide better insulation than a down quilt, lightly dressed

raptorans are comfortable even in cold climes.

Raptoran  clothing  includes  straps  and  buckles  for

keeping pockets closed, because raptorans in flight would

otherwise  drop  coins  and  other  possessions.  Dangling

jewelry is disdained as an annoyance in flight. Raptorans

sometimes  dye  individual  wing  feathers  in  arresting

combinationsa decorative art not unlike the cosmetics

that some humans wear.

Relations: Strangers who meet raptorans usually receive

cordial but wary treatment. To a raptoran, any unfamiliar

being is potentially an ally or an enemy, and she keeps her

distance until she can be sure of a newcomers intentions.

Other creatures often consider raptorans to be aloof and

somewhat snobbish toward creatures that cannot y. The

truth of the matter is that while raptorans literally look down

on land-bound creatures, that situation is more a matter of

circumstance  than  of  arrogance.  Raptorans  instinctively

pity  creatures  that  cant  soar  on  the  winds,  but  theyre

introspective enough to realize that not  everyone shares

the desire to y.

As  hunters  and  ranchers  on  the  edge  of  civilization,

raptorans tend to be territorial. They tolerate travelers who

are  just  passing  through  their  territories,  but  they  expect

visitors  to  ask  permission  before  hunting  or  harvesting

forest plants in the area. Those who tarry overlong in rap-

toran territoryand those who settle too close for raptoran

comfortface  increasing  harassment  from,  and  eventual

war with, the raptorans.

Raptorans tend to be tolerant of other folk who come to

visit and not to stay. They often barter with gnomes and

halings, trading game, furs, and other products for metal

goods, cloth, and salt.

Raptorans regard most sylvan fey creatures as charming

but somewhat frivolous. Raptorans are no fools, and they treat

kobolds, goblins, orcs, and other warlike creatures with extra

caution. They nd dwarves somewhat odd, even comical to

look at because of their stout bodies and long beards. They

also think of dwarves as strange folk because of their habit

of living underground.

Alignment:  Raptorans  love  their  freedom  and  tend

strongly toward chaotic alignments. Their tribal structure

and small communities reect their individualism.

Raptorans also favor good over evil. They dislike excess and

never seek to dominate others or own more than they need.

They stand ready to give a helping hand to others in need,

as long as such help doesnt entangle them in the affairs of

far-off lands.

Raptoran Lands: A typical raptoran community lives

either  in  spiraling  towers  built  in  a  hollow  or  depression

halfway up a canyon cliff, or in large communal dwellings

excavated into the side of a cliff. Cliffs with overhangs and

southern  exposures  are  particularly  comfortable  for  rap-

torans. If a canyon has a prevailing breeze that blows through

it, raptorans regard that location as a particularly auspicious

place to live.

While raptorans do engage in some agriculture (mostly

fruit  orchards),  they  subsist  on  hunting  whatever  herd

animals  are  prevalent  near  their  cliff  dwellings.  Thus,

they usually live far from large settlements of other races,

in areas where game is plentiful and the hunting is good.

Some raptoran ocks tend herds of bison, deer, or elk near

their communities, taking some of the livestock each season

for food.

Religion: The goddess Tuilviel Glithien, the Queen of Air

and Night, is the raptorans primary deity. The raptorans call

her Lady of the Silent Wings or simply The Lady. Tuilviel

cherishes and protects all nocturnal birds. She is the patron

of the hunt and of the family.

Because many raptorans are druids, generalized nature wor-

ship is common among members of the race. Some raptorans,

especially arcane spellcasters, venerate powerful elementals

from the Elemental Plane of Air.

Language: Raptorans speak a uid and lyrical tongue they

call Tuilvilanuue. Ultimately derived from Elven but quite

distinct in its development, Tuilvilanuue has many long,

tongue-twisting words but simple grammar, relying on inec-

tion to convey much of its meaning. Written Tuilvilanuue

uses a simple form of the Elven script.

Most raptorans have a practical mind-set, so they conne

their writing to messages. Many raptoran songs, poems, and

histories exist, but the raptorans prefer memorizing these

to writing them down. Memories are lighter to carry than

books, a raptoran saying goes.

Names: A raptoran child receives a birth name from her

parents, which serves to identify the child as she grows up.

Sometime after the child reaches adolescence she acquires

a nicknameoccasionally from a ock elder but often a

sobriquet that just seems to stick. As a matter of practice,

only  members  of  a  raptorans  flock  may  refer  to  her  by

her  nickname,  and  even  then  they  only  do  so  when  no

strangers are present. Close friends and family members

often  continue  to  use  a  raptorans  birth  name  as  a  mark

of affection.

A raptoran may reveal her ock nickname to someone

outside the ock if she wishes, but no one else may do so.

Sharing ones ock nickname with an outsider is a mark of

deep respect, trust, or affection.

When a raptoran gains the ability to y under her own

power, she chooses an adult name for herself. In addition, a

raptoran has a family name, which is often a compound of

several descriptive Tuilvilanuue words.

For more on raptoran names, see page 82.

RAPTORAN RACIAL TRAITS

Raptoran base land speed is 30 feet.

Medium: As Medium creatures, raptorans have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Wing-Aided Movement: Raptorans can use their wings to

help with movement even if they cant y yet. The extra

lift from her wings gives a raptoran a +10 racial bonus on

Jump checks.

Gliding (Ex): A raptoran can use her wings to glide, negat-

ing damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of

forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Raptorans glide

at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability). Even if a

raptorans maneuverability improves, she cant hover while

gliding. A raptoran cant glide while carrying a medium

or heavy load.

If a raptoran becomes unconscious or helpless while

in midair, her wings naturally unfurl and powerful liga-

ments stiffen the wings. The raptoran descends in a tight

corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no

matter what the actual distance of the fall.

Flight (Ex): When a raptoran reaches 5 Hit Dice, she becomes

able to y at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability). A

raptoran cant y while carrying a medium or heavy load

or while fatigued or exhausted.

Raptorans  can  safely  fly  for  a  number  of  rounds

equal  to  their  Constitution  modifier  (minimum  1

round). They can exert themselves to fly for up to twice

as long, but then theyre fatigued at the end of the flight.

Raptorans are likewise fatigued after spending a total of

more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because raptorans

can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual

flight, they can remain aloft for extended periods (even

if they can only use flight for 1 round at a time without

becoming fatigued).

PSYCHOLOGY

Some outsiders who have had limited dealings with raptorans

claim they are contradictory to the point of being downright

intractable, and cautious to the point of being rude. In some

ways, such assessments are right on target, but those who

accept these assertions at face value havent taken the time

to get to know the raptorans.

When raptorans greet new people, they retreat instead of

moving forward. This seemingly odd behavior has a foun-

dation based on prudencethe raptorans natural caution

makes them seek distance and cover in case an encounter

turns ugly, and withdrawal also allows them to judge the

reactions of the other parties. Anyone who knows raptorans

realizes that the polite response is to take a step or two back-

ward so as to offer them greater space to movea courtesy

they appreciate.

THE RAPTORAN OUTLOOK

Raptorans dont have the life span of elves or dwarves, but

they take a similarly long view in their attitude toward their

place in the world. Because they are avid hunters who rely

on game remaining plentiful across a wide swath of land,

raptorans take care of the environment and avoid fouling

the places where they nest. They also take considerable time

to make up their minds about issues that do not require

instant  action.  They  can  debate  for  days  about  whether

to allow a given group of travelers access to their lands,

but should danger threaten they can mount a coordinated

defense within minutes.

Raptorans espouse a live and let live philosophy. Others

are welcome to their own ways, so long as they dont bother

the raptorans or despoil their lands. Raptorans respect the

lives and property of other creatures and do not deprive

them  of  either  without  due  consideration.  The  chaotic

nature of these winged beings is expressed through the

deep  debates  that  raptorans  engage  in  over  philosophi-

cal  issues  and  their  differences  in  personal  adornment.

Raptorans cooperate with others to the extent that they

nd it practical to do so, but they do not feel the need for

others approval and do not allow themselves to be used by

ostensible allies. The typical raptoran just wants to hunt at

twilight, debate philosophy late into the night, and gather

apples in the morning.

Naturally, not every raptoran agrees with this sentiment,

and individuals are welcome to differ with the majority.

Most  who  feel  the  need  to  pursue  more  ambitious  lives

eventually leave the ock for realms where more opportunity

exists. Such raptorans often become adventurers, at least for a

time. Many begin the Walk of the Four Winds at a relatively

early age and never return to their ock, even after they

have learned to y.

Raptorans who choose to live away from their ock are

a diverse lot. Some nd homes in great cities, where they

rejoice in the diversity of opinion and never-ending oppor-

tunities for debate. City-dwelling raptorans typically reside

in tall towers, nding them an acceptable substitute for the

cliff-homes of their people. Other raptorans settle in small

communities, especially rural ones surrounded by deep for-

ests. They are particularly attracted to elf camps and outposts,

which share the natural settings of raptoran communities.

A few raptorans embrace the adventuring life so thoroughly

that they do not settle down but move from place to place in

search of new challenges.

Because their way of life intentionally spurns material

acquisition, raptorans rarely display any sort of greed. They

take  what  they  need  from  the  environment  but  no  more,

trusting to nature and their goddess to provide for the future.

While they realize the convenience of coins as a trading

medium, they prefer to barter with skins, carvings, and

other handicrafts to gain the metals and manufactured goods

they require.

Raptorans place a high value on self-reliance. The coming-

of-age ritual in raptoran society, known as the Walk of the

Four Winds, is a test of self-reliance. Each young raptoran is

exiled from the ock and left to walk the earth alone until he

or she gains the strength and prowess required to y under

his or her own power up to the ocks cliff dwellings. Some

raptorans may wander the wilderness for months or years

before gaining the ability to y; others may travel to the cities

of humans and other races and never return to their homes

after learning ight. Even if they travel with others for a time,

all raptorans know that the Walk of the Four Winds is a test

of the selfwith ight as the reward.

Raptorans have a healthy curiosity about the world, but

this trait does not lead them to impulsive behavior, because

they  would  rather  debate  the  merits  of  a  new  situation

before  involving  themselves  in  it.  Thus,  raptorans  ock

to investigate anything new, but they keep a wary eye out

for danger and try to observe from a distance. Raptorans

examine newcomers and give them ample chance to prove

their intentions before deciding whether to trust them.

RAPTORAN ADVENTURERS ON THE WALK

Most low-level raptorans found away from their flocksincluding

almost all adventurerswill be undertaking the Walk of the Four

Winds, bound to walk the earth until they learn to fly.

The Walk of the Four Winds is a test all young raptorans must

eventually undergo to prove they can get by in the world alone

before rejoining the community. Still, the walk doesnt demand

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

solitude, and a raptoran wont spurn help from others during

the quest.

As a practical matter, most raptoran PCs will be on the Walk

of the Four Winds from 1st level (since they are eager to take ad-

vantage of the opportunity to begin the walk) through 4th level.

They can return to their flockeven if its only to visitany time

after attaining 5th level.

Some raptoran ocks tend herds of bison, deer, or elk near

their communities, taking some of the livestock each season

for food.

Religion: The goddess Tuilviel Glithien, the Queen of Air

and Night, is the raptorans primary deity. The raptorans call

her Lady of the Silent Wings or simply The Lady. Tuilviel

cherishes and protects all nocturnal birds. She is the patron

of the hunt and of the family.

Because many raptorans are druids, generalized nature wor-

ship is common among members of the race. Some raptorans,

especially arcane spellcasters, venerate powerful elementals

from the Elemental Plane of Air.

Language: Raptorans speak a uid and lyrical tongue they

call Tuilvilanuue. Ultimately derived from Elven but quite

distinct in its development, Tuilvilanuue has many long,

tongue-twisting words but simple grammar, relying on inec-

tion to convey much of its meaning. Written Tuilvilanuue

uses a simple form of the Elven script.

Most raptorans have a practical mind-set, so they conne

their writing to messages. Many raptoran songs, poems, and

histories exist, but the raptorans prefer memorizing these

to writing them down. Memories are lighter to carry than

books, a raptoran saying goes.

Names: A raptoran child receives a birth name from her

parents, which serves to identify the child as she grows up.

Sometime after the child reaches adolescence she acquires

a nicknameoccasionally from a ock elder but often a

sobriquet that just seems to stick. As a matter of practice,

only  members  of  a  raptorans  flock  may  refer  to  her  by

her  nickname,  and  even  then  they  only  do  so  when  no

strangers are present. Close friends and family members

often  continue  to  use  a  raptorans  birth  name  as  a  mark

of affection.

A raptoran may reveal her ock nickname to someone

outside the ock if she wishes, but no one else may do so.

Sharing ones ock nickname with an outsider is a mark of

deep respect, trust, or affection.

When a raptoran gains the ability to y under her own

power, she chooses an adult name for herself. In addition, a

raptoran has a family name, which is often a compound of

several descriptive Tuilvilanuue words.

For more on raptoran names, see page 82.

RAPTORAN RACIAL TRAITS

Raptoran base land speed is 30 feet.

Medium: As Medium creatures, raptorans have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Wing-Aided Movement: Raptorans can use their wings to

help with movement even if they cant y yet. The extra

lift from her wings gives a raptoran a +10 racial bonus on

Jump checks.

Gliding (Ex): A raptoran can use her wings to glide, negat-

ing damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of

forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Raptorans glide

at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability). Even if a

raptorans maneuverability improves, she cant hover while

gliding. A raptoran cant glide while carrying a medium

or heavy load.

If a raptoran becomes unconscious or helpless while

in midair, her wings naturally unfurl and powerful liga-

ments stiffen the wings. The raptoran descends in a tight

corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no

matter what the actual distance of the fall.

Flight (Ex): When a raptoran reaches 5 Hit Dice, she becomes

able to y at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability). A

raptoran cant y while carrying a medium or heavy load

or while fatigued or exhausted.

Raptorans  can  safely  fly  for  a  number  of  rounds

equal  to  their  Constitution  modifier  (minimum  1

round). They can exert themselves to fly for up to twice

as long, but then theyre fatigued at the end of the flight.

Raptorans are likewise fatigued after spending a total of

more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because raptorans

can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual

flight, they can remain aloft for extended periods (even

if they can only use flight for 1 round at a time without

becoming fatigued).

When they reach 10 Hit Dice, raptorans have enough

stamina and prowess to y for longer periods. They can y

at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), and ying

requires no more exertion than walking or running.

A raptoran with ight can make a dive attack. A dive

attack works like a charge, but the raptoran must move a

minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. A raptoran

can  make  a  dive  attack  only  when  wielding  a  piercing

weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage.

A raptoran with ight can use the run action while

ying, provided she ies in a straight line.

Pact with Wind Lords: Because of the ancient bargain

raptorans made with powerful air elementals, raptoran

Unerring Direction: Raptorans have an instinctive sense of

which direction is north, even when they are underground

or otherwise unable to see the sky or other visual cues.

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of  poor  illumination.  A  raptoran  retains  the  ability  to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Weapon  Familiarity:  Raptorans  treat  the  footbow  as  a

martial weapon rather than as an exotic weapon.

They stake out potential sites for new cliff dwellings for

months before deciding whether to build their spiraling

towers there.

Although raptorans do not share the halings tenden-

cy to play deliberate pranks, they do have an odd sense of

humorparticularly when it comes to nonflying crea-

tures.  Raptorans  do  not  deliberately  play  pranks

just to injure or embarrass others, but they often

find  wingless  ones  quite  funny.  Such  creatures

rarely think in three dimensions, and rap-

toran  hunters  can  follow  them  for  miles

before  they  catch  on.  Rap-

torans  have  witnessed

countless trysts in the

woods, accompanied

by  honeyed  words

pledging  eternal

devotion,  only

to hear the same

par ties  make

the  same  vows

to  others  only  a

few  weeks  later.

Raptorans  can

control their ex-

pressions well to

avoid  revealing

the mirth they feel

at the antics of oth-

er  races,  but  among

themselves they enjoy tell-

ing stories of how wingless

ones think and act.

A  raptoran  is  never  as  happy  as  when

she is in the air, even if shes only gliding.

She revels in the feel of the wind under her wings and the

limitless sky above, and the night sky is full of wonder for

her. She listens for the furtive rustle of creatures below

and  watches  the  clouds  race  across  the  sky,  alternately

blocking and revealing stars in an endlessly fascinating

pattern. She never tires of the subtle world of twilight and

dawnso different from the harsh light of the daytime

or the inky black of a moonless night. From high in the

sky, everything is softer, more muted, and more subtle.

Laughter sounds somehow more delicate, and songs more

haunting. The sky is a place of endless joy; in it, a raptoran

is truly at home.

Roleplaying Application: If youre playing a raptoran

character, take every opportunity you can nd to think in

three dimensions. Fly or glide rather than walk whenever

possible. Look before leaping and think before acting when

danger is not imminent. Always question the ways of others

to  see  whether  they  are  sound.  Consider  whether  your

character agrees with the sentiment of raptoran isolation,

or whether you would rather live with creatures of more

ambitious races.

RAPTORAN LIFE

Raptoran ocks are small, and their communities are by neces-

sity close-knit. Breeding and environment ensure that no two

ocks  are  alike,  but  raptoran  ocks  share  enough  common

characteristics to constitute a race-

spanning culture. Raptoran

PCs  can  embrace  that

culture, stand apart

from it, or question

it from within.

LEISURE

Because they live in small, self-

sufcient communities, raptorans

do not have a lot of leisure time.

They tend to spend the majority of

their waking hours hunting, gath-

ering, or remodeling the spiraling

cliff towers that house their com-

munity. Scouts and guardians are

responsible  for  the  safety  of  the

community, artisans make tools

and  nished  goods  for  the  rest

of the ock, and parents care for

their young. However, raptorans

do nd time for a variety of leisure

activities as well.

They  enjoy  an  aerial  team

sport  known  as  thinta,  which

involves  knocking  lightweight

balls  through  raised  hoops  and

catching  them  in  baskets.  The

rules  are  complex  and  the  game  fast-paced,

often taking less than thirty minutes to play.

Each player wields a clublike bat in one hand (to hit the ball,

hoping to propel it through the hoops) and a small, framed

net in the other hand (to intercept the ball or catch a pass

from a teammate). Touching the ball with ones hands during

the game is strictly forbidden.

Raptorans have a fascination with the stars, and many of

them enjoy studying their celestial movements. Few other

races have developed astronomy to as high a degree; the

raptorans know the positions and movements of the stars

as well as they know the lay of the land around their cliff

dwellingssometimes even better. Each star has a name in

their language, and many constellations also have names and

myths attached to them. Their night-sensitive eyes can see

the stars in more detail than those of humans, and the special

lenses they grind from the glass they create can magnify the

stars to reveal ne details and color.

Debate is also a popular pastime among raptorans. Their

habit of pondering and discussing any issues that come up

before  making  decisions  has  led  them  to  develop  a  nely

honed talent for genteel argument. Arguing is encouraged

among children, and they begin early to hone their talent

for  making  a  point  through  a  logical  process.  Raptorans

consider it bad form to enforce ones point through violence

(not that violence isnt appropriate for other reasons, but it

isnt a way to make a point). A typical raptoran feels that any

conclusion that cannot be made crystal-clear in debate is not

worth consideration.

Raptorans  hold  public  debates  on  any  desired  topics

whenever time permits. If the topic of the debate involves

requests from or activities of other races, raptorans appoint

one of their number to represent those parties in the debate.

Such representatives do their best to gain a full and complete

understanding of the topic at hand by both observing and

interviewing  members  of  the  target  race.  They  do  not,

however, usually tell those from whom they are gathering

information  the  exact

reason  why  they  are

doing so.

ARTS AND

CRAFTS

Raptorans  favorite  art

forms are those that in-

volve  wind  and  light.

Paintings are rare in rap-

toran culture, and those

that do exist use pigments

made  from  phosphores-

cent materials. Sculpture

is  common;  most  stat-

ues  are  small  gurines

carved from lightweight

wood  or  molded  from

kiln-red clay. Raptorans

also  have  a  unique  art

form  known  as  liessit,

which consists of shaped

and directed light. Rap-

torans  use  lenses  and

prisms to capture moon-

light and create dazzling

displays of colored light.

Such light shows usually

take place in the largest

rooms of the cliff dwell-

ing. By coaxing light into

the darkness of the earth,

raptorans feel that the art

of liessit has an inspiring, hopeful quality.

Music and storytelling are also popular activities among

raptorans. Because their culture cherishes oratorical skill,

raptorans memorize most of their songs and stories and relate

them over and over when the nights work is done. Raptorans

particularly enjoy moonsong, haunting melodies played on

pipes beneath the full moon.

Though raptorans do not mine metal and do not have as

much  use  for  blacksmiths  as  other  races  do,  they  do  have

metalworkers who specialize in mending broken weapons

and utensils and in forging small metal tools. Jewelers are

rare, but workers of crafts that produce lightweight and useful

items such as cloth, pots, leather, wood and bone carvings,

and baskets are common. Raptorans gather wood and convert

it into charcoal to re their forges and ovens.

Raptorans  have  developed  glassblowing  to  a  high

degree. They can sift sand and other silicates from the

soil and fire it to create molten glass that they blow into

a variety of shapes, both sturdy and delicate. Colors are

often added, and fantastic styles can be created with just

a twist of the wrist. Glass bowls, cups, drinking glasses,

and other everyday items can be made, repaired, or melted

down  and  reformed  in  the  raptorans  glass  furnaces.

Raptoran glassworkers

also make high-quality

lenses  for  fine  work

and  for  magnification

of distant objects.

The  ovens  and  fur-

naces  that  raptorans

use  for  their  glass-

blowing,  pottery,  and

weaponsmithing  are

usually  housed  in  pits,

caves, or stone structures

separate  from  their  liv-

ing quarters. Raptorans

often  connect  a  series

of  pipes  or  water  chan-

nels  to  rivers,  cisterns,  or

magic  water-producing

items  to  extinguish

accidental res.

Raptoran Architecture

Raptorans  are  particular-

ly  accomplished  at  magical

architecture.  Most  cliff

dwellings  are  the  product

of multiple wall of stone and

stone  shape  spells  cast  by

raptoran  spellcasters,  and

their  graceful  spirals  are

instantly  recognizable.  The

raptorans  mold  the  towers

into the cliffs with magic, of-

ten incorporating existing natural caves into their designs.

A few cliff dwellings have pathways for young raptorans

and land-bound visitors to reach the raptorans homes, but

most rely on rope ladders to assist those who cant y up to

meet the raptorans.

While raptoran cliff dwellings are defensible and aes-

thetically striking, they require a high-level spellcaster to

create. Raptoran flocks are accordingly loath to relocate

unless they have a powerful enough spellcaster to sculpt

or the inky black of a moonless night. From high in the

sky, everything is softer, more muted, and more subtle.

Laughter sounds somehow more delicate, and songs more

haunting. The sky is a place of endless joy; in it, a raptoran

is truly at home.

Roleplaying Application: If youre playing a raptoran

character, take every opportunity you can nd to think in

three dimensions. Fly or glide rather than walk whenever

possible. Look before leaping and think before acting when

danger is not imminent. Always question the ways of others

to  see  whether  they  are  sound.  Consider  whether  your

character agrees with the sentiment of raptoran isolation,

or whether you would rather live with creatures of more

ambitious races.

RAPTORAN LIFE

Raptoran ocks are small, and their communities are by neces-

sity close-knit. Breeding and environment ensure that no two

ocks  are  alike,  but  raptoran  ocks  share  enough  common

characteristics to constitute a race-

spanning culture. Raptoran

PCs  can  embrace  that

culture, stand apart

from it, or question

it from within.

LEISURE

Because they live in small, self-

sufcient communities, raptorans

do not have a lot of leisure time.

They tend to spend the majority of

their waking hours hunting, gath-

ering, or remodeling the spiraling

cliff towers that house their com-

munity. Scouts and guardians are

responsible  for  the  safety  of  the

community, artisans make tools

and  nished  goods  for  the  rest

of the ock, and parents care for

their young. However, raptorans

do nd time for a variety of leisure

activities as well.

They  enjoy  an  aerial  team

sport  known  as  thinta,  which

involves  knocking  lightweight

balls  through  raised  hoops  and

catching  them  in  baskets.  The

rules  are  complex  and  the  game  fast-paced,

often taking less than thirty minutes to play.

Each player wields a clublike bat in one hand (to hit the ball,

hoping to propel it through the hoops) and a small, framed

net in the other hand (to intercept the ball or catch a pass

from a teammate). Touching the ball with ones hands during

the game is strictly forbidden.

Raptorans have a fascination with the stars, and many of

them enjoy studying their celestial movements. Few other

races have developed astronomy to as high a degree; the

raptorans know the positions and movements of the stars

as well as they know the lay of the land around their cliff

dwellingssometimes even better. Each star has a name in

their language, and many constellations also have names and

myths attached to them. Their night-sensitive eyes can see

the stars in more detail than those of humans, and the special

lenses they grind from the glass they create can magnify the

stars to reveal ne details and color.

Debate is also a popular pastime among raptorans. Their

habit of pondering and discussing any issues that come up

before  making  decisions  has  led  them  to  develop  a  nely

honed talent for genteel argument. Arguing is encouraged

among children, and they begin early to hone their talent

for  making  a  point  through  a  logical  process.  Raptorans

consider it bad form to enforce ones point through violence

(not that violence isnt appropriate for other reasons, but it

isnt a way to make a point). A typical raptoran feels that any

conclusion that cannot be made crystal-clear in debate is not

worth consideration.

Raptorans  hold  public  debates  on  any  desired  topics

whenever time permits. If the topic of the debate involves

requests from or activities of other races, raptorans appoint

one of their number to represent those parties in the debate.

Such representatives do their best to gain a full and complete

understanding of the topic at hand by both observing and

interviewing  members  of  the  target  race.  They  do  not,

however, usually tell those from whom they are gathering

information  the  exact

reason  why  they  are

doing so.

ARTS AND

CRAFTS

Raptorans  favorite  art

forms are those that in-

volve  wind  and  light.

Paintings are rare in rap-

toran culture, and those

that do exist use pigments

made  from  phosphores-

cent materials. Sculpture

is  common;  most  stat-

ues  are  small  gurines

carved from lightweight

wood  or  molded  from

kiln-red clay. Raptorans

also  have  a  unique  art

form  known  as  liessit,

which consists of shaped

and directed light. Rap-

torans  use  lenses  and

prisms to capture moon-

light and create dazzling

displays of colored light.

Such light shows usually

take place in the largest

rooms of the cliff dwell-

ing. By coaxing light into

the darkness of the earth,

raptorans feel that the art

of liessit has an inspiring, hopeful quality.

Music and storytelling are also popular activities among

raptorans. Because their culture cherishes oratorical skill,

raptorans memorize most of their songs and stories and relate

them over and over when the nights work is done. Raptorans

particularly enjoy moonsong, haunting melodies played on

pipes beneath the full moon.

Though raptorans do not mine metal and do not have as

much  use  for  blacksmiths  as  other  races  do,  they  do  have

metalworkers who specialize in mending broken weapons

and utensils and in forging small metal tools. Jewelers are

rare, but workers of crafts that produce lightweight and useful

items such as cloth, pots, leather, wood and bone carvings,

and baskets are common. Raptorans gather wood and convert

it into charcoal to re their forges and ovens.

Raptorans  have  developed  glassblowing  to  a  high

degree. They can sift sand and other silicates from the

soil and fire it to create molten glass that they blow into

a variety of shapes, both sturdy and delicate. Colors are

often added, and fantastic styles can be created with just

a twist of the wrist. Glass bowls, cups, drinking glasses,

and other everyday items can be made, repaired, or melted

down  and  reformed  in  the  raptorans  glass  furnaces.

Raptoran glassworkers

also make high-quality

lenses  for  fine  work

and  for  magnification

of distant objects.

The  ovens  and  fur-

naces  that  raptorans

use  for  their  glass-

blowing,  pottery,  and

weaponsmithing  are

usually  housed  in  pits,

caves, or stone structures

separate  from  their  liv-

ing quarters. Raptorans

often  connect  a  series

of  pipes  or  water  chan-

nels  to  rivers,  cisterns,  or

magic  water-producing

items  to  extinguish

accidental res.

Raptoran Architecture

Raptorans  are  particular-

ly  accomplished  at  magical

architecture.  Most  cliff

dwellings  are  the  product

of multiple wall of stone and

stone  shape  spells  cast  by

raptoran  spellcasters,  and

their  graceful  spirals  are

instantly  recognizable.  The

raptorans  mold  the  towers

into the cliffs with magic, of-

ten incorporating existing natural caves into their designs.

A few cliff dwellings have pathways for young raptorans

and land-bound visitors to reach the raptorans homes, but

most rely on rope ladders to assist those who cant y up to

meet the raptorans.

While raptoran cliff dwellings are defensible and aes-

thetically striking, they require a high-level spellcaster to

create. Raptoran flocks are accordingly loath to relocate

unless they have a powerful enough spellcaster to sculpt

new cliff-towers. A few raptoran ocks forgo the towers and

live in a cliff with natural caves, but such ocks are ashamed

of their meager roosts.

Because a raptoran ock claims a wide area as its territory,

it usually establishes semipermanent campsites at several

locations beyond the cliff dwellings. Each campsite offers

a  good  vantage  point  to  look  for  game  and  spot  potential

intruders. Most are inaccessible to creatures that cant y.

Roleplaying Application: Raptorans enjoy storytelling,

but they enjoy a good argument more, and they often do

not understand when others take offense at their arguing.

However, they know when its time for debating and when

swift action is called for. Debating is a pleasure to them, not

a habit.

Raptoran characters often have ranks in Craft skills that

create light, portable items. Craft (glassblowing) is especially

common, and many raptorans who leave their ocks to make

their homes with other races set up glassblowing shops to

make their livings.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Compared with the technology of humans and dwarves,

raptoran technology seems much more narrowly focused. The

devices raptorans create can be quite sophisticated, but they

still appear rustic because raptorans utilize whatever natural

materials they have. Other than the spiral cliff-towers, most

raptoran creations are light and portable, so they lack the size

and grandeur of the works of other races.

Raptorans are masters of aerodynamics, and they under-

stand the ow, buoyancy, and movement of air better than

any other race. For example, the raptorans invented the

cargo kite (see Chapter 7), a device for the aerial transport of

goods and equipment. This item is a marvel of aerodynam-

ics that provides a means for raptorans to safely transport a

considerable load without exhausting themselves.

Raptorans  are  not  as  adept  with  arcane  magic  as  many

other races, and wizardry in particular holds little lure for

them because of the necessity of hauling around heavy books.

Sorcerers  and  bards  are  respected  for  their  innate  arcane

talents, which most consider a gift from the stars. For most

purposes, however, raptorans nd clerics and druids more

useful than arcane casters because they can heal and take

care of the ock. Rangers are appreciated for their ability to

combine much-needed divine magic with ghting ability.

RAPTORAN SOCIETY

AND CULTURE

Every  raptoran  ock  has  a  place  it  calls  homea  dwell-

ing that is either built into the side of a cliff or atop a tall

outcropping of rock. The key feature of such a location is

its inaccessibility: Creatures not capable of ying cannot

reach, much less enter, a raptoran cliff dwelling unless the

raptorans want them to.

A typical raptoran dwelling is in the form of either a spiral

tower (if the dwelling is built atop a cliff) or a rock-cut cave

complex (if the dwelling is within the cliff). In either case, it

will be divided into levels, each with its own T-shaped door

(to accommodate the raptorans wings) leading to the open

air and holes in the ceiling and oor that lead to neighbors

within the complex.

In  a  spiral  tower,  each  level  serves  as  the  site  for  a

nesta  single-family  dwelling  festooned  with  natural

materials  such  as  stretched  hides  for  bedding  and  light

wooden  panels  for  walls.  Glass  windows  permit  natural

moonlight to enter the dwelling, and cloth or leather shades

allow the residents to blot out the sunlight by day. Each

nest usually features a small kitchen, a living area, and one

or more bedrooms.

In a rock-cut cave complex, the nests tend to be deeper

inside the cliff wall, away from the open air. Instead of

windows, narrow shafts pierce the rock to let in moonlight

and fresh air. Rock-cut complexes tend to be more horizontal

than  vertical,  with  nesting  chambers  sometimes  side  by

side instead of atop each other. Ramps enable nonflying

raptorans to move from level to level. Narrow ramps built

into the cliff face may allow nonying characters to make

their way from the canyon oor to a location near the dwell-

ing, but rope ladders (which can be hauled up to secure the

complex) are always used for ascending at least the nal 60

feet of the distance.

Every flock maintains a place where revels and debates

are heldoften a natural  cave high in  the cliff,  but in

some  cases  a  separate  structure  constructed  near  the

main dwelling or cut into the cliffside. Ovens, forges, and

furnaces to repair weapons and make pots and glassware

are  usually  located  in  pits,  or  in  natural  caves  or  stone

structures at ground level. Crafting areas may be either in

cliff dwellings or on the ground, depending on the needs

and age of the artisan.

Raptorans spend much of their lives outside their cliff

homes, camping in the wilderness so they can hunt and

forage in the nearby terrain. During warm-weather seasons,

they take what they need from the land and the animals that

inhabit it. A typical raptoran camp is set up in a forested

area near the shore of a body of water. Many members of

the ock live here instead of in their cliff dwelling during

the spring and summer, harvesting and storing wild game

as well as berries, tubers, and other foodstuffs.

Raptorans  do  not  raise  domesticated  meat  animals,  but

they carefully manage the hunting of wild herds (often bison

or deer) near their dwellings. They do keep a variety of wild

and domesticated birds. Owls and giant owls are welcome

in a raptoran ock, often serving as sentries. Raptorans do

not raise dairy animals, and they consider eating eggs of any

kind unthinkable.

Typically, raptorans challenge any strangers who cross

into a ocks territory. If the intruders prove hostile, the

raptorans sound the alarm, bringing swift retribution from

the ocks warriors. If the intruders ask permission to hunt

on the ocks land, to pass through it on their way to another

place, or to rest there, the sentries bring the request to the

ock  for  debate,  sometimes  inviting  one  or  more  of  the

travelers to make their case in person. Such debates can

take considerable time, and the raptorans care not whether

they give their answer in a timely manner unless danger

to the ock is imminent. The raptorans eventually grant

permission to most travelers; its settlers that concern them,

not those who come and go.

Trusted visitors can expect more hospitable treatment;

they are often invited to dine with the ock or to watch

games or debates.

A YEAR AMONG THE RAPTORANS

While unpredictable events may disrupt it, life in a raptoran

ock tends to fall into a predictable pattern year after year.

Spring: In the early spring, the raptorans hold marriages,

rearrange living quarters to accommodate new couples, breed,

and lay eggs. During this time, when the eggs of their young

are being tended, the flock is especially vigilant against

marauding monsters and even innocent-seeming travelers

who approach their cliff dwelling.

The ock does little hunting around its camp in the spring

because both big game (antelope and deer) and small game

(rabbits and pheasants) are raising their own young during

this time. They do take sh from any nearby lake or river,

and are not averse to trading with nearby settlements of other

races for spring vegetables and our. During times when

fresh  food  is  scarce,  raptorans  supplement  their  diet  with

dried and smoked food stored from the previous year.

Encounter Hook: Because raptorans are extremely protec-

tive of their territory during this period, they ask player

characters to move along and refuse to provide any aid that

takes more than a few ock members from the area. They are,

however, quite interested in news of any possible threats to

their camp.

Summer: Once their eggs hatch in early summer, the

raptorans relax and are more welcoming to visitors. During

this season, they repair their metal weapons, make arrows,

replace broken glassware and pottery, and gather wood for

charcoal. Some artisans draw sand from a nearby lake shore

or river bank for use in glassmaking, while others clean and

repair the dwellings stoves and furnaces.

In the summer, the raptorans hunt for game, sh the lake

or river that lies near their camp, and gather fruits and berries

from the trees. They salt and dry their excess meat and sh,

digging storage pits in the ground and creating concealed

receptacles inside hollow trees to store their bounty.

Rinti parents teach their young to walk and talk during

the summer, and this is typically the time of year when young

adults of the ock depart on the Walk of the Four Winds.

Encounter Hook: Adventurers are more likely to encounter a

young raptoran just departed on her walk during the summer

than at any other time of year. Many of these questers know

as much of the outside world as outsiders know about the

raptorans (which is not much) and are happy to join adventur-

ing parties, at least for a time, to increase their experience

and hasten the day of their rst true ight.

Autumn: In the early autumn, raptorans do less hunting

and devote more energy to gathering fruits, nuts, and edible

wild grasses. They grind acorns into our and preserve any

other food they cannot use at the time. Hunters seek out

larger animals, culling the herds of big game in the area such

as bison, deer, and antelope.

Raptoran youngsters receive training in hunting, weapon

use, and community defense during the autumn. Adults tan

hides, weave cloth, and sew warm clothing in preparation

for winter.

Encounter Hook: Raptorans are busy during the fall, but

they are willing to deal for extra food with characters they

encounter. They ask for a share of any large animals the

PCs kill in exchange for pottery, ne glass, furs, or other

trade goods.

Winter: Food is scarce during the winter, and the ock

subsists mostly on small game hunting and the preserved

food theyve stored away all year. The ock rations food to

ensure that everyone survives until spring.

Because winter weather makes land travel harder and inclem-

ent weather sometimes forbids ying, raptorans stay in their

cliff dwellings almost exclusively during this season, making

and  repairing  needed  items  such  as  baskets,  pottery,  and

weapons. They also use time during the winter to create and

tell stories, hold debates, and practice with their weapons.

Encounter Hook: Raptorans usually have few visitors in the

winter, so the arrival of player characters is an unexpected

surprise. Though food is precious at this time, the raptorans

are so glad for a diversion in their day-to-day life that they

offer  meals  and  shelter  to  well-intentioned  travelers  in

exchange for stories and companionship.

RAPTORAN GOVERNMENT

Because raptorans have made a conscious decision to with-

draw from the affairs of other races and nations, they have

no countries to call their own and only a thin veneer of

overall leadership.

The high chieftain holds sway over a large region that

may contain up to one hundred or two hundred ocks. She

typically chooses a successor from within her own family,

and succession is not challenged unless the candidate can

be proven incompetent or evil.

The  high  chieftain  outlines  hunting  territory  for  all

raptorans she rules, reviews alliances, and settles disputes

between flocks. The high chieftain also commands the

stormtalons (see page 131), which are elite raptoran soldiers

sent to protect troubled ocks. A council of ock chiefs (see

below) meets a few times a year, providing advice to the high

chieftain and performing a number of culturally important

ceremonies and rituals.

Flock Structure

A typical raptoran ock consists of forty to eighty individuals.

Nuclear families nest together while the children are young,

and extended families usually occupy adjacent chambers in

a cliff dwelling.

stormtalons (see page 131), which are elite raptoran soldiers

sent to protect troubled ocks. A council of ock chiefs (see

below) meets a few times a year, providing advice to the high

chieftain and performing a number of culturally important

ceremonies and rituals.

Flock Structure

A typical raptoran ock consists of forty to eighty individuals.

Nuclear families nest together while the children are young,

and extended families usually occupy adjacent chambers in

a cliff dwelling.

The following ofces exist in a typical raptoran ock. All

except the ock chief usually serve for a year, but the ock

chief can reappoint a capable raptoran to an ofce any number

of times. A single raptoran may hold an ofce multiple times

in his or her life.

Flock Chief: One older raptoran rules each ock as its

chief. This raptoran is technically considered of royal blood

regardless of the individuals actual relationship to the high

chieftain. Since ock chiefs typically marry within the ock,

their offspring often inherit leadership of the ock upon the

parents death. As with the high chieftain, a ock chief usu-

ally chooses her own successor from within her bloodline.

A  new  ock  with  no  members  able  to  trace  their  lineage

back to the royal family must petition the high chieftain for

a leader; this practice ensures that the royal bloodline is well

distributed throughout the region.

It is the ock chief who decrees when each young raptoran

is ready to undergo the Walk of the Four Winds; such deci-

sions are rendered after the chief consults with a youngsters

family and other members of the ock.

Sunspeaker: This ofcial goes out in the daylightactive

when the rest of her people are sleeping through the heat

of the dayto meet with representatives from the outside

world, most of whom are active in the daylight hours. She

represents her people in major negotiations as well as minor

matters  of  hunting  rights.  Quite  often,  when  adventurers

enter raptoran territory, the rst member of the race they

encounter is the ocks sunspeaker.

War Chief: This raptoran manages any conict the tribe

may have, from a debate with another ock to an armed battle

with other races. The war chief is responsible for ensuring

that the ock has enough footbows, arrows, and foot spikes

stockpiled  to  arm  every  adult  raptoran.  He  also  plans  the

battle strategy and directs operations on the battleeld as

needed. In times of peace, the war chief trains young rap-

torans in weapon use and drills adults in close aerial combat

maneuvers.

Medicine Chief: Usually the highest-ranking cleric or

druid in the ock, the medicine chief coordinates medical

care for the community, making heavy use of divine magic

as well as herbal and conventional healing methods. She sets

broken bones, tends wounds, and makes herbal ointments and

draughts with healing properties. The medicine chief also

coordinates the response to any disease that may break out

within the tribe and creates food to supplement the tribes

supplies during times of famine.

Hunting  Chief:  This  ofcial  chooses  and  deploys

hunting  parties  and  charts  the  movements  of  game.  He

assigns each party an amount of game to bring back, and

the  group  must  not  return  with  less  than  their  quota,

unless a serious injury occurs or they encounter a threat to

the community.

Supply Chief: This raptoran is in charge of the ocks

food and water supplies as well as raw materials for building,

crafts, and medicines. Because water supplies are critical, a

supply chief can assign teams to dig cisterns, string water

pipes, and otherwise create systems to divert and store water

for the ock.

Star Chief: The star chief of a ock charts the move-

ment of the stars, navigates by the stars during long travels,

and maps out constellations. She also coordinates ockwide

events that take place under the stars.

LOVE

Raptorans are deeply devoted to their families and their age-

mates. While growing up, raptorans spend most of their time

with their age-mates, whether in training, at their chores,

and at leisure. At dawn, they return to their family nests to

eat supper and to sleep.

Raptorans are egg-layersa fact that helps to explain many

of their odd customs. However, they suckle their young like

mammals rather than rearing them in the avian way.

In the rst spring season after a raptoran reaches matu-

rity (about age 20), he or she may take a mate. Marriages

last for one season onlyjust long enough for the couple

to hatch a clutch of eggs and raise the young to edgling

stage. The following spring, a raptoran may take a different

mate or renew the marriage to the same one, if both parties

desire it.

Typically, age-mates all take their mates at the same time,

and many hold group weddings to celebrate the occasion.

Age-mates typically marry age-mates of the opposite gender,

and the groups may be from the same ock or from differ-

ent ones. In interock marriages, the entire wedded group

typically chooses one ock to stay with for the year, though

fracturing of age-mate groups does occasionally occur. Once

in a while when a parent ock is becoming too large, the

wedded group simply splits off to form a new ock.

Reproduction

Raptorans of both genders have cyclical periods of fertility.

Typically, each individual is fertile for one year out of every

three until the age of 150, when fertility ends. No raptoran

knows when he or she will be fertile, so couplings that do

not result in offspring are common.

If a couple is fertile, the female lays three or four eggs in the

spring, and the eggs hatch in early summer. Both parents tend

the eggs until hatching. When the ock is tending to eggs,

it defends its territory more aggressively than it otherwise

would, especially against anyone traveling directly toward

their camp or their cliff dwelling.

Newborn raptorans have wing spikes that they use to break

through the shells of their eggs, but these fall off soon after

birth. Once the young have hatched, they are carried in har-

nesses by their parents until they can walk on their own.

The young grow a full set of feathers by the fall season in

the year of their birth. Most learn to walk within a year and

glide by their second year.

RAPTORANS AT WAR

ritorialespecially during spring, when a ock is tending to

its eggs. At such times, they tolerate no threat to their lands

and drive off intruders with particular ferocity.

Raptorans  rarely  ght  with  each  other,  though  ocks

compete for territory at times. Raptoran custom forbids such

disputes during nesting season, but they may occur at any

other time.

A  territorial  dispute  between  raptoran  ocks  typically

takes the form of a debate, with each side presenting its case

for taking over the disputed land. Such debates can rage for

days at a time. If the two ocks cannot come to agreement, a

representative from the high chieftain may come

to settle the dispute, which by then is called

a  war,  despite  the  lack  of

physical violence. If the

chieftain  is  unavail-

able, trusted allies of

other  races  may  be

called in to hear the

complaints. Flocks in

particularly  remote

areas  may  have  no

one  to  mediate  their

disputes.

If  there  is  no  clear

winner  of  a  war  and

mediation doesnt work,

the  two  ocks  stage  a

mock  battle  using  curved

sticks as weapons rather

than arrows and spikes.

Whichever  ock  ees

the eld or has all its adult

members  knocked  uncon-

scious is the loser.

Raptorans rarely lend their

support to the wars of other races.

Even when something threatens

raptoran lands, it takes a skilled

orator  to  rouse  the  raptorans  to

involve  themselves  in  the  affairs  of  the

larger world. When they do ght alongside other races, rap-

torans typically provide air support and plan their strategy

in conjunction with those they are aiding so as to take full

advantage of their special talents.

In battle, raptorans prefer the footbow and foot spikes as

weapons.  They  also  make  extensive  use  of  nets,  dropping

them upon groups of enemies to restrict the foes mobility

while maximizing their own. Raptorans take full advantage of

their ying or gliding ability and always take a three-dimen-

sional perspective for their ghts. They seek the high ground

because its a good launching point for younger raptorans

who only can glide, and because an uphill slope slows down

land-bound enemies. More experienced raptorans can stay

aloft indenitely, so they often circle a battleeld and rain

arrows down on their foes.

Roleplaying Application: Raptorans can add new spice

to combat with their ability to fight in a three-dimensional

environment. Consider taking proficiency with the net in

order to maximize your raptorans battle efficiency.

DEATH

Veneration of elders is a key feature of the raptoran mind-

set. Thus, the ock still cherishes those raptorans who are

disabled  or  too  old  to  pull  their  own  weight.  A  raptoran

who can no longer contribute to  the ock because of ad-

vanced age is accorded a great deal of respect, and

young  raptorans  are  often  eager  to  hear  tales

from their elders childhoods. Raptorans

understand  that  the  world  is  harsh,

and  that  they  cannot  afford  to  eject

ock membersespecially the

wisest membersbecause

theyre  no  longer  physi-

cally capable.

A  raptoran  flock

honors  its  dead  with

a vigil, usually for an

individual  but  occa-

sionally  for  a  whole

group  if  several  died

at  once.  Then  the  rap-

torans  take  the  corpse

and  lift  it  to  the

winds, placing it on

a  high  ledge  or  peak

where the raptorans believe

the  air  elementals  will  lift

the body up and make it part of

the wind itself. Elderly raptorans

take great pride in choosing a fa-

vorite peak or high place to be lifted

from. Those who die unexpectedly in

an accident or a battle are taken to a place

of the ock chiefs choosing.

LAWS AND JUSTICE

The  high  chieftain  hands  down  the  laws  that  apply  to  all

raptorans, but each ock chief is free to impose additional

laws that do not conict with the basic ones. The self-reliant

raptoran attitude extends to law enforcement, so a raptoran is

likely to seek justice from a known wrongdoer himself rather

than rely on the community to do it for him. The ock as a

whole deals with lawbreakers only when a member of the

ock registers a complaint with the ock chief, or when the

wrongdoers identity is unknown. Since raptoran ocks are

small enough for everyone to know everyone elses business,

the community generally knows when someone breaks a law,

but the rest of the ock will give the wronged party a chance

to settle the matter before getting involved.

If the two parties cant work out their dispute, or if the

reprisals  and  counterreprisals  spin  out  of  control  and

Newborn raptorans come out of their shells

a few weeks time, while others walk for months or even

years  before  mastering  a  wing-powered  ascent.  Roughly

one-quarter of raptorans never return from the Walk of the

Four Winds, either because they succumb to the dangers

of the wider world or they  nd new companions and a new

home during their walk.

RELIGION

Most raptorans consider religion a part of their personal

lives, and they treat the moon and other heavenly bodies

with great reverence. They take a moment to offer a prayer of

thanksgiving at dusk for each new night, and for a night well

spent every dawn. They also pray for good weather, adequate

food and water, successful hunts, and fertility.

NATURE WORSHIP

The raptoran religion is primarily nature-based, and each of

its deities has some connection to the natural world. Rap-

torans also revere the spirits of trees, brooks, and streams.

Raptorans are taught to respect their quarry in the hunt and

to thank the spirit of each animal they slay for giving up its

life to support them.

Clerics and druids share the responsibility for spiritual

guidance of the  ock, and they cooperate as much as possible

to ensure the well-being of its people. Clerics handle most

of the actual rituals, while druids bless the hunt and explain

the ways of the animals to the hunters.

endanger others well-being, the  ock takes action. The  ock

chief (or another  ock chief, if the chief is the defendant)

hears the case and dispenses justice. A raptoran  ock usu-

ally has a strong opinion on whether someone is innocent

or guilty, and the chief usually renders a decision based on

the testimony of other raptorans.

Punishment often takes the form of some kind of com-

munity service, typically a quest on behalf of the  ock. The

convicted raptoran is told not to come back until the service

has been performed to speci cations. The dif culty of the

quest varies with the severity of the crime, and sometimes

restrictions  of  one  kind  or  another  are  placed  upon  the

miscreanttypically a prohibition against wearing armor or

using a particular type of weapon in the performance of the

task. The raptoran may choose not to undertake the quest, but

doing so amounts to self-exile because she can never return

to her  ock.

Roleplaying  Application:  A  raptoran  PC  might  be

recently departed from her  ock on some sort of community

service  mission,  which  can  serve  as  an  adventure  hook.

Thereafter, she may decide that she enjoys the adventuring

life and put off returning even after she has completed the

task set for her.

EXILES

While a few raptorans suffer exile as a punishment for their

crimes, all raptorans undergo a temporary exilethe Walk

of the Four Windsat some point during their young adult

years.  After  a  feast  and  an  elaborate  ceremony,

a  young  raptoran  takes  one   nal  glide  out

of  the   ocks  cliff  dwelling  and  is

expected to survive alone for months

or years, perhaps traveling far beyond

the  ocks lands.

A  young  raptoran  can  return  from  her

Walk of the Four Winds only when she can

 y back up to the cliff dwelling under her own

powerno ladders, ropes, or magic allowed. Some

raptorans develop the strength and technique in

Holy symbol of

Tuilvel Glithien

THE RAPTORAN PANTHEON

The typical raptoran chooses one deity from the pan-

theon to venerate but also pays homage

to all the rest. Any cleric or druid may

lead prayers to any of the gods, and all

prayers  include  an  acknowledgement

of Tuilviel Glithien.

Tuilviel Glithien

Greater God (Chaotic Good)

Tuilviel  Glithien  is  also  called  the

Queen of Air and Night and the Lady

of the Silent Wings. She cherishes and

protects all nocturnal birds. As patron

of  the  hunt  and  of  the  family,  she  has

jurisdiction over a signi cant portion of the

raptorans daily life. The legendary creator

of  the  raptorans,  she  serves  as  both  their

guardian and their guide.

The Lady of the Silent Wings appears as a

beautiful female raptoran of indeterminate age,

with snowy-white feathers crowning her head.

Her skin is white and glows like moonlight, and she

wears a black gown sprinkled with diamonds like

a sky full of tiny stars. Her enormous white wings

are banded with every shade of the setting sunin

fact, the raptorans often refer to dusk as the Lady spreading

her wings.

Portfolio: Raptorans, night birds, stars, moon.

Domains: Air, Chaos, Good, Protection, Sky.

New domain described on page 174.

Cleric Training: Clerics of Tuilviel begin their

careers by taking nightly solo journeys

around  the  raptorans  canyon  homes

to scout the area for intruders. Later in

their  careers  they  lead  extended  hunting

expeditions, chart the stars, and interpret

various astronomical phenomena, such

as falling stars.

Quests: Followers of Tuilviel typically

undertake quests to capture specimens

of unusual nocturnal animals, retrieve

items that enhance  ight or night vision,

or  undertake  overland   ights  to  make

astronomical observations from hard-to-

reach peaks.

Prayers: Prayers to the Queen of Air and

Night ask for good hunting, good weather,

or almost any kind of personal aid. They are

always couched in terms of  ight. A common

prayer begins Grant us a straight  ight and a safe

perch for the day. . . .

Shrines:  The  Ladys  shrines  are  built  into

natural hollows in the cliffs, high enough to allow

worshipers to observe moonrise and moonset. The

surrounding stone is usually artfully carved to frame such

celestial events. Her shrines double as temporary shelters for

one or two raptorans.

Rites:  Clerics  of  Tuilviel  perform

rites that bless new and old cliff dwellings,

preside at seasonal weddings, and conduct

vigils for dead or dying raptorans. They

also hold an annual festival known as

the Flight of the Lady, in which all the

raptorans capable of  ight soar as high as

they can into the sky at midnight, then

spread their wings and glide gently to

earth. Wherever a raptoran lands, she

plants  one  of  her  own  feathers  in  the

dirt as a marker.

Herald  and  Allies:  A  raptoran

10th-level ranger/10th-level druid serves

as  Tuilviels  herald  on  the  Material  Plane.

Her allies include Medium, Large, and Huge

air elementals.

Favored Weapon: Foot spikes.

Duthila

Lesser Goddess (Neutral)

The  Lady  of  Abundance  appears  as  a  brown-

skinned raptoran with  ame-red feathers. Dressed

in long-sleeved tunic and trousers of a golden hue,

she holds sway over the autumn harvest season, during which

food is abundant but the trees lose their leaves.

Maturity  and  travel  are  within  her  purview,  because

raptorans hatched the previous spring often take their  rst

steps in autumn. Duthila also concerns herself

with the preservation and storage of excess

Cleric  Training:  Clerics  of

Duthila  manage  the  preservation  of

excess food. They  lter rainwater for

long-term storage in the cisterns of a

cliff dwelling and sun-dry vegetables

and fruits. They dig pits and hollow out

dead trees in and around the raptorans

camp to hold caches of food. Later in their

careers, they lead hunting expeditions for

meat during the winter.

Quests: Followers of Duthila undertake

quests  to  ensure  food  supplies  and  go  on

a few weeks time, while others walk for months or even

years  before  mastering  a  wing-powered  ascent.  Roughly

one-quarter of raptorans never return from the Walk of the

Four Winds, either because they succumb to the dangers

of the wider world or they  nd new companions and a new

home during their walk.

RELIGION

Most raptorans consider religion a part of their personal

lives, and they treat the moon and other heavenly bodies

with great reverence. They take a moment to offer a prayer of

thanksgiving at dusk for each new night, and for a night well

spent every dawn. They also pray for good weather, adequate

food and water, successful hunts, and fertility.

NATURE WORSHIP

The raptoran religion is primarily nature-based, and each of

its deities has some connection to the natural world. Rap-

torans also revere the spirits of trees, brooks, and streams.

Raptorans are taught to respect their quarry in the hunt and

to thank the spirit of each animal they slay for giving up its

life to support them.

Clerics and druids share the responsibility for spiritual

guidance of the  ock, and they cooperate as much as possible

to ensure the well-being of its people. Clerics handle most

of the actual rituals, while druids bless the hunt and explain

the ways of the animals to the hunters.

endanger others well-being, the  ock takes action. The  ock

chief (or another  ock chief, if the chief is the defendant)

hears the case and dispenses justice. A raptoran  ock usu-

ally has a strong opinion on whether someone is innocent

or guilty, and the chief usually renders a decision based on

the testimony of other raptorans.

Punishment often takes the form of some kind of com-

munity service, typically a quest on behalf of the  ock. The

convicted raptoran is told not to come back until the service

has been performed to speci cations. The dif culty of the

quest varies with the severity of the crime, and sometimes

restrictions  of  one  kind  or  another  are  placed  upon  the

miscreanttypically a prohibition against wearing armor or

using a particular type of weapon in the performance of the

task. The raptoran may choose not to undertake the quest, but

doing so amounts to self-exile because she can never return

to her  ock.

Roleplaying  Application:  A  raptoran  PC  might  be

recently departed from her  ock on some sort of community

service  mission,  which  can  serve  as  an  adventure  hook.

Thereafter, she may decide that she enjoys the adventuring

life and put off returning even after she has completed the

task set for her.

EXILES

While a few raptorans suffer exile as a punishment for their

crimes, all raptorans undergo a temporary exilethe Walk

of the Four Windsat some point during their young adult

years.  After  a  feast  and  an  elaborate  ceremony,

a  young  raptoran  takes  one   nal  glide  out

of  the   ocks  cliff  dwelling  and  is

expected to survive alone for months

or years, perhaps traveling far beyond

the  ocks lands.

A  young  raptoran  can  return  from  her

Walk of the Four Winds only when she can

 y back up to the cliff dwelling under her own

powerno ladders, ropes, or magic allowed. Some

raptorans develop the strength and technique in

Tuilvel Glithien

THE RAPTORAN PANTHEON

The typical raptoran chooses one deity from the pan-

theon to venerate but also pays homage

to all the rest. Any cleric or druid may

lead prayers to any of the gods, and all

prayers  include  an  acknowledgement

of Tuilviel Glithien.

Tuilviel Glithien

Greater God (Chaotic Good)

Tuilviel  Glithien  is  also  called  the

Queen of Air and Night and the Lady

of the Silent Wings. She cherishes and

protects all nocturnal birds. As patron

of  the  hunt  and  of  the  family,  she  has

jurisdiction over a signi cant portion of the

raptorans daily life. The legendary creator

of  the  raptorans,  she  serves  as  both  their

guardian and their guide.

The Lady of the Silent Wings appears as a

beautiful female raptoran of indeterminate age,

with snowy-white feathers crowning her head.

Her skin is white and glows like moonlight, and she

wears a black gown sprinkled with diamonds like

a sky full of tiny stars. Her enormous white wings

are banded with every shade of the setting sunin

fact, the raptorans often refer to dusk as the Lady spreading

her wings.

Portfolio: Raptorans, night birds, stars, moon.

Domains: Air, Chaos, Good, Protection, Sky.

New domain described on page 174.

Cleric Training: Clerics of Tuilviel begin their

careers by taking nightly solo journeys

around  the  raptorans  canyon  homes

to scout the area for intruders. Later in

their  careers  they  lead  extended  hunting

expeditions, chart the stars, and interpret

various astronomical phenomena, such

as falling stars.

Quests: Followers of Tuilviel typically

undertake quests to capture specimens

of unusual nocturnal animals, retrieve

items that enhance  ight or night vision,

or  undertake  overland   ights  to  make

astronomical observations from hard-to-

reach peaks.

Prayers: Prayers to the Queen of Air and

Night ask for good hunting, good weather,

or almost any kind of personal aid. They are

always couched in terms of  ight. A common

prayer begins Grant us a straight  ight and a safe

perch for the day. . . .

Shrines:  The  Ladys  shrines  are  built  into

natural hollows in the cliffs, high enough to allow

worshipers to observe moonrise and moonset. The

surrounding stone is usually artfully carved to frame such

celestial events. Her shrines double as temporary shelters for

one or two raptorans.

Rites:  Clerics  of  Tuilviel  perform

rites that bless new and old cliff dwellings,

preside at seasonal weddings, and conduct

vigils for dead or dying raptorans. They

also hold an annual festival known as

the Flight of the Lady, in which all the

raptorans capable of  ight soar as high as

they can into the sky at midnight, then

spread their wings and glide gently to

earth. Wherever a raptoran lands, she

plants  one  of  her  own  feathers  in  the

dirt as a marker.

Herald  and  Allies:  A  raptoran

10th-level ranger/10th-level druid serves

as  Tuilviels  herald  on  the  Material  Plane.

Her allies include Medium, Large, and Huge

air elementals.

Favored Weapon: Foot spikes.

Duthila

Lesser Goddess (Neutral)

The  Lady  of  Abundance  appears  as  a  brown-

skinned raptoran with  ame-red feathers. Dressed

in long-sleeved tunic and trousers of a golden hue,

she holds sway over the autumn harvest season, during which

food is abundant but the trees lose their leaves.

Maturity  and  travel  are  within  her  purview,  because

raptorans hatched the previous spring often take their  rst

steps in autumn. Duthila also concerns herself

with the preservation and storage of excess

Lesser God (Neutral)

The Father of Snows is the raptoran god of winter, sleep,

and death. He blankets the world with snow under which

young  trees  and  plants  slumber  peacefully  until  the  next

spring. He also holds sway over those about to die, including

the aged and inrm. Kithin ies down to pick up the souls

of particularly wise raptorans and take them to their

just rewards.

months. Later, they tend the communal

res that keep the camp warm and tally the

supplies needed for the winter season.

Quests: Followers of Kithin battle undead, seek

out magical re sources and other protections against

cold to get through the winter, and journey to rescue

souls lost to denizens of the Lower Planes.

Prayers: Prayers to the Father of Snows are silent,

communicated entirely by thought. Some raptorans

claim that answers to prayers for guidance come in the form

of unusually vivid dreams. References to cold are common,

and many raptorans ask Kithin to keep the cold at bay for

loved ones who have passed on.

Shrines: Kithins shrines, not present throughout most

of the year, are made anew from ice or

snow bricks each winter.

Rites:  Kithins  clerics  conduct

funerals, bless winter supplies, and keep

the res burning constantly at the winter

camps. They preside over an annual ritual

called the Snowbinding, in which raptorans

allow the snow to cover them almost completely

and sleep for a night beneath it.

Herald and Allies: Kithins herald is a

20th-level ghost raptoran barbarian. His

allies are Medium, Large, and Huge re

elementals.

Favored Weapon: Spear.

Lliendil

Intermediate God (Chaotic Neutral)

Known as the Lord of the Clouds or the

Stormfather, Lliendil holds sway over weather

of all kinds, from fair skies to violent storms. A

capricious god, he can be gentle and kind or angry

and destructive, depending upon his mood. He is a

somewhat cruel prankster who enjoys altering the

weather suddenly to cause discomfort, destroy new struc-

tures,  and  ruin  plans.  Whether  or  not  his  capriciousness

extends to malice, the Lord of the Clouds is as unpredictable

as the weather itself.

Lliendil  appears  as  an  adult  male  raptoran  with  blue-

black  skin,  eyes  crackling  with  electricity,

and  electric-blue  feathers.  His  wings  are

banded with white, and he usually wears black

breeches and a leather jerkin without a shirt.

Prayers: Prayers to the Stormfather usually involve an

element of fawning and begging. Common beginnings

include  Please,  oh  please,  Stormfather,  grant  us  fair

skies for our journey! and Let the storms come only

after we are safe so that we may praise your name in our

new campsite.

Shrines: Lliendils shrinesusually wooden lean-tosare

always placed in the tops of exposed ridges and high cliff

faces, where they would be the rst structures destroyed by

foul weather. Such placement is done in the hope that near-

ness to the sky will make ones prayers more audible to the

god, and that he will not destroy his own shrines by creating

foul weather on a whim.

Rites:  Lliendils  clerics  perform  rituals  designed  to

propitiate their capricious god and to ask for good weather

for  journeys  and  special  events.  They  also  perform  an

annual ritual called the Stormcall in early spring. This

rite begs the god for a fierce storm to pound the

area  and  test  the  worthiness  of  the  flock.  Not

only does the resulting storm identify weakened

platforms and cleanse the area, but the raptorans also

hope that it gets the desire for a bad storm out of the

gods system.

Herald and Allies: Lliendils herald is a storm

giant. His allies include Medium, Large, and

Huge air elementals and water elementals.

Favored Weapon: Heavy ail.

the  night  skies  are  warm  and

balmy, the young are maturing, and

food plants begin to produce their

bounty.  Hunting  is  plentiful,  and

Nilthina presides over the meat harvest.

Summer is also the time when raptorans

relate stories of their race to the young

and write songs.

Nilthina  appears  as  a  handsome,  bare-

chested male raptoran dressed in breeches. His

skin is bronzed and his feathers the purest gold.

Occasionally Nilthina is said to appear in the night

sky,  tossing  stars  back  and  forth  while  his  song

Portfolio: Summer, abundance, warmth, growth, lore.

Domains: Air, Animal, Plant, Sun.

Cleric Training: Many of Nilthinas clerics begin their

training by leading hunting expeditions and by salting and

drying meat and sh. Later in their careers, they teach weapon

use and advanced ight techniques to other raptorans.

Quests: Followers of Nilthina undertake quests to rid

nearby lands of any local monsters, to end famines and

plagues, and to seek alliances with friendly creatures. Quests

that involve music and musical instruments are also common

for Nilthinas faithful.

spoken when facing the sun and always mention abundance

in some way, whether the person offering the prayer is asking

for it or expressing thanks for it. Please grant us the bounty

of nature is the start of one common prayer.

Shrines: Nilthinas shrines are often vine-covered caves

built low on the cliff that a particular ock claims.

Rites: Clerics of Nilthina hold ceremonies to bless hunters

and gatherers as well as new alliances. They also hold a sun

ceremony each year during the summer solstice in which

they celebrate the accomplishments of another year.

teach  young  raptorans  how  to  sh  in  the  streams

and gather food. When initiates are accepted into the

priesthood, they plant trees near the cliff dwelling

to  celebrate.  Later,  the  new  members  of  the  clergy

RAPTORAN HISTORY

AND FOLKLORE

Every raptoran has heard just about all the legends of the

race,  but  few  strangers  ever  witness  such  tales.  Raptorans

are  willing  to  tell  these  tales  to  nonraptoran  friends  they

have come to trust, but they otherwise keep them within

their  ocks.

Two  of  the  most  often  told  raptorian  legends  are

summarized below.

MYTHIC ORIGINS:

TUILVIEL AND THE BOAR

In  the  days  when  the  mortal  races  were  young,  Tuilviel

Glithien kept to herself, rarely spending any time with the

other gods and gliding through the night skies alone. Her

solitary nature drew the attention of Lolth, who claimed the

night and resented Tuilviels in uence over it. Lolth decided

to trap the winged huntress and slay her.

After turning herself into a fearsome boar, Lolth let Tuilviel

spot her from above and then began to run. The Queen of Air

and Night had never before encountered a boar that could

run so fast or so far. On and on she  ew in pursuit of the

beast, striving to plunge her foot spikes into its  esh at every

opportunity. Still the boar ran, diving into the underbrush

when Tuilviel  ew low and emerging again at a dead run. The

boars hooves tore deep ruts into the earth as it ran, keeping

ahead of its winged pursuer.

At last, the boar ran into a canyon whose mouth was over-

grown with brambles. Thinking she had the boar cornered,

Tuilviel dove into the canyon, only to  nd that it had no exit

and the brambles held her fast.

Still in boar form, Lolth attacked Tuilviel. Realizing that

she was outmatched on the ground, the Queen of Air and

Night ripped herself free of the brambles and took to the

sky. From above, she tore at the remaining brambles, peeling

away the boars defensive shield. Finally, she seized the boar

and  ew away with him. The boar struggled mightily, but

Tuilviel held fast. Droplets of blood from the many wounds

she had already sustained rained down to the earth, forming

the  rst raptorans where they struck.

On and on she  ew, and  nally she reached a great crevasse

that led directly to the realms below the earth. After dropping

the boar into this pit, Tuilviel settled onto a nearby tree to rest.

The night was hers, and never again would Lolth succeed in

reclaiming it. Ever since that day, the raptorans have shared

a hatred of Lolth with all elves who are not drow.

THE RAPTORAN WHO

DEBATED WITH HIMSELF

Long ago, a band of orcs sought to make war on an encamp-

ment of humans who intended to found a town on the edge

of the wilderness. The aggressors scouted the area, then

camped in a hidden canyon to discuss their plans. In a short

time, several raptoran sentries challenged them. The orcs,

not realizing that simply asking permission to camp would

probably have enabled them to stay without incident, attacked

the winged creatures immediately.

Fiercely the raptorans fought, and their footbows downed

several of the enemy. In the end, however, the orcs prevailed,

slaying all except one raptoran. They captured the survivor,

who was named Yuilith.

You, said the orc leader, will fly to the humans and

tell them that the orc tribe is peaceful and intends to send

representatives at dawn tomorrow to offer an alliance.

Do  not  think  to  do  otherwise,  warned  another  orc,

because I will follow you and shoot you from the sky if you

try to  y away or if you say anything else to the humans.

The orcs let Yuilith go and sent their  nest archer out to

keep track of him.

Hah! Good plan! Sneaky plan! said the other orcs after

the raptoran had left. We really attack at dusk, before theyre

ready! Theyll never expect us!

As Yuilith  ew toward the humans settlement, careful not

to get too far away from the orc archer that followed him on

the ground, he wrestled within himself about what to do.

If he told the humans what the orcs wanted him to say, he

might survive to return to his  ock and share the tale of this

great adventureyet at the same time he realized that the

orcs were almost certainly not telling the truth.

I wish I could return to the flock and put this matter up for

debate, Yuilith thought. I may not be qualified to make this

decision myself.

On the other hand, Yuilith realized, his raptoran upbring-

ing was supposed to have made him self-reliant. He had

learned how to fend for himself in perilous situations  while

he was on the Walk of the Four Winds, and perhaps he could

also rely on his good judgment to make the right decision in

this crisis.

Yuilith went back and forth in his mind between saying

what the orcs wanted and warning the humans to beware of

these savagesbetween possibly escaping with his life and

probably being skewered by an arrow if he disobeyed the

orcs instructions. Finally he neared the humans camp, and

decision time was upon him.

Landing on a tree branch at the outskirts of the encampment,

he called to the humans. Good day! he cried.

Welcome, friend, said a human sentry. Are you hungry?

Would you like to share our food?

No,  replied  Yuilith.  I  am  here  merely  to  tell  you

something, he continued.

Well, what is it? asked the human.

Guard your camporcs are on the march, croaked out

Yuilith.  As he spoke the words, Yuilith knew he had done the

right thing. The  ock would have agreed with me, he thought.

The humans must be warned.

In the next instant, the orc archer killed Yuilith with

a single arrow, but the humans had received the message

loud and clear. They made short work of the orc archer and

then set about preparing for an attack. Hours later, the orcs

descended upon what they thought would be a bunch of

helpless humans and were met with stout hearts and sharp

steel. The humans quickly prevailed, slaying their opponents

down to the last one.

Amid the carnage and wreckage of the battle eld, no one

noticed the slight, feathered form of Yuilith lying in the dust.

A thunderstorm raged overhead that night, so no one saw the

black-skinned raptoran who appeared at midnight, cradling

Yuilith to his breast. The deity Lliendil buried Yuilith in a

cairn  on  the  plane  of  Arborea,  honoring  him  for  all  time

because he had the wisdom to debate within himself and

the courage to make the right decision.

LANGUAGE

Tuilvilanuue, the language of the raptorans, uses the

Elven alphabet, but its grammar is much sim-

pler than Elven. In ection conveys much of

Tuilvilanuues meaning. Thus, basic verbal

communication  between  two  raptorans  is

ef cient and clear, but the rich subtleties of

intonation are dif cult for others to grasp.

Because  intonation  isnt  clear  in  written

Tuilvilanuue, raptoran authors must explain

the nuances in separate sentences. Written

epics in Tuilvilanuue tend to be very long as

a result, and readers often  nd that the text

explains  everything  three  or  four  times.

Books and other writings are few among the

raptorans for another, more prosaic reason: books

are heavy items and hard to carry while  ying.

TUILVILANUUE PHRASEBOOK

The  following  raptoran  phrases  may  come  up  at  the

gaming table with some regularity. Depending on your

play style, you can use the actual Tuilvilanuue words

or their English translations when youre playing

a raptoran PC.

Lies va  iesta e  ies va liesta. Run from things that

 y and  y from things that run. This saying is basically a

practical take on how best to avoid various kinds of predators.

If you have more than one means of locomotion, use the one

your opponent doesnt have.

81

Na twa dima menti sintis, mil onit hista. When two minds

think  alike,  only  one  is  necessary.  This  axiom  reflects

the raptorans zest for debate and emphasizes the value of

the individual. After all, two people who share the same

thoughts cant provide each other with any new ideas or

fresh perspectives.

Fristi milta orisa nint. Anger is the one thing that grows

in connement. This phrase serves as a warning not to

keep hostile feelings bottled up too long. It also reminds

the listener that freedom is necessary for growth. Either

way, its good advice in the freewheeling atmosphere of a

raptoran ock.

Nilsi hentil kilta anno. It takes four seasons to make a

year. This saying is a reminder that theres a proper time for

everything. Winter is for dreams and slumber; spring is

for awakening and birth; summer is for life and love; autumn

is for gathering and for reection. Furthermore, you must

prepare ahead of time for whats coming next, be it a day or

a season. If you dont sleep, you wont be fresh for the next

day. If you dont get up, you cant hunt or work, and if you

dont hunt or work, you have nothing to get you through the

next day.

Menti lintu onlita venla op avel donlita venila. A mind opened

by wonder is clearer than one closed by belief. Another afr-

mation of the raptorans reliance on debate, this saying asks

the listener to seek a fresh outlook. To believe too strongly

in one viewpoint is to close yourself off to new and perhaps

better ideas.

Viilit nesla odelmin e van rensii, sil ti gar, odelmin vimil ginrinit.

The mouse fears the rising of the moon. But for the owl,

moonrise means its time to hunt. This thought also has a

double meaning. Most obviously, its better to be the hunter

than the hunted. The deeper meaning is that the timid fear

change (because things could get worse), but the courageous

embrace change (because things can get better).

Seniil limna! From the sky! This is the most common battle

cry of raptorans, who deliver it even if they arent ying at

the time.

Wylintasec mendilsi mentisinecta, sil viltima rentis da silliit altina.

Stupidity is a wound that bleeds forever. This is another

variation on the raptorans disdain for inexible thinking.

Vastikkimensa  hileka  belinnit  e  hastal  min  resinatadol,  sil

fostil nasila fenes e mastinnit. The careful hunter chooses

well and nishes with a full belly, but the fool wastes arrows

and goes hungry. This saying, similar to the Common

phrase  Haste  makes  waste,  speaks  to  the  raptorans

desire to mull things over carefully before committing to

a decision.

Nifmat orisa vilrad, sil nolim tramankit. A bad seed puts

forth a green shoot, but seldom a strong tree. Like many

other raptoran sayings, this one has a double meaning. On

one hand, even a plan that works well initially can still go

wrong. (The rst time may even have been a uke.) This

statement is also a variant on the Common aphorism Beware

of strangers bearing gifts. Something good that is given to

you by someone bad probably wont work out well.

Benisiim iltem rantoli rah silet nasilit. Wisilti maneti silti rah

silet veniin. The generous give more than they can. The proud

take less than they need. Essentially, this saying sums up the

raptorans view of a good life. Support your ock members

as much as possible, but try to demand as little of others as

you can.

RAPTORAN NAMES

Each raptoran has four names: a birth name received from

her parents, a nickname received from the ock, an adult

name that she chooses herself, and a family name. Adult

raptorans are often called by their nicknames within the

flock, but they use their adult names with those outside

the ock. The family name is used with either the nickname

or the adult name as an afrmation of heritage.

Because Tuilvilanuue and Elven descend from the same

root, the random name generator given for elves (see pages

3031) may also be used for raptorans.

EXAMPLE FLOCK:

THE RIFINTI

The Rinti are a typical raptoran ock. Their cliff dwelling

lies in a snug valley located in the foothills of sheltering

mountains  with  vast  mountain  lakes  and  alpine  forests

nearby and the vast rolling plains of the lowlands farther

on. They dont always claim the same territory for their camp

from one year to the nextif hunting is better or worse

in a particular area, theyll pay it more or less attention. In

general, the Rintis territory spans almost 2,000 square

miles of varied terrain. A nearby lakefed by runoff from

the mountainsoffers a good source of fresh water. A forest

around the lake has plenty of fruit trees, a few of which the

raptorans fell for lumber each year.

The Rinti ock consists of forty-one raptorans of adult

age or older (those with at least 1 HD), plus another twenty

young  and  noncombatants.  The  adults  spend  their  time

hunting, foraging, and crafting a variety of gear for the ock.

The average age of the ock is 155, and its oldest member,

Inkili the glassblower, is 267 years old.

IMPORTANT RIFINTI MEMBERS

The following NPCs are important members of the Rifinti

flock. They also have statistics appropriate for their station,

so you can use them even if you arent using the flock

in encounters.

Jenlisa Iltinger, Flock Chief

Jenlisa is the third cousin of the high chieftains children.

She inherited the leadership of the Rinti from her father,

who was the high chieftains second cousin, only three years

ago. Now approaching middle age, she has run the Rinti

ock with wisdom, fairness, and foresight.

When she became leader, she married Henesku Finlist,

the ocks medicine chief, who is a member of the ocks

largest  family.  Jenlisa  and  Henesku  have  remarried  every

year since, and they share the care of the four children that

they produced two years ago.

Jenlisa has been considering adding a third level, atop the

other two, to the rock-cut cave complex the Rinti call home.

A number of Rinti young adults are out on the Walk of the

Four Winds now; when they return, theyll probably marry

and raise broods of their own. The ock has been debating

the issue but hasnt reached a decision yet.

Recently  the  hunting  chief  has  been  seeing  small

groups  of  elves  in  the  vicinity  of  the  camp,  and  their

presence has sparked another debate about whether the

elves should be allowed to settle nearby. Jenlisa consid-

ers the whole topic prematureno one really knows the

long-term intentions of the elvesbut she fears that this

controversy combined with the war chiefs desire to foment

trouble may draw the flock into trouble larger than she

can manage.

Henesku Finlist, Medicine Chief

Henesku has always been a member of the Rinti. For the

past three years, he has been the chiefs husband, and he

secretly enjoys the prestige that position brings him. As an

added benet, while he is married to Jenlisa, his position as

medicine chief is secure.

Na twa dima menti sintis, mil onit hista. When two minds

think  alike,  only  one  is  necessary.  This  axiom  reflects

the raptorans zest for debate and emphasizes the value of

the individual. After all, two people who share the same

thoughts cant provide each other with any new ideas or

fresh perspectives.

Fristi milta orisa nint. Anger is the one thing that grows

in connement. This phrase serves as a warning not to

keep hostile feelings bottled up too long. It also reminds

the listener that freedom is necessary for growth. Either

way, its good advice in the freewheeling atmosphere of a

raptoran ock.

Nilsi hentil kilta anno. It takes four seasons to make a

year. This saying is a reminder that theres a proper time for

everything. Winter is for dreams and slumber; spring is

for awakening and birth; summer is for life and love; autumn

is for gathering and for reection. Furthermore, you must

prepare ahead of time for whats coming next, be it a day or

a season. If you dont sleep, you wont be fresh for the next

day. If you dont get up, you cant hunt or work, and if you

dont hunt or work, you have nothing to get you through the

next day.

Menti lintu onlita venla op avel donlita venila. A mind opened

by wonder is clearer than one closed by belief. Another afr-

mation of the raptorans reliance on debate, this saying asks

the listener to seek a fresh outlook. To believe too strongly

in one viewpoint is to close yourself off to new and perhaps

better ideas.

Viilit nesla odelmin e van rensii, sil ti gar, odelmin vimil ginrinit.

The mouse fears the rising of the moon. But for the owl,

moonrise means its time to hunt. This thought also has a

double meaning. Most obviously, its better to be the hunter

than the hunted. The deeper meaning is that the timid fear

change (because things could get worse), but the courageous

embrace change (because things can get better).

Seniil limna! From the sky! This is the most common battle

cry of raptorans, who deliver it even if they arent ying at

the time.

Wylintasec mendilsi mentisinecta, sil viltima rentis da silliit altina.

Stupidity is a wound that bleeds forever. This is another

variation on the raptorans disdain for inexible thinking.

Vastikkimensa  hileka  belinnit  e  hastal  min  resinatadol,  sil

fostil nasila fenes e mastinnit. The careful hunter chooses

well and nishes with a full belly, but the fool wastes arrows

and goes hungry. This saying, similar to the Common

phrase  Haste  makes  waste,  speaks  to  the  raptorans

desire to mull things over carefully before committing to

a decision.

Nifmat orisa vilrad, sil nolim tramankit. A bad seed puts

forth a green shoot, but seldom a strong tree. Like many

other raptoran sayings, this one has a double meaning. On

one hand, even a plan that works well initially can still go

wrong. (The rst time may even have been a uke.) This

statement is also a variant on the Common aphorism Beware

of strangers bearing gifts. Something good that is given to

you by someone bad probably wont work out well.

Benisiim iltem rantoli rah silet nasilit. Wisilti maneti silti rah

silet veniin. The generous give more than they can. The proud

take less than they need. Essentially, this saying sums up the

raptorans view of a good life. Support your ock members

as much as possible, but try to demand as little of others as

you can.

RAPTORAN NAMES

Each raptoran has four names: a birth name received from

her parents, a nickname received from the ock, an adult

name that she chooses herself, and a family name. Adult

raptorans are often called by their nicknames within the

flock, but they use their adult names with those outside

the ock. The family name is used with either the nickname

or the adult name as an afrmation of heritage.

Because Tuilvilanuue and Elven descend from the same

root, the random name generator given for elves (see pages

3031) may also be used for raptorans.

EXAMPLE FLOCK:

THE RIFINTI

The Rinti are a typical raptoran ock. Their cliff dwelling

lies in a snug valley located in the foothills of sheltering

mountains  with  vast  mountain  lakes  and  alpine  forests

nearby and the vast rolling plains of the lowlands farther

on. They dont always claim the same territory for their camp

from one year to the nextif hunting is better or worse

in a particular area, theyll pay it more or less attention. In

general, the Rintis territory spans almost 2,000 square

miles of varied terrain. A nearby lakefed by runoff from

the mountainsoffers a good source of fresh water. A forest

around the lake has plenty of fruit trees, a few of which the

raptorans fell for lumber each year.

The Rinti ock consists of forty-one raptorans of adult

age or older (those with at least 1 HD), plus another twenty

young  and  noncombatants.  The  adults  spend  their  time

hunting, foraging, and crafting a variety of gear for the ock.

The average age of the ock is 155, and its oldest member,

Inkili the glassblower, is 267 years old.

IMPORTANT RIFINTI MEMBERS

The following NPCs are important members of the Rifinti

flock. They also have statistics appropriate for their station,

so you can use them even if you arent using the flock

in encounters.

Jenlisa Iltinger, Flock Chief

Jenlisa is the third cousin of the high chieftains children.

She inherited the leadership of the Rinti from her father,

who was the high chieftains second cousin, only three years

ago. Now approaching middle age, she has run the Rinti

ock with wisdom, fairness, and foresight.

When she became leader, she married Henesku Finlist,

the ocks medicine chief, who is a member of the ocks

largest  family.  Jenlisa  and  Henesku  have  remarried  every

year since, and they share the care of the four children that

they produced two years ago.

Jenlisa has been considering adding a third level, atop the

other two, to the rock-cut cave complex the Rinti call home.

A number of Rinti young adults are out on the Walk of the

Four Winds now; when they return, theyll probably marry

and raise broods of their own. The ock has been debating

the issue but hasnt reached a decision yet.

Recently  the  hunting  chief  has  been  seeing  small

groups  of  elves  in  the  vicinity  of  the  camp,  and  their

presence has sparked another debate about whether the

elves should be allowed to settle nearby. Jenlisa consid-

ers the whole topic prematureno one really knows the

long-term intentions of the elvesbut she fears that this

controversy combined with the war chiefs desire to foment

trouble may draw the flock into trouble larger than she

can manage.

A cleric of Tuilviel Glithien, Henesku sees to the physical

and spiritual health of the flock. During the spring and

summer, he leads teams that forage for medicinal herbs and

renders them into healing salves and potions. He is quite

busy healing the many wounds that result from hunting and

skirmishes with predators.

Four years ago, a previously unknown disease broke out

within the  ock. Though only a few members actually suc-

cumbed, so many were sick for so long that not enough food

was gathered and the  ock barely survived the next winter.

Henesku has noticed that many  ock members seem fatigued

of late, and he worries that another outbreak of disease may

be imminent. Thus, he has been badgering the hunting chief

and the supply chief to accumulate extra stores.

Henesku and Jenlisa present a united front on every-

thing  but  religious  mattersJenlisa  venerates  Tuilviel

Glithien, but demurs if anyone asks her whether its more

Chanil Akiilin, War Chief

This year is Chanils  rst as war chief. He has long been

the  nest hunter in the  ock, and he covets the position of

hunting chief, but Jenlisa continues to grant that to an older

raptoran. Jenlisa claims that Chanils success in hunting is

due primarily to his ability to know his opponents next

move, and that this quality will make him a good war chief.

In truth, however, she fears that he is so good at hunting that

he could reduce the nearby animal population below the level

of sustainability if left unchecked.

Now that Chanil is war chief, however, he is determined

to do a good job. He takes care of the day-to-day business,

coordinating the sentries and ensuring the defense of the

community. Nevertheless, he chafes at the bit for someone

to make war with. His team successfully drove off another

 ock that challenged the Ri nti for a nearby vale, but that

was only a shouting matchnot real war.

A  controversy  has  been  brewing  of  late  because  the

hunting chief, Miithi, has been clandestinely meeting elf

women from across the lake. This practice has sparked a

major debate about whether the raptorans should allow

anyone to settle so near to the Ri nti cliff dwellings, even

if they promise friendship. Chanil has been subtly encour-

aging Miithi to meet with the elves more often, offering

to take over supervision of the hunting parties while he

is gone. The war chief hopes that Miithi will anger the

elves and Chanil will get his chance to prove his mettle

in war.

In preparation for such an event, he has been stockpiling

weapons as though the  ock is about to come under siege

and training the  ock in weapon use for long hours every

night, sometimes extending into dawn.

Languages: Common, Tuilvilanuue.

Animal Companion (Ex): Chanil has a dire bat (see page

62 of the Monster Manual) named Nightwing as an animal

companion.

Animal Companion Bene  ts: Chanil and Nightwing

enjoy the link special quality. (Chanils Wisdom is too low

for him to be able to cast ranger spells, so he and Nightwing

gain no bene t from the share spells special quality.)

Link (Ex): Chanil can handle Nightwing as a free action.

He also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy

checks  and  Handle  Animal  checks  made  regarding  his

dire bat.

Evasion (Ex): If Chanil is exposed to any effect that

normally  allows  him  to  attempt  a  Reflex  saving  throw

for  half  damage,  he  takes  no  damage  with  a  successful

saving throw.

Favored Enemy (Ex): Chanil gains a +6 bonus on his

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when

using these skills against animals. He gains the same bonus

on weapon damage.

Against elves and magical beasts, he gains a +2 bonus on

these skill checks and on weapon damage rolls.

Raptoran Traits: Raptorans can glide at a speed of 40

feet,  with  average  maneuverability.  Raptorans  have  an

unerring sense of direction and always know which way

is north. Chanil can  y for up to 10 minutes total during a

day before becoming fatigued. A  ying raptoran can make a

dive attack (as a charge, but must  y at least 30 feet, descend

at least 10 feet, and use a piercing weapon to deal double

damage on a hit).

Swift Tracker (Ex): Track at normal speed without taking

the usual 5 penalty, or can track at double speed at only a

10 penalty.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Chanil can move through natural

thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his

normal speed and without damage or other impairment.

However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically

manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

Possessions: +2 mithral chain shirt, +1 ring of protection, +1

Dexterity +2, 20 pp.

Delembril Vintagil, Supply Chief

Delembril  has  held  several  positions  within  the  flock

over her long span of years, and she has been supply chief

before as well. Having reached late middle age, she is not

as spry or as patient as she once was and has grown a bit

snappish in her replies to unusual situations and demands.

This curmudgeonly quality is one of the primary reasons

that  Jenlisa  appointed  her  to  this  position;  her  attitude

ensures  that  people  wont  ask  for  anything  unless  they

truly need it.

Delembril knows one of the cisterns needs to be replaced,

but she doesnt want to send out a crew to do that until she

A  controversy  has  been  brewing  of  late  because  the

hunting chief, Miithi, has been clandestinely meeting elf

women from across the lake. This practice has sparked a

major debate about whether the raptorans should allow

anyone to settle so near to the Ri nti cliff dwellings, even

if they promise friendship. Chanil has been subtly encour-

aging Miithi to meet with the elves more often, offering

to take over supervision of the hunting parties while he

is gone. The war chief hopes that Miithi will anger the

elves and Chanil will get his chance to prove his mettle

in war.

In preparation for such an event, he has been stockpiling

weapons as though the  ock is about to come under siege

and training the  ock in weapon use for long hours every

night, sometimes extending into dawn.

Animal Companion (Ex): Chanil has a dire bat (see page

62 of the Monster Manual) named Nightwing as an animal

companion.

Animal Companion Bene  ts: Chanil and Nightwing

enjoy the link special quality. (Chanils Wisdom is too low

for him to be able to cast ranger spells, so he and Nightwing

gain no bene t from the share spells special quality.)

Link (Ex): Chanil can handle Nightwing as a free action.

He also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy

checks  and  Handle  Animal  checks  made  regarding  his

dire bat.

Evasion (Ex): If Chanil is exposed to any effect that

normally  allows  him  to  attempt  a  Reflex  saving  throw

for  half  damage,  he  takes  no  damage  with  a  successful

saving throw.

Favored Enemy (Ex): Chanil gains a +6 bonus on his

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when

using these skills against animals. He gains the same bonus

on weapon damage.

Against elves and magical beasts, he gains a +2 bonus on

these skill checks and on weapon damage rolls.

Raptoran Traits: Raptorans can glide at a speed of 40

feet,  with  average  maneuverability.  Raptorans  have  an

unerring sense of direction and always know which way

is north. Chanil can  y for up to 10 minutes total during a

day before becoming fatigued. A  ying raptoran can make a

dive attack (as a charge, but must  y at least 30 feet, descend

at least 10 feet, and use a piercing weapon to deal double

damage on a hit).

Swift Tracker (Ex): Track at normal speed without taking

the usual 5 penalty, or can track at double speed at only a

10 penalty.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Chanil can move through natural

thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his

normal speed and without damage or other impairment.

However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically

manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

Possessions: +2 mithral chain shirt, +1 ring of protection, +1

Delembril Vintagil, Supply Chief

Delembril  has  held  several  positions  within  the  flock

over her long span of years, and she has been supply chief

before as well. Having reached late middle age, she is not

as spry or as patient as she once was and has grown a bit

snappish in her replies to unusual situations and demands.

This curmudgeonly quality is one of the primary reasons

that  Jenlisa  appointed  her  to  this  position;  her  attitude

ensures  that  people  wont  ask  for  anything  unless  they

truly need it.

Delembril knows one of the cisterns needs to be replaced,

but she doesnt want to send out a crew to do that until she

One style of raptoran cliff dwelling

knows whether the ock is going to carve out a new level

into the living rock of the cliff face. A leaky cistern is one

thing, but that amount of excavation will tax the flocks

resources to the utmost. That decision has already dragged

out for far too long in debate, primarily because everyone

is now busy whispering about the elves in the area. Of all

the useless nonsense!

To make matters worse, the war chief is constantly after

her to make more charcoal to re the forge for weapons. Shes

reminded him several times that you cant make charcoal to

re the forge in a day, but he doesnt listen. There isnt much

metal anyway, so hell have to be content with making bows

and arrows rather than stockpiling foot spikes and swords.

Unless, of course, someone else in this community (namely

Miithi, the hunting chief) wants to ask his elf friends if theyll

trade for some more metal.

On top of all that, Henesku has been whining that the

ock needs extra food stores because everyone looks fatigued.

Of course people are tired! Who wouldnt be from all that

weapon practice?

Miithi Xantiro, Hunting Chief

Miithi  has  been  hunting  chief  for  a  long  time  and  was

hoping to take a break from that position this year. One of

his best young hunters, Chanil Akiilin, had been hoping to

be appointed for some time, but he was given the position

of war chief instead. Still, Jenlisa is a wise woman, and she

probably had a good reason for that decision.

Lately, Miithi has had his hands full training the young

members of the ock to hunt. For some reason, they seem

less focused than the youth of previous seasons, and he has

had a difcult time getting them to concentrate on the task

at hand. They seem overtired.

Miithi  is  tired  himselfbecause  he  has  been  making

midnight ights across the lake to spend time with a small

group of elf females. One of the elves has been giving him

lessons in magic, bringing out the innate magical ability

that he never knew he had. Miithi has mentioned the elves

to Jenlisa, but he hasnt said anything about the magic les-

sons. Nor has he spoken of the fact that he sometimes cant

remember any details of his visits to the elves.

Game has been plentiful this season, and Miithi has had

no difculty meeting Heneskus demands for more food to

store. Delembril, the supply chief, has had to scramble to get

all that meat dried and nd places to store it, but the ocks

lands have provided well this season.

Jantril Sestriin, Star Chief

Jantril is new to the position of star chief and eager to make

her mark. She dreams of being immortalized in a constel-

lation, the way legend says that raptorans have been in the

past. To do that, she has to make sure that everyone in the

ock is paying enough attention to celestial matters. Right

now, the war chief has everyone practicing with weapons

night and day as if war were imminent. When theyre not

practicing, theyre debating over whether to expand their

home and how close those elves should be allowed to settle

nearby. The stars favor the expansion of the cliff-dwelling,

but they make ominous hints that the elves are not what

they seem to be.

Jantril Sestriins statistics are presented in the description

of the skypledged prestige class (see page 126).

Elissto Nisian, Sunspeaker

Everybody is being exceptionally silly lately. So the old

guy is talking to some elves. Big deal. Those who patrol the

perimeter know perfectly well what hes been doinghes

been getting magical instruction. Who better to get it from

than an elf? Even if that werent the purpose of his meet-

ings, all this debate about raptorans and elves is a bunch

of  hooey.  They  ought  to  be  talking  about  the  proposed

expansion issue, not ghting about who lives where. The

ock members on the Walk of the Four Winds could begin

to return shortly, so a decision on creating new nests needs

to be made soon.

Everyone is unusually quarrelsome lately, probably because

theyre so tired. Not in all the years that Elissto has been

sunspeaker have raptorans routinely practiced past dawn with

weapons. If someone doesnt put a stop to this madness, he

may have to start knocking heads together.

Elissto has been the ocks sunspeaker for over a decade

now, and he is much more in tune with the outside world

than anyone else in his ock. He has considerable charm

Jantril Sestriin, Star Chief

Jantril is new to the position of star chief and eager to make

her mark. She dreams of being immortalized in a constel-

lation, the way legend says that raptorans have been in the

past. To do that, she has to make sure that everyone in the

ock is paying enough attention to celestial matters. Right

now, the war chief has everyone practicing with weapons

night and day as if war were imminent. When theyre not

practicing, theyre debating over whether to expand their

home and how close those elves should be allowed to settle

nearby. The stars favor the expansion of the cliff-dwelling,

but they make ominous hints that the elves are not what

they seem to be.

Jantril Sestriins statistics are presented in the description

of the skypledged prestige class (see page 126).

Elissto Nisian, Sunspeaker

Everybody is being exceptionally silly lately. So the old

guy is talking to some elves. Big deal. Those who patrol the

perimeter know perfectly well what hes been doinghes

been getting magical instruction. Who better to get it from

than an elf? Even if that werent the purpose of his meet-

ings, all this debate about raptorans and elves is a bunch

of  hooey.  They  ought  to  be  talking  about  the  proposed

expansion issue, not ghting about who lives where. The

ock members on the Walk of the Four Winds could begin

to return shortly, so a decision on creating new nests needs

to be made soon.

Everyone is unusually quarrelsome lately, probably because

theyre so tired. Not in all the years that Elissto has been

sunspeaker have raptorans routinely practiced past dawn with

weapons. If someone doesnt put a stop to this madness, he

may have to start knocking heads together.

Elissto has been the ocks sunspeaker for over a decade

now, and he is much more in tune with the outside world

than anyone else in his ock. He has considerable charm

RIFINTI CLIFF DWELLING

The members of the Ri nti  ock have used the same rock-cut

cliff dwelling as their home for generations. The lake below

provides  an  excellent  source  of  fresh  water  and   sh,  and

the sand from nearby beaches is valuable for glassmaking.

Some nearby ridges provide good perches for the sentries,

and caves and crevices in which to cache food are plentiful.

The recently arrived elves have a small community directly

across the lake from the raptorans cliff dwelling.

Although there are several all-purpose rooms within the

cliff dwelling that can be used as workshops in periods of

bad weather, most of the  ocks crafter areas are atop the

cliff, with the cliff dwelling itself mainly devoted to living

space and meeting rooms (the Great Hall, the chapel, and

so forth). Midway between the rock-cut dwelling, with its

distinctive  T-shaped  entrances  dotting  the  cliffside,  and

the clifftop itself is a lofty natural cave chamber known

as Tuilviels Glittercave, which serves as the  ocks largest

indoor meeting place. The Glittercave can only be reached

by  ying and thus is only accessible to full adults of the tribe

(those who have completed the Walk of the Four Winds)

who can  y there under their own power. This area also

serves as a temple to Tuilviel, the Queen of Air and Night.

Her worshipers end each service by taking off, giving her

homage through night  ights.

The clifftop work areas include two stone furnaces and

an oven. One furnace is used as a forge for weaponsmithing

and repair; the other serves as a glassmaking furnace and

occasionally as a kiln for potterythe  ock plans to make

a separate kiln within the next year or two. The oven is used

for cooking and baking  atbread from acorn  our or other

grains acquired in trade. Small latticework huts with thatch

roofs hold weavers looms and the other workshops that keep

the  ock busy, prosperous, and healthy.

Ri  nti Camp (thorp): Magical; AL CG; population 40;

CREATING RAPTORAN

CHARACTERS

Raptoran characters obey all the rules for characters described

in the Players Handbook.

When  you  create  a  raptoran  character,  remember  that

buying ranks in Climb, Jump, and Spot always pays, even if

those are cross-class skills, because they play directly into

the raptorans racial skill modiers. Likewise, you should

be alert for chances to exploit the maneuverability of the

raptoran once you earn your wings, choosing feats (such as

Mobility) and skills (such as Tumble) that help you move

around safely.

However, once youve gained the ability to y, you face the

dilemma of carrying gear around. You cant take ight with

anything heavier than a light load, so your equipment choices

are constrained. Consider other ways to boost your Armor

Class, because you wont be able to y in heavy armor.

As a raptoran, you qualify for some specic feats that greatly

benet ying characters and for raptoran-specic prestige

classes (described in this book) that are unavailable to PCs

of other races.

Feats: Aerial Reflexes, Aerial Superiority, Born Flyer,

Diving Charge, Improved Flight, Plunging Shot.

Prestige Classes: Skypledged, stormtalon.

RAPTORANS AS CHARACTERS

Fundamentally, the class you choose determines more about

your character than any other choice you make. While cleric

is the raptorans favored class, the races community-based

lifestyle relies on teamwork; thus, raptorans of other classes

are quite common.

Barbarian: Many raptorans nd the barbarian class appeal-

ing because it allows them to live close to nature, unfettered

by the social mores that bind more civilized folk. Even young

raptorans are natural jumpers and benet from a barbarians

fast movement. A side effect of a barbarians rage is that he

can stay aloft a little longer, but low-level raptoran barbarians

risk exhausting themselves if they gain fatigue both from

ying too long and from raging.

Bard: Raptorans have a strong oral tradition, so bards are

quite common. Their persuasive abilities also make them

masters of debate, thus raising their status even more in the

eyes of the community. More raptoran bards take ranks in

Perform (oratory) than in any of the musical categories of

the skill.

Cleric: Clerics are quite useful to the raptoran commu-

nity, both as sources of healing and as versatile spellcasters.

Raptoran clerics usually wear only light armor because any

heavier kind interferes with their ability to y; shield of faith

and entropic shield can help compensate.

For  alternative  options  for  the  raptoran  cleric,  see  the

raptoran racial substitution levels on page 160.

Druid: Like barbarians, druids are children of nature

something that holds considerable appeal for raptorans.

Raptoran druids can help with healing just as clerics can,

and they can also use wild shape to gain damaging natural

weapons. Raptoran druids usually choose birds such as owls

and hawks as animal companions.

Fighter: A raptoran ghter is more maneuverable than

ghters  of  most  other  races  because  of  her  ability  to  y.

Though she faces the same armor problem as a cleric does,

ying is very useful for her ranged attacks, particularly when

combined with Shot on the Run and other archery-oriented

feats, most of which a ghter can pick up as bonus feats.

For alternative options for the raptoran ghter, see the

raptoran racial substitution levels on page 161.

Monk:  Few  raptorans  ever  choose  the  path  of  monk

because most members of the race are chaotic. Those who do

feel the need for more order in their lives can make surpris-

ingly effective monks. Their ability to y makes certain monk

abilities (such as slow fall) less relevant, but fast movement

gives raptoran monks an extraordinarily fast land speed to

match or exceed their speed in the air.

Paladin: Raptoran paladins are even rarer than raptoran

monks because of the alignment requirement and the lack of

lawful good deities in the raptoran pantheon. Nevertheless,

those who do exist are respected and valued in their com-

munities. They have the same ranged weapon advantages and

problems with armor as raptoran ghters.

Ranger: Like the druid and the barbarian, the ranger is

close to nature, but a raptoran ranger is also an amazingly

effective ghting machine when he takes the archery combat

style. The raptorans racial skill bonuses match the rangers

class  skills  well,  making  him  exceptionally  effective  at

spotting enemies and keeping up with them. Most raptoran

rangers choose night birds as animal companions, though

other choices are suitable.

Rogue: The raptorans maneuverability on the battleeld

and racial skill bonuses play directly to the strengths of the

rogue class. A raptoran rogues ability to y enables her to

reach lucrative treasures that others cant. Most raptoran

rogues focus on wilderness skills rather than urban-oriented

ones such as Open Lock and Disable Device.

Sorcerer: Sorcerer is a natural choice for a raptoran arcane

spellcaster because he need not carry spellbooks around as

he moves from place to place. Raptorans also respect innate

spell ability, considering it a gift from the stars. The sorcerers

(usually) high charisma also comes in handy for debating.

For alternative options for the raptoran sorcerer, see the

raptoran racial substitution levels on page 162.

Wizard: Raptorans dont like to carry books, so wizards

are somewhat rare. A few, however, take up the class because

it enables them to use their minds. Others are attracted to it

because it offers the option to specialize.

he  wild  teems  with  life.  Elves,  halings,  and

raptorans live and travel through lands inhabited

by restless animals, powerful monsters, and other

intelligent races. The races described here all have

some connection to the races of the wild described

in the rst three chapters of this book, even if it

is simply living in the same regions and competing for the

same  resources.  The  races  here  embody  variations  on  the

ideas and abilities of the more common races and provide

opportunities to play characters with unusual outlooks,

physiologies, or histories.

USING THIS CHAPTER

These races are presented as options for PCs. Additionally,

these  races  give  Dungeon  Masters  new  options  when

building  foes  to  confront  the  players  or  unusual  NPCs

for  them  to  encounter.  A  trek  through  the  wild  lands

proves  more  interesting  if  the  characters  notice  differ-

ences  in  environment  and  culture  as  they  travel.  This

chapter helps establish the differences between such races

and regions.

WHERE WERE THEY?

In many ongoing campaigns, introducing new races can be

difcult. For instance, catfolk cant simply wander out of

the plains and claim to have been allies with the elves for

countless human generations, nor can centaurs suddenly

claim  a  prominence  in  the  campaign  equal  to  that  of

halings or elves. The following suggestions should give

players and DMs some ideas for including new races in

an existing campaign.

Distant Region or Continent: One obvious explana-

tion for a race not being present in the campaign until

now is that there is some signicant geographical barrier

between the races homeland and the main region of the

campaign. The race might dwell behind an impassable

mountain range, across a great ocean, or in the depths

of a vast and magical forest.

Minority Population: In this scenario, the new

race has indeed been in the campaign world all along,

but its population is so small that its members dwell

completely within the shelter of a more numerous

race, and the majority ultimately overshadows the

minority. Although none of the races presented in

this chapter use this option as their default back-

ground, you can easily adapt the races here to use

this option in your own campaign.

Recent Offshoot: It could be that the new race

is actually a newly emerging species, having appeared

over the last few generations as a result of huge magi-

cal  uctuations  or  natural  mutation.  The  killoren,

91

a humanlike race of fey introduced in this chapter, are an

example of a newly emerging race.

CATFOLK RACIAL TRAITS

MONSTER CLASSES

Several of the races described here use the monster class

rules  detailed  in  Savage  Species.  The  centaur  monster  class

presented in this chapter was  rst detailed in that book. It

is not necessary that you have Savage Species in order to use

these classes. Monster classes work just like other classes,

with the following exceptions:

When using monster classes to create a character, you can

ignore level adjustment. This is replaced by the characters

monster class level. (The level adjustment is, in effect, built

into the monster classs level progression.)

The only way to take a level of a monster class is to be

that monster. A centaur cannot multiclass as a gnoll,

nor can a human fighter multiclass to take levels as a

centaur. She must begin taking levels in the monster

class at 1st level.

Monster classes do not grant a character skill points or

Hit Dice at every level, nor do they grant a feat every three

levels. When a level grants skill points, a Hit Die, or a feat,

the gain is noted on the class table.

Each monster class has a CR (Challenge Rating) entry. This

has no meaning for players or PCs and is given only as an

aid to DMs who want to adjust monster CRs by regressing

existing creatures.

A monster character using a monster class cannot multi-

class  until  she  completes  the  full  progression  in  her

monster class. This rule keeps characters from gaining the

bene ts of a monsters type and then quickly switching to

a standard class. However, a DM may explicitly waive this

rule (of cially declaring a variant ruling) if he desires a

slightly higher-powered campaign.

A monster class does not impose an experience penalty

for multiclassing, as other classes do.

Wherever the plains take me, that is where I will wander.

CATFOLK

Marrash of the Flying Eagle Tribe, catfolk scout

The great tribes of the catfolk roam where they will, putting

passion into every day of their varied lives.

Catfolk nomads roam the grassy plains, living in tribes

segregated by their visual differences. Catfolk tribes range

from friendly to hostile; encounters with catfolk depend more

on an individual catfolks mood and the circumstance more

than any tribal mind-set. Quick in movement and thought,

the  catfolk  rely  on  short  bursts  of  energy  to  accomplish

nearly every task, making the other races seem plodding and

dedicated in comparison.

Catfolk resemble a cross between a large predatory cat and

a human, with a sleekly muscled humanoid body and the

head and mane of a feline. Most male catfolk wear their

thick hair in braids, while females keep theirs short and

sleek. The most common catfolk have feline characteris-

tics  reminiscent  of  lions,  including  thick  manes  for  the

males. Other groups have the characteristic markings and

appearance of leopards, tigers, or cheetahs. Catfolk have

thicker nails than other humanoids, but not the powerful

claws of their feline counterparts, and they make unarmed

attacks  just  like  humans.  Many  catfolk  favor  the  use  of

charms and totems that they braid into their hair for luck

in battle, success on the hunt, and good fortune in other

such endeavors.

Catfolk speak Common and a language called Feline (each

tribe speaking a dialect). Brighter catfolk often learn the

languages of gnolls and hal ings.

Catfolk characters possess the following racial traits:

+4 Dexterity, +2 Charisma.

A catfolks base land speed is 40 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Catfolk can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Racial Skills: Catfolk have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and

Move Silently checks.

+1 natural armor bonus.

Automatic Languages: Common, Feline. Bonus Languages:

Draconic, Gnoll, Hal ing, Sylvan.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Level adjustment +1.

CATFOLK SOCIETY

Catfolk maintain a tribal society similar to that of many

nomadic human cultures.

Lands: Catfolk roam the open grasslands in temper-

ate and tropical regions, shunning the colder lands even

in  the  heights  of  summer.  Wandering  tribes  of  catfolk

rarely  come  close  to  the  large  cities  of  other  races,  but

they  occasionally  camp  within  sight  of  a  smaller  town

or village in order to trade. Catfolk roam great distances

in their travels and do not become attached to a specific

range or territory the way that nomadic tribes of humans

sometimes do.

Settlements: Catfolk encampments balance defensibility

with ease of escape from a dangerous area. Generally circular

in nature, catfolk encampments center on a communal area

where children play and the elders care for them and practice

their crafts. The tents and lean-tos of individual families range

out from this center, with the most able warriors occupying

tents on the perimeter of the encampment.

Power Groups: With no large nations or powerful alli-

ance of tribes to bind them together, catfolk experience

little of the politics and power struggles that de ne the

societies of other races. Instead, most tribes receive

guidance from three sources: the outriders, the

druids, and the chieftain. The outriders are the

most skilled scouts of the tribe, and they govern

the direction that the tribe hunts and travels, unless

the  chieftain  overrules  their  choice.  The  druids,

the primary source of healing and magical power

within the society, hold a great deal of

in uence  over  most  aspects  of  catfolk

life  and  often  advise  the  chieftain  on

important matters. The chieftain makes

decisions  on  everything  that  affects

the tribe as a whole.

Beliefs: A deeply spiritual people,

cat folk usually worship one deity to the ex-

clusion of others. Most catfolk follow the

precepts  of  Obad-Hai,  and  their  most

prominent religious  gures are druids

devoted to the service of the god of na-

ture. Catfolk revere Obad-Hai more for

his connection to natures power and

his governance of plants and animals

than for his connection to the primary elemental forces

such as  re or water.

Other catfolk, particularly adventurers and travelers, pay

homage to Fharlanghn. While most tribes of catfolk move

around in a nomadic fashion, a few travel much more than

others and keep Fharlanghn as their primary deity.

Relations:  Catfolk  get  along  well  with  members  of

just  about  every  other  race.  They  admire  those  who  live

in the wild more than city dwellers. Because of this, they

seek out the company of hal ings, wood elves, and gnolls.

Catfolk have a hard time understanding the slow, steady

approach that dwarves take to life, and the two races have

little in common. Because they are such opposites in both

temperament  and  physical  abilities,  catfolk  and  dwarves

rarely enjoy the others company, although no real animosity

exists between the races.

CATFOLK CHARACTERS

Agile and charismatic, catfolk characters make excellent

rogues and rangers.

Adventuring  Catfolk:  Adventuring  catfolk  feel  the

restlessness common to their people more acutely than most.

The thrill of discovery and a great sense of curiosity drive

these adventurers to break from their tribes and wander other

lands. Beyond simple wanderlust, some catfolk  nd the heat

of  combat  exhilarating,  and  the  rush  of  danger  draws  the

catfolk adventurer ever onward.

Catfolk  admire  adventurers  and  see  accomplished

adventurers as great assets to the tribe. The nomadic life

of  the  catfolk  is  fraught  with  danger  and  unexpected

encounters, and the life of the typical catfolk is more akin

to that of an adventurer than the life of a typical human

or elf.

Female catfolk

Male catfolk

Character Development: Catfolk should select feats

and skills that take advantage of their high Dexterity or

mitigate the drawbacks of their +1 level adjustment. The

easiest way to do this is through ranged combatit turns

the catfolks high Dexterity into a bonus on attack rolls

and  keeps  the  monsters  at  a  distance,  minimizing  the

catfolks lack of a Hit Die relative to other characters of

the same ECL.

Character Names: Catfolk favor names that begin with

D, M, or N and contain multiple s and r sounds. A

catfolk clan name translates into Common as a participle

(a verb made into an adjective by adding -ing) followed by

a noun.

Male Names: Densharr, Mersharr, Nermissar, Therrass.

Female  Names:  Dessirris,  Mianissa,  Morasha,  Nera,

Thessana.

Clan Names: Flying Eagle, Hunting Tiger, Running Brook,

Screaming Arrow.

ROLEPLAYING A CATFOLK

Catfolk respond to the varied experiences of life with passion

and emotional intensity. They accomplish as much in their

quick but short-lived bursts of activity or emotion as other

races do at their relatively plodding pace. Catfolk relish both

the heated ferocity of battle and the warmth of a quiet meal

with trusted companions.

Personality: Catfolk share a quick and engaging con-

 dence that makes them seem always ready for the next

challenge. Quick to anger and just as quick to forgive, catfolk

live a life  lled with emotion. Members of most races  nd

catfolk pleasant company despite their mercurial tempera-

a humanlike race of fey introduced in this chapter, are an

example of a newly emerging race.

a human, with a sleekly muscled humanoid body and the

head and mane of a feline. Most male catfolk wear their

thick hair in braids, while females keep theirs short and

sleek. The most common catfolk have feline characteris-

tics  reminiscent  of  lions,  including  thick  manes  for  the

males. Other groups have the characteristic markings and

appearance of leopards, tigers, or cheetahs. Catfolk have

thicker nails than other humanoids, but not the powerful

claws of their feline counterparts, and they make unarmed

attacks  just  like  humans.  Many  catfolk  favor  the  use  of

charms and totems that they braid into their hair for luck

in battle, success on the hunt, and good fortune in other

such endeavors.

Catfolk speak Common and a language called Feline (each

tribe speaking a dialect). Brighter catfolk often learn the

languages of gnolls and hal ings.

Catfolk characters possess the following racial traits:

+4 Dexterity, +2 Charisma.

A catfolks base land speed is 40 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Catfolk can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Racial Skills: Catfolk have a +2 racial bonus on Listen and

Move Silently checks.

+1 natural armor bonus.

Automatic Languages: Common, Feline. Bonus Languages:

Draconic, Gnoll, Hal ing, Sylvan.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Level adjustment +1.

CATFOLK SOCIETY

Catfolk maintain a tribal society similar to that of many

nomadic human cultures.

Lands: Catfolk roam the open grasslands in temper-

ate and tropical regions, shunning the colder lands even

in  the  heights  of  summer.  Wandering  tribes  of  catfolk

rarely  come  close  to  the  large  cities  of  other  races,  but

they  occasionally  camp  within  sight  of  a  smaller  town

or village in order to trade. Catfolk roam great distances

in their travels and do not become attached to a specific

range or territory the way that nomadic tribes of humans

sometimes do.

Settlements: Catfolk encampments balance defensibility

with ease of escape from a dangerous area. Generally circular

in nature, catfolk encampments center on a communal area

where children play and the elders care for them and practice

their crafts. The tents and lean-tos of individual families range

out from this center, with the most able warriors occupying

tents on the perimeter of the encampment.

Power Groups: With no large nations or powerful alli-

ance of tribes to bind them together, catfolk experience

little of the politics and power struggles that de ne the

societies of other races. Instead, most tribes receive

guidance from three sources: the outriders, the

druids, and the chieftain. The outriders are the

most skilled scouts of the tribe, and they govern

the direction that the tribe hunts and travels, unless

the  chieftain  overrules  their  choice.  The  druids,

the primary source of healing and magical power

within the society, hold a great deal of

in uence  over  most  aspects  of  catfolk

life  and  often  advise  the  chieftain  on

important matters. The chieftain makes

decisions  on  everything  that  affects

the tribe as a whole.

Beliefs: A deeply spiritual people,

cat folk usually worship one deity to the ex-

clusion of others. Most catfolk follow the

precepts  of  Obad-Hai,  and  their  most

prominent religious  gures are druids

devoted to the service of the god of na-

ture. Catfolk revere Obad-Hai more for

his connection to natures power and

his governance of plants and animals

than for his connection to the primary elemental forces

such as  re or water.

Other catfolk, particularly adventurers and travelers, pay

homage to Fharlanghn. While most tribes of catfolk move

around in a nomadic fashion, a few travel much more than

others and keep Fharlanghn as their primary deity.

Relations:  Catfolk  get  along  well  with  members  of

just  about  every  other  race.  They  admire  those  who  live

in the wild more than city dwellers. Because of this, they

seek out the company of hal ings, wood elves, and gnolls.

Catfolk have a hard time understanding the slow, steady

approach that dwarves take to life, and the two races have

little in common. Because they are such opposites in both

temperament  and  physical  abilities,  catfolk  and  dwarves

rarely enjoy the others company, although no real animosity

exists between the races.

CATFOLK CHARACTERS

Agile and charismatic, catfolk characters make excellent

rogues and rangers.

Adventuring  Catfolk:  Adventuring  catfolk  feel  the

restlessness common to their people more acutely than most.

The thrill of discovery and a great sense of curiosity drive

these adventurers to break from their tribes and wander other

lands. Beyond simple wanderlust, some catfolk  nd the heat

of  combat  exhilarating,  and  the  rush  of  danger  draws  the

catfolk adventurer ever onward.

Catfolk  admire  adventurers  and  see  accomplished

adventurers as great assets to the tribe. The nomadic life

of  the  catfolk  is  fraught  with  danger  and  unexpected

encounters, and the life of the typical catfolk is more akin

to that of an adventurer than the life of a typical human

or elf.

Female catfolk

Male catfolk

Character Development: Catfolk should select feats

and skills that take advantage of their high Dexterity or

mitigate the drawbacks of their +1 level adjustment. The

easiest way to do this is through ranged combatit turns

the catfolks high Dexterity into a bonus on attack rolls

and  keeps  the  monsters  at  a  distance,  minimizing  the

catfolks lack of a Hit Die relative to other characters of

the same ECL.

Character Names: Catfolk favor names that begin with

D, M, or N and contain multiple s and r sounds. A

catfolk clan name translates into Common as a participle

(a verb made into an adjective by adding -ing) followed by

a noun.

Male Names: Densharr, Mersharr, Nermissar, Therrass.

Female  Names:  Dessirris,  Mianissa,  Morasha,  Nera,

Thessana.

Clan Names: Flying Eagle, Hunting Tiger, Running Brook,

Screaming Arrow.

ROLEPLAYING A CATFOLK

Catfolk respond to the varied experiences of life with passion

and emotional intensity. They accomplish as much in their

quick but short-lived bursts of activity or emotion as other

races do at their relatively plodding pace. Catfolk relish both

the heated ferocity of battle and the warmth of a quiet meal

with trusted companions.

Personality: Catfolk share a quick and engaging con-

 dence that makes them seem always ready for the next

challenge. Quick to anger and just as quick to forgive, catfolk

live a life  lled with emotion. Members of most races  nd

catfolk pleasant company despite their mercurial tempera-

ment, nding their free-owing emotion and enjoyment

of life refreshing and captivating. The emotional catfolk

have a darker, dangerous side as well, and they are as likely

to meet an insult with a drawn weapon as they are to shrug

it off with a jest.

Roleplaying  Application:  Let  your  emotions  come  to  the

surface at every opportunity. When you form an opinion,

express it. React passionately to most encounters, drawing

weapons when a ght is eminent and offering welcome to

those  who  seem  friendly.  Dont  be  shy  about  criticizing

the things you dont like. Dont be stingy with praise for

those things you enjoy.

Behavior: Catfolk move in quick bursts of speed rather

than in one steady gait. Even when covering long distances,

they  intersperse  short  dashes  with  short  periods  of  rest.

Members of other races nd this style of movement almost

impossible to emulate, but to catfolk its much less tiring than

simply trudging on at a steady pace.

Catfolk also place great importance on small tokens that

serve as physical connections to their memories, and they

view these special tokens as having physiological importance

if not true magical power. Adult catfolk carry several such

tokens with them at all times, ranging from objects as large

as  weapons  and  armor  that  served  well  in  past  battles  to

items as subtle as a small brooch that the character wore on

an important day in the past. For catfolk, this tradition is a

deeply personal experience, and the highest compliment a

catfolk can pay someone is to present one of his tokens as a

gift and explain its signicance.

Roleplaying  Application:  If  you  use  miniatures  while

exploring  a  dungeon,  you  can  represent  your  actions

visually by moving a short distance ahead each time the

group clusters or falling behind a bit as the group moves

on and then catching up in a burst of speed. If you dont

use miniatures, or if you only use them during combat,

emphasize the way you move by describing your move-

ments as jumping or dashing rather than walking. Take

the time to be clear about your characters position relative

to the rest of the party.

You should pick a minor token that has special meaning

to  you  at  least  once  a  level.  Although  these  tokens  may

sometimes  be  weapons  or  items  that  helped  you  or  your

companions through a trying battle, most should be simple

items that others would never suspect hold such meaning. As

a sign of great respect and friendship, you can present one of

these items to another character or to an NPC, but you should

do this at most every few levels. Such tokens might include

the dagger a friend gave you a long time ago, the etching

from the arrow that killed the rst game animal you took

down,  or  a  well-worn  bowl  that  your  grandfather  carried

with him on his adventures.

Language: Catfolk have their own language, which they

use primarily for conversation with other members of their

race. Regardless of whether they communicate in Feline,

Common,  or  some  other  language,  catfolk  express  their

opinions quickly and expect others to do the same. Catfolk

can  listen  to  others  patiently  enough,  but  once  they  have

expressed a clear opinion, they expect the conversation to

come to a conclusion quickly. They have little time for those

who attempt to persuade or debate by simply restating their

opinion. They grow bored when others take a long time to

reach a point or who view an exchange of opinions as a trial

of endurance.

Roleplaying Application: Dont debatetake the time to

listen to others and then express your opinion or view.

Only express your opinion once, but dont be abrupt or

blunt. Maintain an open attitude toward the thoughts of

others. Express your emotions openly in conversations,

magnifying most responses to represent greater heights

of emotion.

Evasion (Ex): If a catfolk inltrator is exposed to any

effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reex saving

throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This catfolk inltrator deals an extra

2d6 points of damage on any successful attack against at-

footed or anked targets, or against a target that has been

denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical  hits  are  all  immune  to  sneak  attacks.  A  catfolk

inltrator may choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her

sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that

purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Trapnding (Ex): A catfolk inltrator can nd, disarm,

or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the

Search skill to nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm,

magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it).

If her Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or

more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering

or disarming it.

Possessions: +1 studded leather, masterwork buckler, master-

work rapier, masterwork composite shortbow (+2 Str bonus)

with 20 arrows, 5 silvered arrows, 5 cold iron arrows, cloak of

resistance +1, potion of cure moderate wounds.

CATFOLK ADVENTURES

Adventures featuring catfolk are likely to focus on problems

that the catfolk encounter while wandering the plains. The

catfolk discover or confront any number of hazards through

their  nomadic  lifestyle,  and  occasionally  they  require  the

help of adventurers to deal with them.

While  wandering,  the  Running  Brook  tribe  discovered

the  ruins  of  an  ancient  citadel  that  long  ago  fell  into  a

deep chasm. The ruined citadel is apparently dedicated to

a dragon or a draconic cult, but the catfolk quickly moved

from the area and know little else about the site.

Samass-Sarral, a great circle of magical stones that many

catfolk tribes regard as holy, has been recently plagued by

undead. The time of an ancient rite nears, and the catfolk

must clear the site of undead before the new moon.

Swift and sure, that is the way of the centaur.

CENTAUR

Abryxius Bruile, centaur courser

Far stronger and faster than other humanoid races, centaurs

rule huge swathes of the wild. They build peaceful, idyllic

communities, hunting what and where they wish.

Centaurs inhabit the plains and forests in tribes of varying

size.  Even  though  they  build  permanent  shelters  and  live

in one place for many years at a time, centaurs roam from

their homes on a regular basis, ranging over great distances

in relatively short amounts of time.  Centaurs regard such

excursions as essential to understanding the world around

their homes, and they greatly enjoy such activity for its own

sake. Although their crafts have not reached the level of some

of the humanoid races, it is only because centaurs prefer to

venture from their homes often rather than to stay in one

place and ply a single trade.

CENTAUR RACIAL TRAITS

With the lower body of a large horse and the upper torso

and arms of a human, centaurs combine speed and strength

in their powerful forms. A centaur is as big and heavy as a

horse, standing about 7 feet high and weighing about 2,100

pounds.  Brown  dominates  most  of  a  centaurs  coloring,

the long hair on the top of the head and the glossy fur of

the horselike body ranging from a light tan to a deep, dark

brown. A centaurs humanlike torso has a swarthy, earthy

complexion.  In  some  isolated  tribes  and  rare  individuals,

other colorings emerge, such as white, gray, or black, but

these are extremely uncommon.

+8 Strength, +4 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, 2 Intelligence,

+2 Wisdom.

Large size: 1 penalty to Armor Class, 1 penalty on

attack rolls, 4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on

grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits double those

of Medium characters.

Space/Reach: 10 feet/5 feet.

A centaurs base land speed is 50 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Racial  Hit  Dice:  A  centaur  begins  with  four  levels  of

monstrous humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice; a base

attack bonus of +4; and base saving throw bonuses of Fort

+1, Ref +4, and Will +4.

Racial Skills: A centaurs monstrous humanoid levels give

him skill points equal to 7  (2 + Int modier). His class

skills are Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival.

Racial Feats: A centaurs monstrous humanoid levels give

him two feats.

+3 natural armor bonus.

Automatic  Languages:  Sylvan,  Elven.  Bonus  Languages:

Common, Gnome, Haling.

Favored Class: Ranger. Centaur rangers often choose

magical  beasts  or  some  variety  of  humanoid  as  their

favored enemy.

Level adjustment +2.

CENTAUR SOCIETY

The  tribal  society  of  the  centaurs  regards  freedom  and

personal  choice  as  the  highest  virtues.  As  long  as  an

individuals choices do not hinder the welfare of another

centaur  of  the  tribe,  these  peaceful  creatures  leave  all

decisions in the hands of the individual. The seemingly

unorganized society of the centaurs is actually bound by

an openness and camaraderie that more civilized cultures

have long since lost.

CENTAUR SOCIETY

The  tribal  society  of  the  centaurs  regards  freedom  and

personal  choice  as  the  highest  virtues.  As  long  as  an

individuals choices do not hinder the welfare of another

centaur  of  the  tribe,  these  peaceful  creatures  leave  all

decisions in the hands of the individual. The seemingly

unorganized society of the centaurs is actually bound by

an openness and camaraderie that more civilized cultures

have long since lost.

Lands: Centaurs make their lairs in forested areas and

prefer  to  range  through  temperate  plains  and  forests.

Although centaurs have permanent dwellings, their culture

has more in common with nomads and hunters than with

the  city-building  races  of  humanoids.  Like  nomadic  cul-

tures, centaur tribes range farther north during the warm

months  and  concentrate  in  southern  temperate  regions

during the winter.

Settlements: Centaur lairs look little like the perma-

nent  structures  of  other  races,  consisting  of  a  series  of

beautiful forest glades, peaceful streams,

and  perhaps  a  few  scattered  lean-tos.

Although  these  lairs  seem  simple  and

unprotected, they provide

more  protection  than

even the stoutest walls

by  allowing  the  swift-

moving centaurs to encircle

approaching foes or easily ee if

pressed too hard.

Power Groups: A centaur

druid is usually a tribes

designated leader and

speaker, but groups of

centaur warriors hold

great sway in any given

tribe, mainly because

their  choices  of

where  and  what

to  hunt  greatly

impact  how  well

the tribe will eat in

the  coming  weeks.

These  hunters,  brave

and  free-spirited  as  they

are, have their passions

tempered by the wisdom

of  the  centaur  druids

who study the wilderness through which the tribe roams.

Although  these  groups  rarely  have  lasting  conicts,  the

hunters and druids often wish to pursue differing short-

term goals.

Beliefs:  Centaurs  love  and  worship  nature,  and  most

who wish to devote themselves to a higher power or cause

become  druids.  Nearly  all  centaur  clerics  (who  are  rare)

worship the centaur deity Skerrit. Clerics of this nature de-

ity can choose any two of the following domains: Animal,

Good, or Plant.

Relations: Centaurs shun humans. Although they bear

them no serious ire, they prefer open lands to the closed-

in cities that humans invariably build. Centaurs get along

well  with  elves  and  with  many  of  the  wandering  races,

such as catfolk and halings. Centaurs have had too many

dangerous  skirmishes  against  tribes  of  vicious  gnolls  to

be anything other than suspicious of the hyena-headed

humanoids,  but  they  are  open-minded  and  intelligent

Male centaur

enough to get along with an individual gnoll that proves

itself trustworthy.

CENTAUR CHARACTERS

Because  of  their  unique  physical  abilities  and  physiology,

centaurs make versatile warriors and scouts. Centaurs who

take a few levels in druid or (more rarely) cleric combine

powerful  ranged  attacks  with  minor  spellcasting  abilities

much like a multiclass humanoid spellcaster does.

Adventuring Centaurs: Centaur adventurers dont have

the problems with outsiders that most centaurs do. Through

a combination of condence, curiosity, and ambi-

tion, these brave centaurs have come to view

the cities and communities of other cultures

as places to learn and explore rather than

places to avoid.

Centaurs view adventurers as

cultural outsiders. Many other

races of the wild, such as

gnolls and catfolk, see

only  a  small  dif-

ference  between

an  accomplished

hunter who provides food for the

tribe  and  an  adventurer,  but

centaurs feel quite different-

ly. Although centaurs do not

shun  adventurers  of  their

own race in the same way

that  they  shun  humans,

orcs,  and  some  other

humanoids,  they  never

make  centaur  adventurers

feel truly welcome, and usu-

ally  encourage  such  a  character

to  move  on  to  another  area  or

community  after  a  short  time

among them.

Female centaur

Character Development: Centaur characters have 4 racial

Hit Dice and a +2 level adjustment. As a result, many of a

centaurs early choices are simplied. In the early stages of

their careers, centaur characters often have fewer hit points

than  other  humanoid  warriors  of  an  equal  level,  causing

many centaurs to favor ranged combat. Mastering the use of

a powerful composite longbow allows a  centaur character

to take advantage of his strength, and his high speed allows

him to keep his distance from most foes. For melee combat,

centaurs prefer two-handed weapons that allow them to take

full  advantage  of  their  high  strength,  such  as  longspears,

greatswords, and greataxes.

When playing a centaur, remember that the races unique

anatomy  causes  problems  in  certain  circumstances.  In

a four-member party, its quite likely that if the centaur

character falls in combat, the party will lack the physical

strength to move him. In addition, as pointed out on page

7  of  the  Monster  Manual,  some  creatures  simply  arent

made  for  certain  types  of  physical  activity.  Centaurs,

despite their great strength, are not capable of climbing

sheer surfaces, nor do they have much chance of walking

a tightrope. In these situations, the DM is the final arbiter

of in-game logic.

Character Names: Centaur given names are multisyllabic

and commonly include the letters z, x, r, and y. Centaur

family names usually have only one syllable. Centaurs use a

single given name and a family name.

ROLEPLAYING A CENTAUR

The  most  striking  difference  between  centaurs  and

humanoid  characters  is  obviously  their  physiology,  but

there are interesting differences in their outlooks as well.

Centaurs cover great distances easily, and therefore  they

have less attachment to places and possessions than many

humanoid races.

Personality: Most centaurs tend to be easygoing, almost

mild-mannered; they are usually uninterested in interacting

with members of the humanoid races. Centaur adventurers,

however, have an innate curiosity that overcomes the typical

centaur hesitation to interact with others, and they are gener-

ally friendly and outgoing. Even so, centaur adventurers tend

to prefer halings and elves over adventuring companions

of other races.

As thinking, civilized creatures, centaurs frown upon

those humanoids who look on them as potential mounts.

It is a grave insult to ask a centaur to serve as a mount, and

centaurs usually offer to carry their companions only in

dire circumstances.

Roleplaying  Application:  You  should  roleplay  the  tension

between your own curiosity and the stereotypes that your

people  hold  toward  members  of  other  races.  When  you

interact with a member of another race, try to convey that

you have preconceptions about the character but that you are

trying to keep an open mind.

Serving as a mount is beneath you. Only when the life

of a close companion is at risk should you deign to carry

a humanoid.

Behaviors: Centaur adventurers know that they can expect

a cold welcome should they attempt to return to their homes,

and  for  that  reason  many  view  themselves  as  permanent

wanderers. This attitude is greatly comforting, rather than

conning, to the swift-moving centaur adventurer. Because

of this mind-set, however, such characters seldom own more

than they can carry on their broad backs.

In combat, centaurs see running as the natural approach to

beginning a battle, using their speed to establish a comfort-

able range before the ghting begins.

Roleplaying  Application:  Use  your  increased  carrying

capacity to be ready for any situation. You are comfortable

making your home nearly anywhere, but you do not expect

to  stay  in  one  place  for  long.  You  might  seek  to  collect

tokens or mementos from the exotic places that you visit,

filling your backpacks with these items in the same way

that a human might line his mantle with mementos of his

own travels.

In combat, you should encourage your companions to ght

like centaurs, even to the point of urging them to learn feats

such as Spring Attack and Shot on the Run.

Language: Most centaurs are slow to share their thoughts

with others, but this reticence seldom hinders their social

skills.  When  communicating  with  most  humanoids,

centaurs  keep  their  statements  short  and  to  the  point;

they are more comfortable and outgoing around halflings

and elves.

Roleplaying Application: Although you are neither shy nor

intimidated by others, consider your thoughts carefully

before sharing them. One carefully worded statement is better

than a long, ill-advised discourse. Two favored centaur battle

cries are Swift! and Run fast, run sure! Try to differenti-

ate the way you talk to most humanoids from the way you

interact with halings, elves, and your trusted friends. There

should be a marked difference between the ways you interact

with these two groups.

CENTAUR ENCOUNTERS

Centaurs love running battles. The centaur courser described

here  makes  an  effective  leader  for  a  patrolling  group  of

centaurs, especially when they are able to use their preferred

tactic during a ght.

EL 7: Four centaurs make up an EL 7 patrol group. The

canny  creatures  move  with  more  stealth  than  their  large

forms would indicate, and they are quite capable of destroying

even a more powerful party in a running combat if their foes

lack the speed to catch them.

EL 10: Centaur courser and four centaurs. This patrol

group is led by a seasoned centaur barbarian leader, giving the

group the ability to take on larger, more powerful monsters.

Typically, the centaurs will all try to ght from long range,

making one attack with their bows and then moving further

away from their foes. When facing enemies able to keep pace

with this tactic, the centaurs attempt to move around the

enemy and provide anking opportunities for the centaur

coursers attacks.

CENTAUR ADVENTURES

Centaurs  often  shun  outsiders,  and  therefore  adventur-

ers  may  find  themselves  unwelcome  and  unwanted  in

centaur lands. In the rare situations where centaurs find

themselves unable to flee from a more powerful foe, they

have turned to adventurers for assistance. In addition to

these extremely rare situations, centaurs have been known

to overcome their distaste for the company of other races

long enough to help a group of adventurers locate some

monster or foe that threatens their lands. By guiding the

adventurers in this way, centaurs usually  minimize the

time that the adventurers spend within their lands and

make  it  more  likely  that  the  adventurers  will  inadver-

tently aid them by driving off or at least weakening one

of their foes.

leave in peace, but their speed and ability with the bow

make  them  condent  that  they  can  defend  the  forest

from any human incursion. Adventurers must succeed at

the difcult task of persuading the centaurs, who clearly

have the upper hand in the growing conict, to leave or

coexist peacefully with the human communitya dif-

cult task considering the centaurs reluctance to interact

with outsiders.

Centaurs have long avoided the heart of the great forest

through which they roam. Dangerous poisonous gases,

unusual patches of magical darkness, and other strange

features in the forests center make it hazardous even to

the swift centaurs. When this terrible region begins to

expand through the forest, the centaurs suspect a green

dragon lurks deep within the wood, and they finally

decide to seek powerful adventurers to help rid them

of the menace.

CENTAUR MONSTER CLASS

Monstrous Humanoid

Proud and noble beings with the strength and speed of

horses and a fondness for archery, centaurs are guardians

of  the  forest.  Centaur  tribes  trade  with  many  elf  com-

munities, and each agrees to protect the other in times of

need. It is under agreements such as these that centaurs

may be found traveling with bands of elves, lending their

muscles  and  hooves  to  defend  against  evil  creatures

and despoilers.

The centaur is a strong class suitable for any player who

enjoys nature-oriented characters. It has few special abilities

and reasonable ability score modiers, making a centaur

character more than capable of holding his own in a ght

compared to barbarians, ghters, and rangers. Over the levels

of this class, a centaurs Strength and Constitution increase

to an impressive level, he becomes faster and larger, and he

deals more damage with his great hooves.

Racial Traits

A tribe of centaurs seems to menace a human community.

Although the centaurs have not yet resorted to violence,

they have clearly discouraged the humans from taking

lumber  from  the  nearby  forest.  Despite  having  only

recently  moved  to  the  area,  the  centaurs  consider  the

forest to be their territory and tolerate no interference

from the humans. Rather than moving on, the centaurs

have decided to drive the humans away. They dont wish

GNOLL

The cruelty of our past has made us strong. Now we must prove

we can also be just.

Garnock Truefeather, gnoll druid of Obad-Hai

While  most  of  their  people  remain  mired  in  the  cruelty

of  their  demon  prince,  a  few  tribes  of  gnolls  seek  to  pull

themselves out of savagery. These tribes walk with weapons

in hand, knowing that the civilized races hate and fear their

people and that other tribes of evil gnolls already seek to

strike them down.

Fueled by their own bestial strength and the cruel will

of the demon prince Yeenoghu, most gnolls roam the wild

in  search  of  sentient  prey.  These  savages  know  little  of

mercy and honor, and nothing of kindness or compassion.

The exceptions to this rule, who have banded together in

rough tribes that roam the plains and forests, have begun

to learn the value of personal honor. Some even approach

the harsh but ultimately fair codes that tribes of barbaric

humans often adopt. Geared more toward survival than the

cruelty of their kin, these gnolls stand at a critical juncture:

Either they will succeed in allying with the civilized races

and pull some of their people away from the cruel worship

of Yeenoghuor they will fail, and their tribes will slip

back into evil and brutality.

GNOLL RACIAL TRAITS

Gnolls have hyenalike heads, and their long limbs possess

a lean strength. Gnolls are covered in coarse yellow or red-

dish-brown fur, and their feet and legs are structured more

like a hyenas hind legs than those of other humanoids.

Despite the somewhat awkward appearance of their legs and

feet, gnolls walk as bipeds and are as agile and speedy as a

normal human. The wild gnolls who prey on the civilized

races use patchwork armor and rusted weapons that theyve

stolen from past kills. Tribes that have found some level of

personal honor favor hide or leather armor similar to the

barbarian tribes of humans.

Gnoll characters possess the following racial traits:

Strength +4, Constitution +2, Intelligence 2, Charisma 2.

Medium size.

A gnolls base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Racial Hit Dice: A gnoll begins with two levels of human-

oid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice; a base attack bonus of

+1; and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and

Will +0.

Racial Skills: A gnolls humanoid levels give him skill

points equal to 5  (2 + Int modier). His class skills are

Listen and Spot.

Racial Feats: A gnolls humanoid levels give him one feat.

Automatic Language: Gnoll. Bonus Languages: Common,

Draconic, Elven, Goblin, Orc.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Level adjustment +1.

GNOLL SOCIETY

Most  gnoll  tribes  wander  the  wilderness,  the  strongest

warrior governing with a brutal adherence to the idea that

the strong can freely take from the weak. A few gnoll tribes

attempt to pull away from their savage past, but they are the

rare exception rather than the rule.

Lands:  Driven  into  the  mountain  foothills  and  deep

forests  by  the  armies  of  human  nations  and  their  allies,

gnolls  live  in  scattered  wilderness  areas  much  like  those

preferred by tribes of barbaric humans. Competing against

humans, orcs, giants, and more exotic species is the norm for

gnolls in these wilderness areas, and the gnolls occasionally

form  alliances  with  other  evil  humanoids.  In  rare  cases,

large groups of gnolls gather above or below ground. These

settlements  serve  only  as  a  common  crossroads  for  more

CENTAUR ADVENTURES

Centaurs  often  shun  outsiders,  and  therefore  adventur-

ers  may  find  themselves  unwelcome  and  unwanted  in

centaur lands. In the rare situations where centaurs find

themselves unable to flee from a more powerful foe, they

have turned to adventurers for assistance. In addition to

these extremely rare situations, centaurs have been known

to overcome their distaste for the company of other races

long enough to help a group of adventurers locate some

monster or foe that threatens their lands. By guiding the

adventurers in this way, centaurs usually  minimize the

time that the adventurers spend within their lands and

make  it  more  likely  that  the  adventurers  will  inadver-

tently aid them by driving off or at least weakening one

of their foes.

leave in peace, but their speed and ability with the bow

make  them  condent  that  they  can  defend  the  forest

from any human incursion. Adventurers must succeed at

the difcult task of persuading the centaurs, who clearly

have the upper hand in the growing conict, to leave or

coexist peacefully with the human communitya dif-

cult task considering the centaurs reluctance to interact

with outsiders.

Centaurs have long avoided the heart of the great forest

through which they roam. Dangerous poisonous gases,

unusual patches of magical darkness, and other strange

features in the forests center make it hazardous even to

the swift centaurs. When this terrible region begins to

expand through the forest, the centaurs suspect a green

dragon lurks deep within the wood, and they finally

decide to seek powerful adventurers to help rid them

of the menace.

CENTAUR MONSTER CLASS

Monstrous Humanoid

Proud and noble beings with the strength and speed of

horses and a fondness for archery, centaurs are guardians

of  the  forest.  Centaur  tribes  trade  with  many  elf  com-

munities, and each agrees to protect the other in times of

need. It is under agreements such as these that centaurs

may be found traveling with bands of elves, lending their

muscles  and  hooves  to  defend  against  evil  creatures

and despoilers.

The centaur is a strong class suitable for any player who

enjoys nature-oriented characters. It has few special abilities

and reasonable ability score modiers, making a centaur

character more than capable of holding his own in a ght

compared to barbarians, ghters, and rangers. Over the levels

of this class, a centaurs Strength and Constitution increase

to an impressive level, he becomes faster and larger, and he

deals more damage with his great hooves.

Racial Traits

A tribe of centaurs seems to menace a human community.

Although the centaurs have not yet resorted to violence,

they have clearly discouraged the humans from taking

lumber  from  the  nearby  forest.  Despite  having  only

recently  moved  to  the  area,  the  centaurs  consider  the

forest to be their territory and tolerate no interference

from the humans. Rather than moving on, the centaurs

have decided to drive the humans away. They dont wish

to resort to violence and would prefer that the humans

attempt to pull away from their savage past, but they are the

nomadic gnollsthose who leave to continue wandering

are balanced against new tribes arriving to trade or swear

fealty to a powerful leader.

As some gnolls turn away from the worship of the dread

prince Yeenoghu, however, gnolls grow more and more

scattered  rather  than  less  so.  Driven  away  from  their  kin

by the wrath of Yeenoghus priests, yet still subject to the

suspicions of the civilized races, these gnolls wander far and

wide in a near-permanent nomadic state.

Settlements: Gnoll settlements are rough and crude,

rarely anything more than temporary shelters. Gnolls prefer

underground lairs for longer stays, especially when a travel-

ing group of gnolls must await new births. Large groups of

gnolls often have several crude underground complexes

between which they wander. While these caves might not

even be large enough to house the entire group of gnolls,

they provide the groups strongest warriors a place to sleep

in relative safety. Weaker members of the tribe must make

do with the less trustworthy shelters they can set up outside

of the cave complex.

Power Groups: Gnolls have little in the way of power

groups. Among tribes of evil gnolls, the strongest warriors

rule by brute force. Occasionally, exceptionally powerful or

persuasive priests of Yeenoghu will lead a tribe, usually by

ensuring that the strongest warriors are devoted to the dark

worship of the demon prince. Even those rare gnoll tribes

that place a greater value on personal honor are led by the

most physically powerful warrior. Because of this, when

a  gnoll  adventures  with  members  of  other  races,  he  will

sometimes expect to lead if he is the strongest, regardless of

the difculties he faces when traveling within the members

of other races and regardless of other group members more

developed social skills.

Beliefs: Most gnolls pay homage to Yeenoghu, demon

prince of gnolls. Yeenoghus cruel and selsh beliefs inspire

gnoll priests to keep their people rmly on the path of evil.

Those few gnolls who have managed to pull away from the

dark cult at the center of their peoples existence often revere

Obad-Hai or turn away from religion altogether.

Relations: Few races regard gnolls as anything other than

feral creatures who pose a menace to peaceful life. Because of

the prevalence of evil gnolls, this assumption isnt far from

the truth, and player character gnolls should nd it difcult

to move unescorted through a human city.

GNOLL CHARACTERS

Gnoll characters balance the challenges of roleplaying con-

trary to a races normal image with the novelty of playing

a monstrous race. The gnoll race provides an opportunity

to  play  a  strong  and  powerful  warrior  character  strug-

gling not only against physical foes but also against the

opinions of other races. As a gnoll character grows to trust

his  fellow  adventurers,  new  roleplaying  opportunities

arise as bonds of friendship overcome suspicion, and the

other characters grow to respect the gnolls values as well

as his physical abilities. The other PCs might even play a

role  in  helping  the  gnoll  characters  tribe  of  neutral  or

honorable gnolls build the first few trusting relationships

with other races.

Adventuring Gnolls: Gnolls adventure to see the world,

to rise above the savagery of their people, and to nd what

civilization has to offer. While some return to their tribes

thinking less of the civilized races because of their experi-

ences as adventurers, others nd wealth, power, or prestige

far beyond the normal images of gnoll warriors.

Character  Development:  Gnolls  are  most  effective

when  they  take  levels  in  barbarian,  ranger,  or  another

martially focused class. Focusing on melee combat allows

gnoll characters to capitalize on their high Strength scores

and their natural armor. As your character gains levels,

feats such as Power Attack and Cleave help accentuate his

physical prowess.

Character  Names:  Gnoll  names  often  sound  like

growls to members of other races, featuring multiple r

sounds. Gnoll tribal names, although not widely shared

with other creatures, are usually compound words, as in

the following examples.

Male Names: Derror, Grerr, Remmar, Thurrg.

Female Names: Arrna, Mirrin, Ryssa, Thrrae.

Tribal  Names:  Bloodfist,  Greatfang,  Speardeath,

Thunderdance.

ROLEPLAYING A GNOLL

Cruelty  and  viciousness  remain  the  defining  traits  of

most  gnolls,  but  a  few  tribes  have  managed  to  pull

away from this bestial outlook and the worship of the

demon prince Yeenoghu that usually accompanies and

engenders  this  behavior.  Although  far  from  altruistic,

these gnolls temper the viciousness of their kind with a

rough sense of honor and an unwavering bond with their

chosen companions.

Personality: Even those gnolls who have turned from

the  evil  ways  of  their  demon  prince  are  less  intelligent

and less charismatic than the average human. Gnolls dont

see this deficiency as a weakness, however, placing more

value on physical abilities and natural cunning than on

subtle thought or persuasive abilities. Gnolls also remain

very suspicious of other races, especially humans and their

allies, with whom they have had generations of conflict

and strife.

Roleplaying Application: You should be suspicious of others

motives until they give you reason to trust them. If you can,

devote a few skill points to Sense Motive, and emphasize

its use in roleplaying encounters. Your suspicions rest on

the rm foundation of your peoples long conicts with

the civilized races, and such mistrust and conict cannot

be erased easily or quickly. Humans, elves, dwarves, and

members  of  their  allied  races  are  likely  to  use  the  past

behavior of your people as a reason to betray you. After

someone earns your trust completely, however, he or she

becomes like a brother or sister to you, and the few powerful

emotional bonds that you form with others shape your life

and your outlook. Once you name someone a packbrother,

he forever has your trust.

Behavior: Gnolls are travelers, hunters, and scavengers;

adventuring gnolls travel almost constantly. To a gnoll,

sitting in one place isnt cowardly or illogical; its simply

unpleasant. Some gnolls are drawn simply by the thrill

and variety of the hunt, while others are motivated only by

curiosity. As a pack of gnolls grows, the bond of the pack

serves as a major impetus for travelthe most

adventurous gnolls pull the rest of the pack

along on their hunts. Packs of evil gnolls are

driven to travel by the will of their demon

prince,  and  packs  of  neutral  gnolls

travel to escape the inuence of other

gnoll packs and the wariness

of  human  cities  accustomed

to ghting off their cruel and

evil kin.

Roleplaying  Application:  You

should  often  urge  your  ad-

venturing companions to

contemplate  long,  over-

land journeys. In light

of this, make sure that

you can carry everything

you  own.  If  you  cant  carry

something with you personal-

ly, make sure you have a trusted

mount  or  beast  of  burden  to

carry it for you. In general, a few

high-quality  possessions

are much more valuable

to  you  than  numerous

goods  or  more  visible

wealth. You might empha-

size your love of travel by

encouraging  your  group

to stay outdoors rather

than at an inn. Focus

on adventuring oppor-

tunities that will take you on long journeys rather than those

in your immediate area.

Language:  Gnolls  who  travel  beyond  the  homeland  of

their tribes usually try to adopt the speaking habits of those

around them, hoping to lessen other humanoids sense of

discomfort  around  them.  Around  their  own  kind,  gnolls

use their racial tongue and usually speak in the imperative,

considering it polite to show strength by phrasing statements

as commands rather than requests.

Roleplaying Application: It is a sign of weakness to ask for

things, so dont do it often. You understand that others dont

speak in commands the way your people do, but sometimes

you slip into old habits. Those who ask too often or who

phrase everything as a question are unworthy of respect,

for they are weak.

GNOLL ADVENTURES

must often stop their depredations. Adventures featuring

neutral gnolls, however, pose much greater challenges and

might force characters to reevaluate their own beliefs and

by the wrath of Yeenoghus priests, yet still subject to the

suspicions of the civilized races, these gnolls wander far and

wide in a near-permanent nomadic state.

Settlements: Gnoll settlements are rough and crude,

rarely anything more than temporary shelters. Gnolls prefer

underground lairs for longer stays, especially when a travel-

ing group of gnolls must await new births. Large groups of

gnolls often have several crude underground complexes

between which they wander. While these caves might not

even be large enough to house the entire group of gnolls,

they provide the groups strongest warriors a place to sleep

in relative safety. Weaker members of the tribe must make

do with the less trustworthy shelters they can set up outside

of the cave complex.

Power Groups: Gnolls have little in the way of power

groups. Among tribes of evil gnolls, the strongest warriors

rule by brute force. Occasionally, exceptionally powerful or

persuasive priests of Yeenoghu will lead a tribe, usually by

ensuring that the strongest warriors are devoted to the dark

worship of the demon prince. Even those rare gnoll tribes

that place a greater value on personal honor are led by the

most physically powerful warrior. Because of this, when

a  gnoll  adventures  with  members  of  other  races,  he  will

sometimes expect to lead if he is the strongest, regardless of

the difculties he faces when traveling within the members

of other races and regardless of other group members more

developed social skills.

Beliefs: Most gnolls pay homage to Yeenoghu, demon

prince of gnolls. Yeenoghus cruel and selsh beliefs inspire

gnoll priests to keep their people rmly on the path of evil.

Those few gnolls who have managed to pull away from the

dark cult at the center of their peoples existence often revere

Obad-Hai or turn away from religion altogether.

Relations: Few races regard gnolls as anything other than

feral creatures who pose a menace to peaceful life. Because of

the prevalence of evil gnolls, this assumption isnt far from

the truth, and player character gnolls should nd it difcult

to move unescorted through a human city.

GNOLL CHARACTERS

Gnoll characters balance the challenges of roleplaying con-

trary to a races normal image with the novelty of playing

a monstrous race. The gnoll race provides an opportunity

to  play  a  strong  and  powerful  warrior  character  strug-

gling not only against physical foes but also against the

opinions of other races. As a gnoll character grows to trust

his  fellow  adventurers,  new  roleplaying  opportunities

arise as bonds of friendship overcome suspicion, and the

other characters grow to respect the gnolls values as well

as his physical abilities. The other PCs might even play a

role  in  helping  the  gnoll  characters  tribe  of  neutral  or

honorable gnolls build the first few trusting relationships

with other races.

Adventuring Gnolls: Gnolls adventure to see the world,

to rise above the savagery of their people, and to nd what

civilization has to offer. While some return to their tribes

thinking less of the civilized races because of their experi-

ences as adventurers, others nd wealth, power, or prestige

far beyond the normal images of gnoll warriors.

Character  Development:  Gnolls  are  most  effective

when  they  take  levels  in  barbarian,  ranger,  or  another

martially focused class. Focusing on melee combat allows

gnoll characters to capitalize on their high Strength scores

and their natural armor. As your character gains levels,

feats such as Power Attack and Cleave help accentuate his

physical prowess.

Character  Names:  Gnoll  names  often  sound  like

growls to members of other races, featuring multiple r

sounds. Gnoll tribal names, although not widely shared

with other creatures, are usually compound words, as in

the following examples.

Male Names: Derror, Grerr, Remmar, Thurrg.

Female Names: Arrna, Mirrin, Ryssa, Thrrae.

Tribal  Names:  Bloodfist,  Greatfang,  Speardeath,

Thunderdance.

ROLEPLAYING A GNOLL

Cruelty  and  viciousness  remain  the  defining  traits  of

most  gnolls,  but  a  few  tribes  have  managed  to  pull

away from this bestial outlook and the worship of the

demon prince Yeenoghu that usually accompanies and

engenders  this  behavior.  Although  far  from  altruistic,

these gnolls temper the viciousness of their kind with a

rough sense of honor and an unwavering bond with their

chosen companions.

Personality: Even those gnolls who have turned from

the  evil  ways  of  their  demon  prince  are  less  intelligent

and less charismatic than the average human. Gnolls dont

see this deficiency as a weakness, however, placing more

value on physical abilities and natural cunning than on

subtle thought or persuasive abilities. Gnolls also remain

very suspicious of other races, especially humans and their

allies, with whom they have had generations of conflict

and strife.

Roleplaying Application: You should be suspicious of others

motives until they give you reason to trust them. If you can,

devote a few skill points to Sense Motive, and emphasize

its use in roleplaying encounters. Your suspicions rest on

the rm foundation of your peoples long conicts with

the civilized races, and such mistrust and conict cannot

be erased easily or quickly. Humans, elves, dwarves, and

members  of  their  allied  races  are  likely  to  use  the  past

behavior of your people as a reason to betray you. After

someone earns your trust completely, however, he or she

becomes like a brother or sister to you, and the few powerful

emotional bonds that you form with others shape your life

and your outlook. Once you name someone a packbrother,

he forever has your trust.

Behavior: Gnolls are travelers, hunters, and scavengers;

adventuring gnolls travel almost constantly. To a gnoll,

sitting in one place isnt cowardly or illogical; its simply

unpleasant. Some gnolls are drawn simply by the thrill

and variety of the hunt, while others are motivated only by

curiosity. As a pack of gnolls grows, the bond of the pack

serves as a major impetus for travelthe most

adventurous gnolls pull the rest of the pack

along on their hunts. Packs of evil gnolls are

driven to travel by the will of their demon

prince,  and  packs  of  neutral  gnolls

travel to escape the inuence of other

gnoll packs and the wariness

of  human  cities  accustomed

to ghting off their cruel and

evil kin.

Roleplaying  Application:  You

should  often  urge  your  ad-

venturing companions to

contemplate  long,  over-

land journeys. In light

of this, make sure that

you can carry everything

you  own.  If  you  cant  carry

something with you personal-

ly, make sure you have a trusted

mount  or  beast  of  burden  to

carry it for you. In general, a few

high-quality  possessions

are much more valuable

to  you  than  numerous

goods  or  more  visible

wealth. You might empha-

size your love of travel by

encouraging  your  group

to stay outdoors rather

than at an inn. Focus

on adventuring oppor-

tunities that will take you on long journeys rather than those

in your immediate area.

Language:  Gnolls  who  travel  beyond  the  homeland  of

their tribes usually try to adopt the speaking habits of those

around them, hoping to lessen other humanoids sense of

discomfort  around  them.  Around  their  own  kind,  gnolls

use their racial tongue and usually speak in the imperative,

considering it polite to show strength by phrasing statements

as commands rather than requests.

Roleplaying Application: It is a sign of weakness to ask for

things, so dont do it often. You understand that others dont

speak in commands the way your people do, but sometimes

you slip into old habits. Those who ask too often or who

phrase everything as a question are unworthy of respect,

for they are weak.

GNOLL ENCOUNTERS

The gnoll barbarian described below makes an excellent addi-

tion to a pack of the standard gnolls described in the Monster

GNOLL ADVENTURES

Adventures featuring evil gnolls as antagonists are usually

straightforward affairsthe vicious humanoids attack sen-

tient prey whenever they have the chance, and adventurers

must often stop their depredations. Adventures featuring

neutral gnolls, however, pose much greater challenges and

might force characters to reevaluate their own beliefs and

behaviors.  These  adventures  could  be  as  simple  as  the

characters siding with the rare group of honorable gnolls

to  fight  off  some  other  menacing  force,  or  they  might

be  more  involved,  introducing  the  gnolls  rst  through

the  suspicious  eyes  of  human  villagers  and  then  slowly

presenting evidence that the gnolls are not evil like most

of their kin. As the characters face the growing certainty

that the gnolls are not evil or cruel, they must decide for

themselves how to act and whether or not to believe these

unusual gnolls. If they make the decision to believe them,

they must play a part in building trust between the gnolls

and the human villagers who still nd the hyena-headed

humanoids frightening.

A  group  of  gnolls  has  approached  a  human  village

about opening trade between the tribe and the village.

The village elder who is going to meet with the tribe

needs  an  escort.  While  the  negotiations  take  place,  a

group of evil gnolls attacks the tribe seeking to trade.

Although  the  first  tribes  leaders  are  sincere  in  their

desire to trade with the civilized races, the tribe still

harbors worshipers of Yeenoghu, who have worked to

bring the tribe of evil gnolls here to destroy both the

peaceful gnolls and the human village. In addition to

fighting the evil gnolls, the adventurers will have their

hands full trying to keep the negotiations going after

the attacks.

A powerful gnoll warrior has gathered a huge number

of his people together. Although this warrior-king has

no  love  for  the  cruelty  of  Yeenoghu,  neither  does  he

trust the kingdoms of man. Facing an incursion by other

evil humanoids, the human kingdoms are in dire need

of aid. The adventurers must travel through the gnoll

lands, discern whether the gnoll king can be trusted,

and  then  prove  themselves  to  the  savage  but  honor-

able gnoll king. Earning his respect requires the swift

completion of a dangerous quest, and one misstep in

deed or etiquette will confirm his suspicions about the

civilized races and prevent him from coming to the aid

of the human kingdoms.

GNOLL MONSTER CLASS

Humanoid (Gnoll)

Gnolls are physically powerful humanoids with hyenalike

heads. Gnolls have 2 racial Hit Dice and a level adjustment

of +1, making a regular gnoll the equivalent of a 3rd-level

character. If you want to start playing a gnoll at 1st level, you

can use the monster class described below.

Racial Traits

Characters using the gnoll monster class start with the fol-

lowing racial traits. Note that these are not identical to the

regular gnolls full suite of racial traits because the gnolls

ability  scores  and  racial  Hit  Dice  increase  with  level  as

shown below.

+2 Strength, 2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma

Medium size.

A gnolls base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Automatic Language: Gnoll. Bonus Languages: Common,

Draconic, Elven, Goblin, Orc.

Favored Class: Ranger.

Class Skills

The gnolls class skills are Listen and Spot.

Class Features

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  gnoll  monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: Gnolls are procient

with light armor, shields, and simple and martial weapons.

Feats: A gnoll begins with one feat at 1st level. After 3rd

level, he gains feats normally according to his Hit Dice.

Natural Armor: A gnoll gains a +1 natural armor bonus

to Armor Class at 3rd level.

KILLOREN

Hunter, destroyer, and keeper of ancient knowledge; I am natures

answer to the rising power of man.

Allailai, killoren ancient.

A newly risen race of powerful fey, the killoren blend natures

patience and power with the ambition and aggression of the

humanoid races.

The ancient places of the world stir with a power of their

own. From this power, the killoren have sprung in answer

to  the  growing  might  of  the  humanoid  races.  Whether

the work of some great nature deity or the spontaneous

creation of the wild power of nature itself, killoren are at

once young and eternal, newly brought to the world but

with unknowably ancient ties to the heart of nature. As fey,

killoren have a tie to nature unmatched by the humanoid

races, but unlike other fey, killoren are not content to wait

in the dark recesses of the dwindling forests.

Killoren  are  aggressive,  ambitious  manifestations  of

natures presence and power, and they walk through the

cities of man as easily as they meditate in the glades of a

verdant forest. There are as yet few killoren in the world

compared to the population of humans and other humanoid

races, but their numbers are quickly growing. So far, these

adaptable fey have only come into isolated conict with evil

powers bent on despoiling nature, but it is obvious that they

are  destined  for  more.  The  killoren  have  begun  to  make

known their presence in the world, and a few far-seeing and

learned sages wonder at the implications of their growing

power and numbers.

KILLOREN RACIAL TRAITS

Killoren  resemble  half-elves,  and  males  and  females  alike

average about 5-1/2 feet in height. They mature quickly, being

full-grown by the age of 10, and live very long lives, hardly

changing at all in appearance for their rst century. Killoren

have green or tan skin the texture of a soft, young leaf, and

their limbs are unusually long and slender when compared

with those of the humanoid races. An individual killorens

hair and eye color depends on which aspect of nature the

killoren is currently manifesting.

Fey:  Killoren  are  of  the  fey  type  and  are  therefore  not

affected  by  spells  such  as  charm  person  and  hold  person.

Unlike other fey, killoren gain Hit Dice only by acquiring

levels in a character class.

A killorens base land speed is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Killoren can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions

of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

Immunity to magic sleep effects and a +2 racial bonus on

saves against enchantment spells or effects.

Racial Skills: Killoren have a +2 racial bonus on Handle

Animal and Survival checks.

Cold Iron Anathema (Su): Killoren have a difcult time

wielding weapons made of cold iron. Killoren take a 2 pen-

alty on any attack roll they make with a cold iron weapon

or a weapon made only partially out of cold iron, such as

a cold iron spear or a bow ring cold iron arrows.

Manifest  Natures  Might  (Su):  Killoren  are  forever

bound to the raw forces of nature itself, manifesting this

bond even in their physical form. A killoren can only

manifest one aspect of natures might at a time. Each

morning as the sun rises, a killoren spends 10 minutes

in quiet meditation, filling her spirit with the aspect of

nature that is most needed for her current tasks. Once

a killoren chooses an aspect, she manifests that aspect

until the next morning, when she chooses again which

aspect to manifest. Many killoren favor one aspect over

the others and rarely choose to manifest one of the other

two aspects.

Aspect of the Ancient: While manifesting the aspect

of the ancient, a killoren embodies the deep and ancient

secrets of nature itself. With this bond to natures secret

lore, a killoren gains a racial bonus on Knowledge (nature)

checks equal to her Hit Dice and gains an additional +2

bonus  on  saving  throws  against  enchantment  effects.

This  bonus  stacks  with  the  killorens  normal  racial

bonus  on  saving  throws  against  enchantment  effects.

While  a  killoren  manifests  the  aspect  of  the  ancient,

her hair turns white and her eyes turn to the color of a

blue summer sky.

Aspect of the Destroyer: Many races revere nature for its

power to destroy, but none more so than a killoren mani-

festing the aspect of the destroyer. Once per hour (up to a

maximum number of times per day equal to the characters

Charisma bonus, minimum 1), a killoren manifesting the

aspect of the destroyer can make a special smite attack that

deals extra damage to the foes of nature. When making

this smite attack, a killoren adds her Charisma bonus to

her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per

Hit Die. This smite attack works only against aberrations,

constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders, and undead. If a

killoren accidentally smites a creature that is not one of the

creature types listed above, the smite has no effect, but the

ability is still used up for that hour and counts against the

total uses per day. While a killoren manifests the aspect of

the destroyer, her hair and eyes turn a deep, lusterless black;

many nd the gaze of a killoren destroyers coal-black eyes

to be unnerving.

Aspect  of  the  Hunter:  The  hunt  affects  nearly  every

aspect of nature and claims a place of great prominence

and importance in the cycle of life. A killoren manifesting

the aspect of the hunt is bound to natures ancient tradition

of the hunt, and her senses sharpen to an amazing degree.

While manifesting the aspect of the hunt, a killoren gains

a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Hide,  Listen,  Move  Silently,  and

Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.

While a killoren manifests the aspect of the hunter, her

hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and her skin tone

becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of

the other aspects.

Automatic Languages: Common, Sylvan. Bonus Languages:

Aquan, Auran, Elven, Gnome, Ignan, Terran.

Favored Class: Druid.

KILLOREN SOCIETY

The killoren have no organized kingdoms and only a few

scattered  communities.  They  live  comfortably  in  nearly

any climate, and their dwellings and communities blend

beautifully with the natural world around them. Few mem-

bers of humanoid races are knowledgeable enough about

nature  to  recognize  where  the  wilds  end  and  a  killoren

community begins.

Lands: As yet, killoren claim no lands as their own. Kil-

loren concepts of property and land ownership differ greatly

from  those  of  the  humanoid  races:  They  see  the  world  as

belonging to nature itself. As stewards and manifestations

of nature, they might at some point deny others the right to

settle or despoil part of the wild, but their numbers are few

enough that this has not yet come to pass. In the small con-

icts that have cropped up between killoren and particular

groups  of  evil  humanoids,  the  killoren  have  not  claimed

ownership of the land, instead claiming only that they guard

the land from evil.

Settlements: Their small communities blend with the

natural  world,  but  many  killoren  are  drawn  away  from

their home community to mingle with the populations

aspect to manifest. Many killoren favor one aspect over

the others and rarely choose to manifest one of the other

two aspects.

Aspect of the Ancient: While manifesting the aspect

of the ancient, a killoren embodies the deep and ancient

secrets of nature itself. With this bond to natures secret

lore, a killoren gains a racial bonus on Knowledge (nature)

checks equal to her Hit Dice and gains an additional +2

bonus  on  saving  throws  against  enchantment  effects.

This  bonus  stacks  with  the  killorens  normal  racial

bonus  on  saving  throws  against  enchantment  effects.

While  a  killoren  manifests  the  aspect  of  the  ancient,

her hair turns white and her eyes turn to the color of a

blue summer sky.

Aspect of the Destroyer: Many races revere nature for its

power to destroy, but none more so than a killoren mani-

festing the aspect of the destroyer. Once per hour (up to a

maximum number of times per day equal to the characters

Charisma bonus, minimum 1), a killoren manifesting the

aspect of the destroyer can make a special smite attack that

deals extra damage to the foes of nature. When making

this smite attack, a killoren adds her Charisma bonus to

her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per

Hit Die. This smite attack works only against aberrations,

constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders, and undead. If a

killoren accidentally smites a creature that is not one of the

creature types listed above, the smite has no effect, but the

ability is still used up for that hour and counts against the

total uses per day. While a killoren manifests the aspect of

the destroyer, her hair and eyes turn a deep, lusterless black;

many nd the gaze of a killoren destroyers coal-black eyes

to be unnerving.

Aspect  of  the  Hunter:  The  hunt  affects  nearly  every

aspect of nature and claims a place of great prominence

and importance in the cycle of life. A killoren manifesting

the aspect of the hunt is bound to natures ancient tradition

of the hunt, and her senses sharpen to an amazing degree.

While manifesting the aspect of the hunt, a killoren gains

a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Hide,  Listen,  Move  Silently,  and

Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.

While a killoren manifests the aspect of the hunter, her

hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and her skin tone

becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of

the other aspects.

Automatic Languages: Common, Sylvan. Bonus Languages:

Aquan, Auran, Elven, Gnome, Ignan, Terran.

Favored Class: Druid.

KILLOREN SOCIETY

The killoren have no organized kingdoms and only a few

scattered  communities.  They  live  comfortably  in  nearly

any climate, and their dwellings and communities blend

beautifully with the natural world around them. Few mem-

bers of humanoid races are knowledgeable enough about

nature  to  recognize  where  the  wilds  end  and  a  killoren

community begins.

Lands: As yet, killoren claim no lands as their own. Kil-

loren concepts of property and land ownership differ greatly

from  those  of  the  humanoid  races:  They  see  the  world  as

belonging to nature itself. As stewards and manifestations

of nature, they might at some point deny others the right to

settle or despoil part of the wild, but their numbers are few

enough that this has not yet come to pass. In the small con-

icts that have cropped up between killoren and particular

groups  of  evil  humanoids,  the  killoren  have  not  claimed

ownership of the land, instead claiming only that they guard

the land from evil.

Settlements: Their small communities blend with the

natural  world,  but  many  killoren  are  drawn  away  from

their home community to mingle with the populations

of the humanoid races. A killoren community might be as

simple as a few families dwelling among the boughs and

shade of a peaceful forest or as remote as a small group

of killoren following game across the frozen steppes of

the far north.

Power  Groups:  Killoren  communities  are  usually

governed by a group of elder druids and wizards, but any

individual killoren might rise to leadership depending on

his  or  her  personal  exploits.  These  leaders  act  more  as

councilors and protectors than as an organized form of

government, the small size of killoren communities keep-

ing their roles relatively simple compared to the politics of

the humanoid races.

As the number of killoren grows, so too does their dif-

ference in outlook. A small group of elder killoren, some

having walked among the humanoid races for a hundred

years or more, believe they have seen enough  of  humans

and the allied civilized races. Calling themselves simply The

Wild, these powerful killoren have chosen to defend their

refuges  with  magical  and  physical  force.  Many of these

killoren are druids and wizards, and their radical outlook

is quickly drawing the attention of both other killoren and

the armies of the human kingdoms.

Beliefs: Most killoren revere the silent might of nature

itself, although some, particularly clerics, pay homage to the

god Obad-Hai. Killoren do not simply admire naturethey

are part of it. A killoren cannot look at a distant mountain

range without feeling its power and beauty stir her, nor can

a killoren walk through a forest glade without being moved

by the peace and strength of nature. Nature is more than a

distant ideal to the killoren; it is life itself.

Relations: Although tension grows between the killoren

and  the  humanoid  kingdoms,  for  the  most  part  killoren

remain  a  curiosity  in  the  eyes  of  the  humans  and  their

allies. Killoren walk freely within the cities of almost every

civilized race. Of all the humanoid races, the elves are closest

in outlook to the killoren, but even the elves remain curious

about the killorens recent origin and their ultimate role in

natures plan.

KILLOREN CHARACTERS

Killoren  characters  range  from  powerful  and  zealous

defenders of nature to inquisitive and insightful students

of humanoid cultures. The killorens ability to manifest

different aspects of natures power lets them fill multiple

roles in a party of adventurers, depending on the expected

encounters  and  adventures.  Killoren  NPCs  hint  at  the

growing  unrest  of  powerful  natural  forces,  adding  a

sense  of  mystery  and  danger  to  the  wild  places  of  the

campaign world.

Adventuring  Killoren:  Killoren  adventure  to  learn

about the world. Unlike other fey, killoren are driven by

the nameless powers of nature to learn about the humanoid

races  and  customs.  Killoren  match  the  aggression  and

ambition of humanoids, but they also maintain the eternal

connection to nature that all fey embody. As killoren grow

in power and number, they form ever-changing opinions

of  humans  and  their  allies,  helping  the  causes  that  they

deem to be one with natures design and opposing those

who would despoil or destroy natures beauty. Experienced

killoren might adventure with a more de nite purpose

working  to  thwart  the  schemes  of  a  particular  religious

cult, protecting nature from wild orcs and goblinoids, or

hunting powerful outsiders that are beyond the reach of

natures other servants.

Character  Development:  Killoren  characters  are  best

served  by  focusing  on  one  aspect  and  ensuring  that  the

abilities they favor work well with the choices they make

concerning  skills,  feats,  and  class  levels.  Because  of  their

obvious connection with nature, many adventuring killoren

advance  as  rangers  and  druids.  Perhaps  more  intriguing,

however, are those killoren who take levels in other classes

such as wizard or paladin, yet retain their unswerving con-

nection to the power of nature.

Character Names: Killoren have only one name, and

they choose this name themselves upon declaring their

own maturity, usually near the beginning of their tenth

year of life. Killoren names always have three syllables, the

last of which denotes their family in the same way that a

humans family name shows his or her relation. Example

killoren names include Durmindin, Ennimbel, Kettenbar,

and Shallahai.

ROLEPLAYING A KILLOREN

With the power of nature forever bonded to their souls, kil-

loren characters have both the enigmatic outlook of the fey

and the inquisitive drive of the humanoid races. This unique

outlook,  combined  with  the  unusual  ability  to  manifest

different  aspects  of  natures  own  power,  makes  killoren  a

challenge to roleplay. When roleplaying a killoren, you must

make the reverence of nature a subtle yet ever-present aspect

of your personality without overdoing it, and you must be

ready to express markedly different aspects of your characters

personality depending on which aspect of nature you choose

to manifest each day.

Personality:  Killoren  have  an  innate  connection  to

natures power; as such, the natural world and its best inter-

ests are never far from their thoughts. Killoren also differ

from other races in that they have three different aspects

of  their  personality  that  correspond  with  their  ability  to

manifest different aspects of natures might. Killoren who

manifest the destroyer aspect are arrogant and aggressive,

those who manifest the aspect of the hunter are stealthy and

subtle,  and  those  who  manifest  the  aspect  of  the  ancient

think  carefully  and  look  deep  into  the  heart  of  a  matter

before voicing their thoughts.

Roleplaying  Application:  Make  the  most  of  the  differ-

ent aspects of nature that you manifest by accentuating

the  changes  in  your  characters  personality  with  each

change.  Dont  overdo  itthis  ability  is  not  a  case  of

three separate personalities. Rather, its an opportunity

to build multiple aspects of one character. The best way

to do this is to make a short list of common sayings or

expression your character uses and then change the tone

and delivery depending on the aspect that your character

is manifesting.

Behaviors: Just as their personality changes slightly when

they manifest a different aspect, the behaviors of individual

killoren change slightly depending on the aspect that they

are manifesting.

Roleplaying Application: The best way to reinforce

the differences between the aspects of nature

that  your  character  manifests  is  with  body

language. Sit forward in your chair and speak

a little bit louder when manifesting the aspect

of  the  destroyer;  sit  back  and  think  before

speaking when manifesting the aspect of the

ancient; and make quick, darting movements

when  manifesting  the  aspect  of  the  hunter.

Develop one or two obvious idiosyncrasies that

only surface when your character is manifest-

ing a specific aspect.

Language: Killoren make a great effort to

speak as those around them speak. Learning

the  speaking  styles  as  well  as  the  language

of  the  humanoids  they  are  with  gives  them

greater insight into the culture and attitudes

of their friends.

Roleplaying Application: Make it a point to pick

up on the sayings and speaking rhythms of those

you are with. This includes notable NPCs as well as

your fellow player characters. Dont go so far as to mimic

anyone; that is not the killoren way. Rather, pay attention

to the way others speak as well as what they say and try to

slip a few sayings of theirs into your own dialogue.

KILLOREN ENCOUNTERS

Killoren are enigmatic fey, and as such they serve a cam-

paign better as occasional neutral parties rather than direct

antagonists. Hinting that the inquisitive and ambitious fey

are growing in number and power will serve to build tension

normally absent from encounters with fey creatures.

EL 4: Two killoren travelers. Although killoren usually

travel alone, a pair of killoren travelers might investigate a

large community or track a party of adventurers (perhaps

the player characters) to learn of their activities.

Survival +6 (+8 following tracks); Point Blank Shot, Track.

Languages: Common, Elven, Sylvan.

Favored Enemy (Ex): This killoren traveler has selected

humans  as  a  favored  enemy.  She  gains  a  +2  bonus  on  her

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when

using these skills against humans. She gets the same bonus

on weapon damage rolls against humans.

Manifest Natures Might (Su): This killoren traveler

is manifesting the aspect of the hunter, which increases

her skill modifiers as follows: Hide +9, Listen +7, Move

Silently  +9,  and  Spot  +7.  It  also  increases  her  initiative

bonus to +4.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This killoren traveler deals an extra

1d6 points of damage on any successful attack against  at-

footed or  anked targets, or against a target that has been

denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also

applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away.

Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible

anatomies,  and  creatures  immune  to  extra  damage  from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. The killoren

traveler may choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her

KILLOREN ADVENTURES

Adventures  featuring  the  killoren  are  likely  to  center  on

natural themes, particularly natures response to civilization.

Just as killoren give players a chance to reach for an alien

mind-set  and  a  unique  roleplaying  experience,  they  offer

DMs a chance to show the characters that there are more than

two sides to many conicts. Despite the multitude of good

forces in the world, few are entirely on the side of nature;

the killoren are the fey that nature can count on to ght for

it should the need arise.

A killoren traveler has been asking pointed questions

about a towns recent growth. As farmers stretch their

fields ever closer to an ancient forest, many in the town

are wondering if there will be some sort of conflict with

the denizens of the forest. In truth, the killoren is new

to the area and seeks only to protect the town from a

young green dragon that has been hunting the forests

edges recently. Seeing the dragon as a natural predator,

however, she does not wish to attract dragonslayers or

other  powerful  heroes  to  the  area  before  the  dragon

moves on.

Something  large  and  powerful  has  been  seen  in  the

heart  of  an  ancient  woodland.  Even  the  killoren,  the

most forthcoming denizens of the forest, do not know

what it represents or what it is. Legends tell of a power-

ful avatar of the forests might, but no one knows why it

might have been awakened or whether it might venture

out of the forest.

any  wilderness  characters  eventually

pursue advancement in one prestige class

or another. The elves, in particular, follow

many  different  paths  in  their  careers.

As creative individualists, elves see great

value in nding a way uniquely suited to each person. Many

elven  martial  traditionsarcane  archery,  bladesinging,

spellsinging, and morewere born of talented individuals

seeking the perfect and unique expression of their talents

with spell, song, and sword.

The prestige classes described here reect the strengths

and values of the races who live in wilderness settings.

Still, they can work well with nearly any race, not just those

detailed in this book. In addition to the new prestige classes

presented here, dont  overlook  these prestige  classes from

other sourcebooks:

Arcane Archer (Dungeon Masters Guide): Considered by

some the pinnacle of elven archery, the arcane archer is a

deadly ranged combatant.

Arcane Trickster (Dungeon Masters Guide): Many elves

and haling rogues nd it useful to combine the study of

magic and the art of stealth.

Archmage (Dungeon Masters Guide): Elf wizards often

reach the great heights of magical might required to become

an archmage.

Bladesinger (Complete Warrior): Practitioner of the quint-

essential elven martial art, the bladesinger is both a skilled

mage and a deadly swordmaster.

Dervish (Complete Warrior): Known for blinding speed

and graceful swordplay, the dervish appeals to elves,

halings, and raptorans alike.

Duelist (Dungeon Masters Guide): Relying on speed

and agility more than brute strength, elves, raptorans,

and halings who excel at swordplay are all drawn to

the duelist prestige class.

Eldritch Knight (Dungeon Masters Guide): Elves

embody the combination of martial prowess and magi-

cal skill exemplied by the eldritch knight, and many

elves follow the path of sword and staff.

Haling Outrider (Complete Warrior): Naturally,

many halings follow the way of the outrider, using

the speed and power of a mount to make up for their

small size.

Loremaster (Dungeon Masters Guide): Known for

their love of learning and memories of things long

past, elves are natural loremasters.

Mystic Theurge (Dungeon Masters Guide): Since

elves often combine the study of arcane magic with

another calling, many elf clerics pursue the path of the

mystic theurge.

107

Shadowdancer  (Dungeon  Masters  Guide):  As  natural

rogues, hal ings are sometimes drawn to the hidden arts of

the shadowdancer.

Spellsword (Complete Warrior): Like the bladesinger, the

spellsword masters both spell and blade. Both elves and

hal ings are drawn to this prestige class.

Sublime Chord (Complete Arcane): Elf bards are often

drawn to this prestige class, which permits a bard to achieve

unrivalled heights of magical power.

Wild Mage (Complete Arcane): The masters of chaotic

magic, wild mages are often elves or hal ings.

ARCANE HIEROPHANT

Theres nothing unnatural about magic. Magic ebbs and  ows

through the very earth where you stand, the air that your breathe,

and the water that you drink. A  re has some magic of its own,

as Im sure youll agree when it warms you on a cold day or cooks

your food.

Altherion Duniiloli, arcane hierophant

Arcane hierophants wield a blending of arcane magic and

divine magic with a heavy emphasis on nature and the

elements. Though they possess the learning and discipline

commonly associated with wizards, they also have practical

knowledge of the natural world commonly associated with

druids. Like druids, they can change shape into animal

and  elemental  forms,  but  they  also  can  wield  powerful

arcane spells.

BECOMING AN

ARCANE HIEROPHANT

Multiclassing as a wizard/druid provides the quickest path

to becoming an arcane hierophant, though you can meet the

arcane spellcasting requirements as a bard or sorcerer and

the divine spellcasting requirements as a relatively high-level

ranger. Youll need druid or ranger levels to meet the class

feature requirements. Intelligence or Wisdom (either one

can govern your spellcasting) is a key ability for you. A high

Dexterity score can prove helpful to you in combat, both to

improve your Armor Class and to help you beat the opposition

to the punch with a quick spell.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 8

ranks.

Spells: Ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells and 2nd-level

divine spells.

Special: Trackless step class feature.

CLASS FEATURES

As they advance in level, arcane hierophants improve their

spellcasting abilities. They also learn how to change shape,

and they develop powers that allow them to use plants and

animals as weapons and tools.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: You gain no pro ciency

in any weapons or armor. You abide by the same armor restric-

tions that druids do, and you lose your divine spellcasting

ability and supernatural or spell-like class abilities if you

wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield.

Spellcasting:  At  each  level,  you  gain  new  spells  per

day  and  an  increase  in  caster  level  (and  spells  known,  if

applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  an  arcane

spellcasting class and a level in a divine spellcasting class to

which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

You do not, however, gain any other class feature a character

of that class would have gained. If you had more than one

arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcast-

ing class before becoming an arcane hierophant, you must

decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of

determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Ignore Arcane Spell Failure: When casting an arcane

spell,  you  ignore  the  arcane  spell  failure  chance  for  any

nonmetallic light or medium armor (padded, leather, or hide

armor). You learn to cast arcane spells while wearing the types

of armor that druids favor.

Wild Shape (Su): If you do not already possess the ability,

you gain no new ability to wild shape. However,  you  add

your arcane hierophant level to your druid level and gain

the wild shape ability of a druid of the resulting level. For

example,  a  character  who  is  a  3rd-level  wizard/3rd-level

druid/4th-level arcane hierophant has the wild shape ability

of a 7th-level druid. If you are not a druid, (for example, if

you entered the class as a wizard/ranger), you do not gain the

ability to wild shape.

Companion  Familiar:  Upon  becoming  an  arcane

hierophant, you must dismiss your familiar, if you have one.

(You do not risk losing XP for doing so.) You may retain any

one animal companion you already possess. You add your

arcane hierophant class level to your druid or ranger level

for purposes of determining your animal companions bonus

Hit Dice, natural armor adjustment, and Strength/Dexterity

adjustment (see the sidebar The Druids Animal Companion,

page 36 of the Players Handbook). For example, a character

who is a 4th-level druid/3rd-level wizard/4th-level arcane

hierophant has the animal companion of an 8th-level druid

(+4 bonus HD, +4 natural armor, and +2 Strength/Dexterity

adjustment, or an animal companion chosen from the 4th-

level or 7th-level lists).

In addition, your animal companion (if any) gains many

of the abilities that a familiar would normally possess.

You add your arcane hierophant class level to your arcane

spellcasting class level, and determine the Intelligence

bonus  and  special  abilities  of  your  animal  companion

accordingly  (see  the  sidebar  Familiars,  page  53  of  the

Players Handbook). For example, a 4th-level druid/3rd-level

wizard/4th-level arcane hierophant has a familiar compan-

ion equal to that of a 7th-level wizard and 8th-level druid

(Intelligence 9, alertness, improved evasion, share spells,

empathic  link,  deliver  touch  spells,  speak  with  master,

speak with animals of its kind, devotion).

(but not creatures of the plant type) once per day. This abil-

ity functions like the channel animal class feature, except

that the line of effect from the plant to the target is based

on your senses.

You can use this power to deliver touch spells through

the plant. Once you cast the spell, the plant is considered

to be holding the charge for the spell (see page 176 of the

Players Handbook), except that the spell is delivered to the

 rst creature or object that can receive the spell when the

subject touches the plant.

At 10th level, you gain a second daily use of your channel

The Hit Dice, hit points, attack bonus, saving throws,

feats, and skills of the familiar companion are determined

as normal for an animal companion. Due to the familiar

companions unusual Intelligence score, it may very well

have  more  skill  points  than  other  animals  of  its  kind.

The familiar companion is a magical beast (augmented

animal),  but  you  can  bestow  harmless  spells  on  your

familiar companion as if it were an animal instead of a

magical beast.

If your familiar companion is killed or dismissed, you

do  not  lose  XP.  You  can  summon  a  new  familiar  com-

panion by performing a ceremony requiring 24 hours of

uninterrupted prayer.

Channel Animal (Sp): Starting at 4th level, you gain the

ability twice per day to establish a magical conduit between

yourself and a single animal that you touch (including your

familiar companion). For each use of this class feature,

a spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can

originate from the animal instead of from

you, provided that you have line of sight

and  line  of  effect  to  the  animal.  The

spells  line  of  effect  then  extends  from

the animal to the target based on the senses

of the animal, not you.

You can also use this power to deliver touch

spells through the animal. Once you cast the

spell, the animal is considered to be holding

the charge for the spell (see page 176 of the

Players Handbook).

Starting at 8th level, you gain two additional

uses of this ability each day.

Channel  Plant  (Sp):  Starting  at  6th

level, you gain the ability to establish a magical

Edrec, an arcane hierophant, accompanied by his dire boar companion familiar

109

Shadowdancer  (Dungeon  Masters  Guide):  As  natural

rogues, hal ings are sometimes drawn to the hidden arts of

the shadowdancer.

Spellsword (Complete Warrior): Like the bladesinger, the

spellsword masters both spell and blade. Both elves and

PLAYING AN ARCANE HIEROPHANT

Think  deeply,  but  creatively.  Your  character  relies  on  a

deep understanding of magic and nature for his powers.

He didnt get where he is, however, by thinking inside the

box. He has forged his own way by melding two distinct

magical  traditions  to  create  a  potent  new  whole.  Your

thoughts and actions should reect that blending of nature

and magic.

Avoid emotion and excess.

Nature  wastes  nothing

and  proceeds  without

emotion or sentimental-

ity. You need not be dour,

but  calm  deliberation

suits your character better

than recklessness or a volatile

temper. Be wary of unexpected

results and unintended conse-

quences from your actions.

Take risks if you must, but

stick to calculated risks.

When  you  ponder

an  action,  know

what youre likely

to achieve if suc-

cessful  and  what

youre  likely  to  lose

if  you  fail.  Reject  courses

of  action  that  expose  you

to losses greater than your

potential gains.

Be  persistent.  In  time,  the

wind can wear away a mountain,

so  dont  get  discouraged  when

things dont go your way. Still,

strike  hard  when  you  can.  A

stroke of lightning cleaves away

rock faster than sand blown on the wind.

Show reverence for natures beauty and bounty.

Oppose  the  wanton  destruction  of  natural  places

and objects.

An arcane hierophant uses his

channel plant ability to make a

lightning bolt erupt from a tree

Combat

Your wild shape ability can make you an effective combatant

when the need arises, but your strength lies in your spells,

and you dont have the Armor Class or hit points to ght in

the front line all the time. Your combination of arcane and

divine spellcasting ability gives you access to all the offensive

spells youre likely to need, so dont forget to prepare a variety

of  utilitarian  spells  that  provide  you  and  your  party  with

healing, information gathering, and mobility.

Advancement

Arcane hierophant circles usually keep a close watch on

any  potential  new  members  operating  in  or  near  their

110

areas. They pay special attention to characters who choose

on their own to multiclass as druid/wizards (recognizing

kindred spirits), but they often study and secretly groom

any spellcasters who show an interest in nature. They may

approach such characters with opportunities for adventur-

ing  in  the  wild,  such  as  tracking  and  rescuing  captives,

intercepting raids, or even locating and propagating rare

plants and animals.

Once accepted into a circle (see Organizations, below), a

new arcane hierophant is expected to continue his divine

and arcane studies, maintain and defend the circles citadel,

and  undertake  such  missions  as  might  become  necessary

to  maintain  the  circles  in-

tegrity. These might include

reconnaissance missions (to

determine  the  whereabouts

and  intentions  of  potential

enemies),  diplomatic  mis-

sions,  and  seeing  to  the

protection  and  training  of

prospective  new  recruits  to

the circle.

If  you  have  the

ability to wild shape,

many options open

up for you. The ability

is good for fighting, but

you  also  can  fly,  swim,

and even pass through

solid ground when in

elemental form, mak-

ing  you  an  excellent

scout  and  infiltrator.

Dont forget to take the

Natural Spell feat in order to

be able to use your formidable

spellcasting  abilities  while

using wild shape.

Dont  overlook

the  tactical  possibili-

ties  that  your  channel

power gives you. You can literally cast spells around corners

though the use of this ability. You may need to combine it

with  some  divination  to  get  a  decent  idea  of  where  your

spell is aimed.

Resources

As a member of a circle, you have access to the circles citadel.

Many citadels are little more than secret hideouts where

you can stay for a night or two in reasonable safety. More

inuential and powerful circles have citadels that contain

libraries and laboratories for your use and a staff of servants

and guards for assistance and protection.

Membership in a circle brings you in contact with other

characters who share your ideals and your commitment

to  nature  and  to  magic  and  who  might  be  available  to

accompany you on adventures. A circle may include wild-

runners, druids, rangers, wizards, and maybe even some

mid- to high-level barbarians. Such characters generally

have  starting  attitudes  of  friendly  toward  you  but  will

expect some sort of compensation (such as a little cash up

front and a cut of the proceeds after the adventure). These

characters might help you in other ways such as casting

spells for you or even creating items. Youll still have to

pay the going rate for such services, but at least word of

what youre doing wont spread beyond the circle. Likewise

if youre strapped for cash you might purchase services

or items in return for your own labor (or for a favor to be

named later).

ARCANE HIEROPHANTS

IN THE WORLD

If the PCs get involved in the diplomacy, politics, or trade that

passes between different groups in the wild, theyll eventually

meet arcane hierophantsthough they might not recognize

them for what they are. To the casual observer, theres not

much difference between an arcane hierophant and a druid

or wizard. When you need an inscrutable character to convey

information, render aid, or launch a magical attack in the

wilderness, an arcane hierophant (or a whole circle of them)

can serve very well indeed.

Organization

Arcane hierophants band together in groups called circles.

A  circle  traditionally  has  at  least  seven  members  (though

in theory even a single arcane hierophant might establish

a  circle)  and  seldom  more  than  two  dozen  members  (not

including  guards  and  servants).  Each  circle  maintains  a

secret retreat, called a citadel, where the members can meet to

study, train, and discuss matters of mutual interest. A citadel

is  usually  located  in  an  area  of  great  natural  beauty,  such

as a mountain valley, sylvan glade, or island. Some circles,

however, operate within cities, and their citadels might be

located near waterways, gardens, or markets where produce

or other natural products are sold.

Most circles value their privacy, but they dont take great

pains to conceal their existence (though they invariably keep

the  location  of  their  citadel  secret).  Some  circles  operate

publicly and others covertly, as their members prefer.

Each  circle  has  a  leader,  usually  called  the  speaker,

chosen for his magical accomplishments, leadership skills,

and  persuasiveness.  A  speaker  is  often,  but  not  always,

the most powerful spellcaster in the circle. Beyond that,

a circle has no formal organization, though an informal

hierarchy based on seniority and merit develops in well-

established circles.

Circles usually have no formal names. For convenience,

the members choose some fairly meaningless name or sim-

ply adopt the name of the circles founder or one of its more

famous members. Circle members avoid names based on the

location or appearance of their citadel, because that informa-

tion is supposed to be secret. Typical circle names include The

Fellowship of Cymbeline, Servants of the Harvest, Friends

of the Highwood, and Syngils Watchers.

The only circle member with any real duties is the speaker,

who keeps track of the other members and their doings, stays

in contact with other circles, and sees to it that someone

(often the speaker himself) maintains the citadel and trains

new members.

Many arcane hierophants (especially halings and adven-

turers of all kinds) become associated with several different

circles as they roam about. These itinerant members almost

never serve as speakers; they move from citadel to citadel,

exchanging  news  with  the  local  arcane  hierophants  and

taking on any tasks for which a relative outsider might be

well suited. The Circle of the Open Road provides a notable

exception to this rule: It is a mobile circle in which halings

make up most of the membership. Their speaker, a tallfellow

haling called Feideal Chestnutsower, is known for his love

of roasted chestnuts and his penchant for planting chestnut

trees wherever he goes.

NPC Reactions

Arcane hierophants provoke a wide variety of reactions,

depending on their own actions and the ideals and prejudices

of the people they meet.

A known member of a circle often stands in high regard

among commoners in the area where the circle is located,

especially if the circle has been active in defending the area,

dealing with natural disasters, or giving support and advice.

Such commoners will have an indifferent starting attitude

at worst.

Not all circles are benign, however, and local folk prob-

ably  have  an  unfriendly  or  even  hostile  starting  attitude

when  a  circle  has  been  acting  contrary  to  their  interests,

such as interfering with attempts at settlement, breeding or

introducing predatory animals, or disrupting activities such

as mining or woodcutting.

Many druids look upon arcane hierophants as dabblers in

the ethos of the druid and are indifferent at best. Some druids

look  upon  arcane  hierophants  as  heretical  or  iconoclastic

because of their mingling of nature and magic. The major

point  of  disagreement  is  how  arcane  hierophants  think

about nature and magic. They see both as forces that can

be understood and manipulated, an idea many druids nd

deeply offensive. These druids usually prove hostile to the

arcane hierophant circle.

Other druids regard arcane hierophants as kindred spirits

and tend toward friendly starting attitudes upon meeting

them. These druids may become allies or even members of

an arcane hierophant circle.

Rangers and bards usually respect arcane hierophants for

their knowledge and magical powers.

PLAYING AN ARCANE HIEROPHANT

Think  deeply,  but  creatively.  Your  character  relies  on  a

deep understanding of magic and nature for his powers.

He didnt get where he is, however, by thinking inside the

box. He has forged his own way by melding two distinct

magical  traditions  to  create  a  potent  new  whole.  Your

thoughts and actions should reect that blending of nature

and magic.

Avoid emotion and excess.

Nature  wastes  nothing

and  proceeds  without

emotion or sentimental-

ity. You need not be dour,

but  calm  deliberation

suits your character better

than recklessness or a volatile

temper. Be wary of unexpected

results and unintended conse-

quences from your actions.

Take risks if you must, but

stick to calculated risks.

When  you  ponder

an  action,  know

what youre likely

to achieve if suc-

cessful  and  what

youre  likely  to  lose

if  you  fail.  Reject  courses

of  action  that  expose  you

to losses greater than your

potential gains.

Be  persistent.  In  time,  the

wind can wear away a mountain,

so  dont  get  discouraged  when

things dont go your way. Still,

strike  hard  when  you  can.  A

stroke of lightning cleaves away

rock faster than sand blown on the wind.

Show reverence for natures beauty and bounty.

Oppose  the  wanton  destruction  of  natural  places

and objects.

An arcane hierophant uses his

channel plant ability to make a

lightning bolt erupt from a tree

Combat

Your wild shape ability can make you an effective combatant

when the need arises, but your strength lies in your spells,

and you dont have the Armor Class or hit points to ght in

the front line all the time. Your combination of arcane and

divine spellcasting ability gives you access to all the offensive

spells youre likely to need, so dont forget to prepare a variety

of  utilitarian  spells  that  provide  you  and  your  party  with

healing, information gathering, and mobility.

Advancement

Arcane hierophant circles usually keep a close watch on

any  potential  new  members  operating  in  or  near  their

110

areas. They pay special attention to characters who choose

on their own to multiclass as druid/wizards (recognizing

kindred spirits), but they often study and secretly groom

any spellcasters who show an interest in nature. They may

approach such characters with opportunities for adventur-

ing  in  the  wild,  such  as  tracking  and  rescuing  captives,

intercepting raids, or even locating and propagating rare

plants and animals.

Once accepted into a circle (see Organizations, below), a

new arcane hierophant is expected to continue his divine

and arcane studies, maintain and defend the circles citadel,

and  undertake  such  missions  as  might  become  necessary

to  maintain  the  circles  in-

tegrity. These might include

reconnaissance missions (to

determine  the  whereabouts

and  intentions  of  potential

enemies),  diplomatic  mis-

sions,  and  seeing  to  the

protection  and  training  of

prospective  new  recruits  to

the circle.

If  you  have  the

ability to wild shape,

many options open

up for you. The ability

is good for fighting, but

you  also  can  fly,  swim,

and even pass through

solid ground when in

elemental form, mak-

ing  you  an  excellent

scout  and  infiltrator.

Dont forget to take the

Natural Spell feat in order to

be able to use your formidable

spellcasting  abilities  while

using wild shape.

Dont  overlook

the  tactical  possibili-

ties  that  your  channel

power gives you. You can literally cast spells around corners

though the use of this ability. You may need to combine it

with  some  divination  to  get  a  decent  idea  of  where  your

spell is aimed.

Resources

As a member of a circle, you have access to the circles citadel.

Many citadels are little more than secret hideouts where

you can stay for a night or two in reasonable safety. More

inuential and powerful circles have citadels that contain

libraries and laboratories for your use and a staff of servants

and guards for assistance and protection.

Membership in a circle brings you in contact with other

characters who share your ideals and your commitment

to  nature  and  to  magic  and  who  might  be  available  to

accompany you on adventures. A circle may include wild-

runners, druids, rangers, wizards, and maybe even some

mid- to high-level barbarians. Such characters generally

have  starting  attitudes  of  friendly  toward  you  but  will

expect some sort of compensation (such as a little cash up

front and a cut of the proceeds after the adventure). These

characters might help you in other ways such as casting

spells for you or even creating items. Youll still have to

pay the going rate for such services, but at least word of

what youre doing wont spread beyond the circle. Likewise

if youre strapped for cash you might purchase services

or items in return for your own labor (or for a favor to be

named later).

ARCANE HIEROPHANTS

IN THE WORLD

If the PCs get involved in the diplomacy, politics, or trade that

passes between different groups in the wild, theyll eventually

meet arcane hierophantsthough they might not recognize

them for what they are. To the casual observer, theres not

much difference between an arcane hierophant and a druid

or wizard. When you need an inscrutable character to convey

information, render aid, or launch a magical attack in the

the  following  material,  including  the  information  from

lower DCs.

DC 10: Arcane hierophants wield the magical might of

both arcane spellcasters and powerful druids. Many can take

on the forms of animals and imbue the creatures and plants

around them with dangerous or useful spells.

DC 15: Groups of arcane hierophants are called circles,

and their functions vary, depending on their location and the

temperaments of their members. Arcane hierophant circles

are loosely organized under a single leader, called a speaker.

The speaker represents the circle in relations with outsiders

but has little real authority.

DC 20: Arcane hierophants believe that magic is just

another force of nature, and they behave accordingly. They

share many of the same values and philosophical ideas as

druids but lack the druids commitment to neutrality and

the natural order.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about the specic circles in your

campaign, including notable members, the areas where they

operate, and the kinds of activities they undertake.

PCs  trying  to  establish  contact  with  a  circle  of  arcane

hierophants for some reason can do so through a Gather

Information check. The check DC depends on how open

the circle members are about their activities and goals; it

can range from 10 for a circle that operates publicly to 20 for

a clandestine circle. Most circles dont bother to keep their

existence a secret, but they dont advertise their presence

either. Contacting such a circle requires a DC 15 Gather

Information check. In any case, a successful check either

puts you in contact with the speaker or with an intermediary

or ally of the circle.

Discovering the whereabouts of a circles citadel takes at

least a DC 25 Gather Information check, and the task could

be much more difcult or simply impossible.

ARCANE HIEROPHANTS

IN THE GAME

Given their semisecretive nature, its easy to introduce arcane

hierophants to the game. The PCs could meet one while

traveling, or perhaps a druid or wizard they know chooses to

multiclass and eventually enters the prestige class.

The prestige class appeals to players who like to wield ashy

magic but nd sorcerers and wizards a little too fragile.

Adaptation

Arcane hierophants are relatively rare as presented here,

but  you  can  decide  otherwise  for  your  own  campaign.

You could create a great circle of arcane hierophants as

the ruling magocracy (or theocracy) in a particular land,

such  as  an  elf  kingdom  or  an  unspoiled  human  realm.

Entrusted with the learning and lore of a kingdom, arcane

hierophants choose the lands kings, hold the powers of

high and low justice, and guide the lands defense against

the dangers all around.

Encounters

Arcane hierophants can be effective villains who practice

the same sorts of nefarious deeds that other evil spellcasters

engage in.

EL 13: Edrec believes that humans are the most danger-

ous plague ever to blight his beloved forests because of

their voracious appetite for land to clear, timber to cut, and

furs to sell. He wages a bitter and lonely war against all the

human settlements nearby, killing farmers, woodcutters,

and trappers without a word of warning. Edrec has come

to believe that no tactic or weapon is too foul to use against

humans, so he gathers monsters of all kinds to attack human

settlements  and  travelers.  He  is  allied  to  Yeshelvarra,  a

young adult green dragon who gladly collects the plunder

of Edrecs attacks. The PCs might stumble across one of

Edrecs rampaging dire animals, or perhaps human villagers

beg the PCs to aid them against the dark and angry forest

power that besets them.

Many evil warriors believe that elves, while dangerous in

ranged combat, have no stomach for melee. They expect that

elves would fall like leaves in an autumn windstorm once

the battle becomes the work of sword and axe rather than

arrow and spell. These warriors have never encountered a

champion of Corellon Larethian.

The champion of Corellon is a noble elf fighter, an elf

knight or lord who can stand up to any orc or human

warrior. All elves admire the grace, discipline, and skill

necessary to become a swordmaster, and the champion

of Corellon is the very paragon of elven swordsmanship.

Clad in shining elven mail or plate, the champion relies on

quickness, agility, and an almost scholarly study of the most

difcult and advanced techniques of swordplay instead of

brute power.

As the name suggests, a champion of Corellon Larethian

holds a special place in elf society. Large temples of Corellon

Larethian often host groups of champions who serve as elite

temple  guards,  advisors  and  bodyguards  to  elf  rulers,  and

questing knights in the service of the whole elf race.

BECOMING A CHAMPION

OF CORELLON

In order to become a champion of Corellon, an elf must

excel in swordplay and exhibit patience, grace, and compas-

sion. Even in the most desperate of times, elves do not judge

a warrior merely by her martial skill. To take joy only in

feats of arms is to live a crude and diminished life. There

is more to life than ghting well, and the true champion

knows this.

The quickest way to become a champion of Corellon

Larethian is to advance as a ghter, due to the difcult feat

requirements. However, a level of cleric, paladin, or rogue

(preferably paladin, because it maximizes your base attack

bonus) will be quite useful in meeting the skill require-

ments. The champion of Corellon class offers no spellcasting

advancement,  so  you  will  not  receive  much  benefit  for

entering this prestige class after advancing primarily as

a spellcaster.

the same sorts of nefarious deeds that other evil spellcasters

engage in.

EL 13: Edrec believes that humans are the most danger-

ous plague ever to blight his beloved forests because of

their voracious appetite for land to clear, timber to cut, and

furs to sell. He wages a bitter and lonely war against all the

human settlements nearby, killing farmers, woodcutters,

and trappers without a word of warning. Edrec has come

to believe that no tactic or weapon is too foul to use against

humans, so he gathers monsters of all kinds to attack human

settlements  and  travelers.  He  is  allied  to  Yeshelvarra,  a

young adult green dragon who gladly collects the plunder

of Edrecs attacks. The PCs might stumble across one of

Edrecs rampaging dire animals, or perhaps human villagers

beg the PCs to aid them against the dark and angry forest

power that besets them.

CHAMPION OF

CORELLON LARETHIAN

When an arrow will not sufce, when no spell will overcome, a

stout heart and a sharp blade may prevail. With Corellons grace,

I fear no foe who stands within reach of my sword.

Many evil warriors believe that elves, while dangerous in

ranged combat, have no stomach for melee. They expect that

elves would fall like leaves in an autumn windstorm once

the battle becomes the work of sword and axe rather than

arrow and spell. These warriors have never encountered a

champion of Corellon Larethian.

The champion of Corellon is a noble elf fighter, an elf

knight or lord who can stand up to any orc or human

warrior. All elves admire the grace, discipline, and skill

necessary to become a swordmaster, and the champion

of Corellon is the very paragon of elven swordsmanship.

Clad in shining elven mail or plate, the champion relies on

quickness, agility, and an almost scholarly study of the most

difcult and advanced techniques of swordplay instead of

brute power.

As the name suggests, a champion of Corellon Larethian

holds a special place in elf society. Large temples of Corellon

Larethian often host groups of champions who serve as elite

temple  guards,  advisors  and  bodyguards  to  elf  rulers,  and

questing knights in the service of the whole elf race.

BECOMING A CHAMPION

OF CORELLON

In order to become a champion of Corellon, an elf must

excel in swordplay and exhibit patience, grace, and compas-

sion. Even in the most desperate of times, elves do not judge

a warrior merely by her martial skill. To take joy only in

feats of arms is to live a crude and diminished life. There

is more to life than ghting well, and the true champion

knows this.

The quickest way to become a champion of Corellon

Larethian is to advance as a ghter, due to the difcult feat

requirements. However, a level of cleric, paladin, or rogue

(preferably paladin, because it maximizes your base attack

bonus) will be quite useful in meeting the skill require-

ments. The champion of Corellon class offers no spellcasting

advancement,  so  you  will  not  receive  much  benefit  for

entering this prestige class after advancing primarily as

a spellcaster.

CLASS FEATURES

Champions of Corellon continue to improve their combat

skills as they advance in level, learning bonus ghter feats

and special techniques for making use of heavier armor than

that favored by most elves.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: You gain no prociency

with any weapon or armor.

Corellons  Blessing  (Su):  Upon  entering  this  class,

you gain the ability to heal wounds by touch, much like a

paladins lay on hands ability. Each day you can heal a total

number of hit points of damage equal to your champion

level  your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). For example,

a 6th-level champion of Corellon with a Charisma score of

14 can heal 12 points of damage per day. You can choose

to  divide  the  healing  among  multiple  recipients,  and

you dont have to do it all at once. Using this ability is a

standard action.

You can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage

to undead creatures. Using Corellons blessing in this way

requires a successful melee touch attack and doesnt provoke

attacks of opportunity. You decide how much of your daily

allotment  of  healing  to  use  as  damage  after  successfully

touching your undead foe.

If you have levels in paladin, you add your levels of cham-

pion of Corellon and paladin together and determine your

ability to heal accordingly (although if you have a Charisma

score of lower than 12, your paladin levels do not contribute

to your ability to heal).

Bonus Feat: At 1st level and every three levels thereafter,

you gain a bonus feat. This must be a feat noted as a bonus

ghter feat, and the feat must have Combat Expertise, Dodge,

or Mounted Combat as a prerequisite.

Elegant Strike (Ex): Upon reaching 2nd level, you become

able to place your attacks where they deal greater damage. You

apply your Dexterity bonus as a bonus on damage rolls (in

addition to any Strength bonus you may have) with any of the

following weapons: longsword, rapier, elven thinblade, elven

lightblade, elven court sword, or scimitar. Targets immune to

sneak attacks or extra damage from critical hits are immune

to your elegant strike.

Superior Defense (Ex): At 3rd level, you learn special

techniques for making the best use of an elfs natural agil-

ity even while wearing restrictive armor. The maximum

Dexterity bonus for any medium or heavy armor you wear

(including mithral versions) is increased by 1. For example,

full  plate  armor  normally  has  a  maximum  Dexterity

bonus of +1, but the superior defense ability increases this

to +2.

At 6th level, you improve the maximum Dexterity bonus

of medium or heavy armor by 2 and at 9th level by 3.

Unimpeded Movement (Ex): At 5th level, you no longer

reduce  your  movement  when  wearing  medium  or  heavy

armor. (You still reduce your movement if carrying a medium

or heavy load, however.)

If  you  know  the  Spring  Attack  feat,  your  unimpeded

movement ability allows you to use Spring Attack even while

wearing heavy armor.

Corellons Wrath (Su): At 8th level, you gain the ability

to briey channel the divine power of Corellon Larethian,

enveloping one melee weapon you wield in a veil of incan-

descent light as a free action. You gain a +2 sacred bonus

on attack rolls and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage with

each melee attack you make with the affected weapon for

1 round. While Corellons wrath is in effect, the weapon is

considered magic and good-aligned for the purpose of over-

coming damage reduction. You can use this ability a number

of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modier (minimum

once per day).

EX-CHAMPIONS OF CORELLON

Few champions of Corellon ever turn to evil, but it occasion-

ally happens. If your alignment changes to evil, you are

expelled from the order and lose the supernatural abilities

derived from this class (Corellons blessing and Corellons

wrath). However, you are not barred from gaining more levels

in this class if you so desire. You can continue to rene the

combat techniques you have learned, but you cannot make

use of the classs supernatural abilities.

PLAYING A CHAMPION

OF CORELLON

You are a noble and courageous warrior. While you espouse

a personal code that bears some resemblance to the chivalric

tradition  of  a  human  knight,  you  bring  a  uniquely  elven

perspective  to  the  concepts  of  honor,  valor,  delity,  and

truthfulness. Specically, you are not under any obligation

to prove your personal bravery by declining advantages that

would help you to defeat a foe or by rashly attacking enemies

superior to you. If you had not proved your valor already, you

would not be a champion of Corellon; your sacred trust is to

defend the innocent, the weak, and the elf people in the most

expedient and effective way you can. Consequently, you do

not scorn the bow, the spell, or the ruse of war when such

things are called for.

You know that once you strike a blow you cannot undo it,

even if it later proves to have been a mistake. Therefore, you

are slow to strike and deliberate in your actions and words

until it is clear that combat is the best response to a particular

challenge. When blood must be spilled, you will do so quickly

and expertly. You do not enjoy killing, but you take pride in

doing it well when it must be done.

Remember, life is not one continuous battle, and you should

not diminish yourself by dening your entire existence as

empty perfection behind your blade. You appreciate many

ne thingsart, literature, beauty, good company, laughter,

and love. Sometimes hope and heart are the best weapons

against evil.

Combat

You ght with skill and special maneuvers, not brute power.

Your best attribute is your Armor Classyou win ghts by

avoiding damage. Combine your Combat Expertise feat with

heavy armor and a shield, and youll be hard to hit indeed,

especially  after  your  superior  defense  ability  kicks  in.  If

youre facing a tough foe, think about using your Combat

Expertise aggressively in conjunction with ghting defen-

sively to occupy your enemy while your companions wear

him down.

Your best weapon choice is probably the elven thinblade.

Its better than a longsword, and you can use Weapon Finesse

to make yourself into a very effective Dexterity-based ghter

instead of a Strength-based ghter.

Resources

Temples  to  Corellon  Larethian  can  be  found  in  almost

any  elf  town  or  city,  and  even  small  forest  settlements

are likely to have at least a shrine dedicated to the Creator

of the Elves. Clerics of Corellon regard you as a staunch

friend and ally, and they will go out of their way to aid you

in whatever fashion they can. As long as there arent other

demands  on  their  spellcasting  services,  you  can  obtain

spells from these temples at no cost unless the spells in

question demand an expensive material component or an

experience  point  expenditure,  in  which  case  the  cleric

in  question  expects  you  to  provide  the  component  or

compensate him appropriately for the experience points

he must spend.

In  addition  to  the  clerics,  the  other  members  of  your

chapter share your skills and interests. They can often be

persuaded to join you in an important quest or to attend to

some matter that you cannot deal with yourself because other

affairs demand your attention. Of course, you may in turn

be asked to help a fellow champion from time to time in the

same way.

CHAMPIONS OF CORELLON

IN THE WORLD

As  some  of  the  most  capable  fighters  found  among  elf

communities, champions of Corellon can often be found

in three common situationsas elite guards to elf rulers,

mages, or clerics; as commanders and leaders in elf armies;

and as crusaders outside the elf homelands, working hard

to counter the efforts of those the elves consider enemies.

When you need an elf swordmaster to serve as an ally to

the PCs, as a guard to an important elf NPC, or even an

honorable lord to rule an elf city, a champion of Corellon

is a good choice.

Champions of Corellon bear a strong resemblance to elf

ghters or elf paladins, and most strangers do not recognize a

member of the prestige class as anything other than a skillful

elf warrior.

Advancement

Organization

In order to become a champion of Corellon, you must start

down a road that leads to some of the most interesting and

powerful feats in the gameSpring Attack and Whirlwind

Attack.  You  should  denitely  consider  making  your  next

three feat choices Mobility, Spring Attack, and Whirlwind

Attack.  You  should  also  think  about  Improved  Disarm,

Improved Feint, and Improved Critical (which works very

well with the elven thinblade).

Your class abilities are at their best when you commit to

wearing the best heavy armor you can afford. At your rst

opportunity, upgrade to mithral full plate armor. Its expen-

sive, but you will appreciate the increase in your maximum

Dexterity bonus and your movement rate, especially if you

picked up Spring Attack.

Naturally, champions of Corellon are strongly afliated with

temples dedicated to Corellons worship. Collectively, they

comprise an order of religious warriors known to the elves

as  the  Aelavellin  Corellonliterally,  the  Sword  Knights  of

Corellon. Each temple of sufcient size (generally, any temple

in a small town or larger community) hosts a chapter of the

Aelavellin, which consists of anywhere from one to a dozen

or more champions in the largest temples.

While the chapters are afliated with the temples of Corel-

lon, the individual champions are not under the command

of the clerics of Corellon or even higher-ranking members

of the order. Champions of Corellon generally hold other

responsibilities in the community, serving as watch captains,

royal advisors, and so on. Meetings of each chapter are cer-

emonial in nature, conducted for purposes of companionship

and consideration of civic issues. The Aelavellin Corellon has

compensate him appropriately for the experience points

he must spend.

In  addition  to  the  clerics,  the  other  members  of  your

chapter share your skills and interests. They can often be

persuaded to join you in an important quest or to attend to

some matter that you cannot deal with yourself because other

affairs demand your attention. Of course, you may in turn

be asked to help a fellow champion from time to time in the

same way.

CHAMPIONS OF CORELLON

IN THE WORLD

As  some  of  the  most  capable  fighters  found  among  elf

communities, champions of Corellon can often be found

in three common situationsas elite guards to elf rulers,

mages, or clerics; as commanders and leaders in elf armies;

and as crusaders outside the elf homelands, working hard

to counter the efforts of those the elves consider enemies.

When you need an elf swordmaster to serve as an ally to

the PCs, as a guard to an important elf NPC, or even an

honorable lord to rule an elf city, a champion of Corellon

is a good choice.

Champions of Corellon bear a strong resemblance to elf

ghters or elf paladins, and most strangers do not recognize a

member of the prestige class as anything other than a skillful

elf warrior.

Advancement

Organization

In order to become a champion of Corellon, you must start

down a road that leads to some of the most interesting and

powerful feats in the gameSpring Attack and Whirlwind

Attack.  You  should  denitely  consider  making  your  next

three feat choices Mobility, Spring Attack, and Whirlwind

Attack.  You  should  also  think  about  Improved  Disarm,

Improved Feint, and Improved Critical (which works very

well with the elven thinblade).

Your class abilities are at their best when you commit to

wearing the best heavy armor you can afford. At your rst

opportunity, upgrade to mithral full plate armor. Its expen-

sive, but you will appreciate the increase in your maximum

Dexterity bonus and your movement rate, especially if you

picked up Spring Attack.

Naturally, champions of Corellon are strongly afliated with

temples dedicated to Corellons worship. Collectively, they

comprise an order of religious warriors known to the elves

as  the  Aelavellin  Corellonliterally,  the  Sword  Knights  of

Corellon. Each temple of sufcient size (generally, any temple

in a small town or larger community) hosts a chapter of the

Aelavellin, which consists of anywhere from one to a dozen

or more champions in the largest temples.

While the chapters are afliated with the temples of Corel-

lon, the individual champions are not under the command

of the clerics of Corellon or even higher-ranking members

of the order. Champions of Corellon generally hold other

responsibilities in the community, serving as watch captains,

royal advisors, and so on. Meetings of each chapter are cer-

emonial in nature, conducted for purposes of companionship

and consideration of civic issues. The Aelavellin Corellon has

CHAMPION OF CORELLON LORE

Characters with Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nobil-

ity  and  royalty)  can  research  the  champions  of  Corellon

Larethian to learn more about them. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following material,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Some powerful elf lords or knights are dedicated

to the service of Corellon Larethian. They are known as

champions of Corellon.

DC  15:  Any  large  temple  dedicated  to  Corellon

Larethian is likely to be home to one or more champions.

They  are  elite  guards,  agents,  and  troubleshooters  for

elven  realms,  often  embarking  on  quests  to  advance

causes important to elves or defend the elven people.

They dont like to start  ghts, but when violence

becomes necessary you wont  nd a more skillful

or determined opponent.

DC  20:  Champions  of  Corellon  are  highly

skilled swordmasters. Few can match their ability

with the blade. They are expert melee  ghters and

often wear heavier armor than most elves do. They possess

some paladinlike abilities and strive to be just, honorable,

and courageous.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about speci c chapters or champions

in your campaign.

Finding a champion of Corellon is not terribly dif cult,

provided one knows where to  nd a good-sized temple of

Corellon Larethian or an elf town or city. Once the PCs

have found an appropriate site, they can establish contact

with a chapter of champions by making a DC 10 Gather

Information check. If, for some reason, they wish to meet

a  champion  without  going  through  elf  intermediaries  or

without approaching the clerics of Corellon Larethian, the

DC increases to 25. Elf PCs gain a +5 circumstance bonus on

these Gather Information checks.

CHAMPIONS OF CORELLON

IN THE GAME

Any elf warrior of suf cient skill might turn out to be a

champion of Corellon Larethian. Champions of Corellon

make excellent NPC allies who might aid the PCs against

a threat the elves consider important, or the ruler of an elf

town might be a champion herself.

The great majority of champions are good. However, some

embark on this path only to later fall into darkness or evil.

Some allow their hatred for enemies or rivals of the elven

folk to overcome them and become cold and remorseless

killers. Others are enamored by the lure of power and seek

to rule over their fellows. Few elf realms are subject to the

same sort of bitter power struggles that often erupt in human

kingdoms, but even elves are not immune to bitterly contested

successions or clan rivalries, and an embittered ex-champion

is often at the heart of such trouble.

The champion of Corellon prestige class appeals to play-

ers who like playing smart  ghters who possess a number of

tactics at their disposal, thanks to a broad and sophisticated

selection of feats. While she might not match a  ghter built

purely for in icting damage, a champion has more options

at her disposal and can be just as effective (or more effec-

tive, in many cases) than a simple Strength-based  ghter

in many situations.

Adaptation

You can easily adapt the champion of Corellon to the service

of almost any other deity, or even another race altogether. The

basic premise of the class (a Dexterity-based  ghter with some

divine powers) lends itself to association with any number of

deities. A human order of champions in the service of Pelor,

for instance, could use the champion of Corellon class with

very little alteration.

Encounters

Champions of Corellon Larethian are rarely found in vil-

lainous roles, although it is always possible that a PC party

acting in ignorance might inadvertently pose a threat to

an elf communityfor example, by exploring a dungeon

in  whose  sealed  chambers  some  dangerous  monster  lies

imprisoned. While most champions are slow to draw their

swords against folk who are not clearly evil, the possibility

for a tragic misunderstanding is still present.

EL  13:  A  doppelganger  assumes  the  guise  of  one  of

the PCs and assassinates an elf diplomat in a human city.

Alissera Berothar, a champion of Corellon, sets out to bring

the PC to justice, unaware that he is innocent. She waits for

an opportunity to catch the PC alone and does her best to

avoid killing the character; she wants to bring him to trial

in elf lands, not execute him in the streets. Alissera can

be persuaded of the characters innocence if she is given

an opportunity to question the PC with the bene t of a

discern lies or zone of truth spell cast by an impartial cleric,

through other magical means that establish the truth of

the matter, or by reputable authority  gures who provide

an alibi.

Languages: Common, Elven; Orc.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Alissera deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or

 anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to

ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures

with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits

are  all  immune  to  sneak  attacks.  Alissera  may  choose  to

deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only

when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a

sap (blackjack).

Elegant  Strike  (Ex):  Alissera  applies  her  Dexterity

bonus as a bonus on damage rolls (already figured into the

statistics given above) with any of the following weapons:

longsword,  rapier,  elven  thinblade,  elven  lightblade,

elven court sword, or scimitar. Targets immune to sneak

attacks or extra damage from critical hits are immune to

her elegant strike.

Elf Traits: Elves have immunity to magic sleep effects. An

elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed

door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she where

actively looking for it.

Superior Defense (Ex): Alissera increases the maximum

Dexterity bonus for any medium or heavy armor she wears

by 1.

Trap  nding  (Ex):  Alissera  can   nd,  disarm,  or  bypass

traps  with  a  DC  of  20  or  higher.  She  can  use  the  Search

skill to  nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

she discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Unimpeded Movement (Ex): Alissera does not reduce

her speed when she wears medium or heavy armor. She can

use her Spring Attack feat even while wearing heavy armor.

Possessions: +2 mithral full plate armor, +2 heavy steel shield,

+1 ring of protection, +1 silvered keen elven thinblade, master-

Alissera Berothar,

a champion of Corellon

a command hierarchy of sorts, and on rare occasions (a great

battle, for instance) the champions assemble as an elite guard,

serving as the armored heart of an elf army. In practice, a

champion of Corellon never has to weigh the dictates of the

order against her personal responsibilities to her home, ruler,

or family.

A champion is welcome among any chapter she encounters

in her travels and free to leave a chapter whenever her duties

or desires lead her to move on.

NPC Reactions

Champions of Corellon are indistinguishable from any other

elf  ghters, at least in the eyes of nonelves, and therefore

receive much the same reaction from others. Those who

would be disposed to be friendly toward elves will likewise

be friendly to champions of Corellon Larethian, and those

who regard elves as enemies certainly feel no differently

about champions of elf deities.

If it is possible for an orc to hate an elf more than orcs

generally hate elves, clerics of Gruumsh despise any cleric or

servant of Corellon Larethian beyond all reason. Gruumsh

worshipers sometimes launch suicidal attacks in the hope

of killing a servant of Corellon.

LUCKSTEALER

Want riches beyond measure? Just make sure youre there when

the other guys luck runs out.

Mik Cobblethrush, luckstealer with the haling

Four Hands caravan.

As a luckstealer, youre part spellcaster, part professional

gamblerand 100% mischief-maker. Youre the haling who

eeces local card sharps out of their hard-earned gold, then

disappears in a puff of smoke when the swords come out. Not

that you ee, of courseyoure just moving to the perfect

ambush spot and signaling the rest of your caravan to rob the

town treasury while the locals are busy ghting you.

BECOMING A LUCKSTEALER

Luckstealers are spellcasters, so the easiest way to get into the

prestige class is to take levels in wizard or sorcerer. Wizards

have more skill points due to their high Intelligence, so its

a little easier for them to buy ranks in Profession (gambler).

A sorcerer is a better match for this prestige class because

some of its skills and class features rely on Charisma. Clerics

with the Luck domain also qualify for the luckstealer class,

but the low hit points and poor base attack bonus make the

prestige class less attractive to them. Bards also qualify for the

luckstealer prestige class easily, but the class doesnt enhance

their existing abilities.

Entry Requirements

Race: Halfling.

Skills: Profession (gambler) 9 ranks.

Feats: Dallah Thauns Luck (see page 149).

Spells: Ability to cast 3rd-level arcane or divine spells.

Domain: Luck (divine spellcasters only).

CLASS FEATURES

As a luckstealer, your spellcasting progression slows down

a bit, but you gain two useful curse abilities, class features

that  have  an  element  of  gambling  to  them,  and  some

magical  techniques  that  help  you  work  your  mischief  at

the gaming table.

Spellcasting: At each level indicated on Table 53, you

gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and

spells  known,  if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a

level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before

adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain

any other class feature a character of that class would have

gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before

becoming a luckstealer, you must decide to which class to

add each level for the purpose of determining spells per

day, caster level, and spells known.

Curse  of  the  Fatespurned  (Sp):  By  staring  at  a  living

opponent for a moment (a move action), you can steal a bit

of his or her luck for yourself. Your target must succeed on

a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modier) or

take a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and

skill checks for 1 minute. The curse of the fatespurned has a

range of 60 feet. The effect cannot be dispelled, but it can

be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle,

remove curse, or wish spell.

Your  cursed  enemys  bad  fortune  is  your  good  fortune.

Whenever you successfully use curse of the fatespurned, you

gain 2 points for your luck pool. You can spend points from

your luck pool on a 1-for-1 basis to gain a luck bonus on any

attack roll, ability check, skill check, or saving throw you

make. You decide how many points youre spending before

you make the roll. You can also use points from your luck pool

to power your desperate recall and fates proof class features

(described below).

Unspent points remain in your luck pool for 1 minute. You

cant have more points in your luck pool than your Charisma

modier (minimum 1). You retain the good fortune (and the

points in your luck pool) even if your enemy uses remove curse

or another spell to remove his or her bad luck.

Subtle Magic (Su): The spells you cast often dont register

to divination magic. If a divination is attempted against one

of your spells, the caster of the divination must succeed on

a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 +

your caster level. The subtle magic class feature covers only

your spells; the magic items you possess still register normally

to detect magic and other spells.

you cast enervation, you can reroll the 1d4 to determine how

many negative levels the spell bestows. If you cast a 15d6

delayed blast reball, you can reroll any three of the fteen

dice. You must take the results of the new rolls, even if

theyre worse.

Desperate Recall (Su): At 4th level and higher, you can

recover the energy from a spell you just cast, but doing so

costs you a bit of the luck you have accumulated. Once per

day, as a move action, you can recall any one spell that you

had prepared and then cast (if you prepare spells ahead of

time) or the energy from one spell slot (if you cast spells

spontaneously). The spell or spell slot is then ready for use

again, just as if it had not been cast. At 7th level, you can

use desperate recall twice per day, and at 10th level, you

can use it three times a day.

Whenever  you  use

the desperate recall

class  feature,  you

have  to  pay  lucks

cost: 1 point from

your  luck  pool

for  a  1st-  to  3rd-

level spell, 2 points

for  a  4th-  to  6th-

level  spells-, and 3

points for a 7th- to

9th-level spell. If

you cant afford to

pay lucks cost, you

can  instead  lose

any luck points you

have  in  your  pool

and  give  up  a

measure of your

own personal good fortune: For 1 min-

ute, you take a 1 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, ability

checks, and skill checks, and a 1 penalty to your Armor

Class. This penalty stacks with itself and with penalties

from the fates proof class feature and the Dallah Thauns

Luck feat.

Curse of the Black Cloud (Sp): At 7th level and higher,

you can manipulate the threads of fate itself, causing a thin

black cloud to descend over your foes and steal their luck

away. This ability functions like the curse of the fatespurned

class feature, except that the black cloud curses everyone

within  a  20-foot  spread.  The  cloud  doesnt  affect  vision,

and it naturally disperses a round after you use this class

feature. At 10th level, you can use this class feature twice

a day.

As with curse of the fatespurned, you get the good luck that

your enemies lose. You gain 2 points for your luck pool for

each living creature that suffers the curse of the black cloud.

The luck pools maximum size is equal to your Charisma

modier (minimum 1). As described in the curse of the fate-

spurned class feature, you can use points from your luck pool

to improve your rolls or to use the desperate recall or fates

proof class features.

Fates Proof (Su): At 10th level, you have a sense of fate

that borders on the precognitive. You gain occasional ashes

of insight when youre in danger. For example, in the middle

of a battle you might receive an instantaneous vision of a

troll rending you limb from limb. By ducking and evading

the trolls outstretched claws, youre able to avert a grisly fate.

You can use this ability to avoid critical hits, poison attempts,

and other particularly dangerous attacks.

Three times per day, you can force an opponent to reroll an

attack roll, or you can reroll a save youve failed. Announce

your decision to do so after you know the full effects of your

bad fortune: how much damage the attack deals, the conse-

quences of the failed save, or secondary effects such as poison

or improved grab. When you use the

fates proof class feature, the attack

begins  again  from  the  moment

of the attack roll, and the spell

or other condition that forced

you to make a save begins again

from the moment you attempt the

save.  You  must  accept  the

result  of  the  reroll,  even

if  its  worse  than  the

original  result.  You

cant use fates proof

more than once on

the same roll.

PLAYING A LUCKSTEALER

You are nely attuned to the ebb and ow of probability, and

you love to play the oddsor better yet, stack them in your

favor. Tempting fate comes naturally to you. Whether across

a  card  table  or  on  the  eld  of  battle,  your  enemies  wince

whenever they have to face you. They know that youll take

any good fortune they have and replace it with bad luckand

bad luck is the one attack no one can defend against.

LUCKSTEALER

Want riches beyond measure? Just make sure youre there when

the other guys luck runs out.

Mik Cobblethrush, luckstealer with the haling

Four Hands caravan.

As a luckstealer, youre part spellcaster, part professional

gamblerand 100% mischief-maker. Youre the haling who

eeces local card sharps out of their hard-earned gold, then

disappears in a puff of smoke when the swords come out. Not

that you ee, of courseyoure just moving to the perfect

ambush spot and signaling the rest of your caravan to rob the

town treasury while the locals are busy ghting you.

BECOMING A LUCKSTEALER

Luckstealers are spellcasters, so the easiest way to get into the

prestige class is to take levels in wizard or sorcerer. Wizards

have more skill points due to their high Intelligence, so its

a little easier for them to buy ranks in Profession (gambler).

A sorcerer is a better match for this prestige class because

some of its skills and class features rely on Charisma. Clerics

with the Luck domain also qualify for the luckstealer class,

but the low hit points and poor base attack bonus make the

prestige class less attractive to them. Bards also qualify for the

luckstealer prestige class easily, but the class doesnt enhance

their existing abilities.

Entry Requirements

Race: Halfling.

Skills: Profession (gambler) 9 ranks.

Feats: Dallah Thauns Luck (see page 149).

Spells: Ability to cast 3rd-level arcane or divine spells.

Domain: Luck (divine spellcasters only).

CLASS FEATURES

As a luckstealer, your spellcasting progression slows down

a bit, but you gain two useful curse abilities, class features

that  have  an  element  of  gambling  to  them,  and  some

magical  techniques  that  help  you  work  your  mischief  at

the gaming table.

Spellcasting: At each level indicated on Table 53, you

gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and

spells  known,  if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a

level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before

adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain

any other class feature a character of that class would have

gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before

becoming a luckstealer, you must decide to which class to

add each level for the purpose of determining spells per

day, caster level, and spells known.

Curse  of  the  Fatespurned  (Sp):  By  staring  at  a  living

opponent for a moment (a move action), you can steal a bit

of his or her luck for yourself. Your target must succeed on

a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modier) or

take a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and

skill checks for 1 minute. The curse of the fatespurned has a

range of 60 feet. The effect cannot be dispelled, but it can

be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle,

remove curse, or wish spell.

Your  cursed  enemys  bad  fortune  is  your  good  fortune.

Whenever you successfully use curse of the fatespurned, you

gain 2 points for your luck pool. You can spend points from

your luck pool on a 1-for-1 basis to gain a luck bonus on any

attack roll, ability check, skill check, or saving throw you

make. You decide how many points youre spending before

you make the roll. You can also use points from your luck pool

to power your desperate recall and fates proof class features

(described below).

Unspent points remain in your luck pool for 1 minute. You

cant have more points in your luck pool than your Charisma

modier (minimum 1). You retain the good fortune (and the

points in your luck pool) even if your enemy uses remove curse

or another spell to remove his or her bad luck.

Subtle Magic (Su): The spells you cast often dont register

to divination magic. If a divination is attempted against one

of your spells, the caster of the divination must succeed on

a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 +

your caster level. The subtle magic class feature covers only

your spells; the magic items you possess still register normally

to detect magic and other spells.

Lucky  Magic  (Su):  When  you  reach  4th  level,  good

fortune infuses the spells you cast. Whenever you cast a

spell that has a variable, numeric effect, you can reroll one

die out of every ve (minimum one reroll). For example, if

you cast enervation, you can reroll the 1d4 to determine how

many negative levels the spell bestows. If you cast a 15d6

delayed blast reball, you can reroll any three of the fteen

dice. You must take the results of the new rolls, even if

theyre worse.

Desperate Recall (Su): At 4th level and higher, you can

recover the energy from a spell you just cast, but doing so

costs you a bit of the luck you have accumulated. Once per

day, as a move action, you can recall any one spell that you

had prepared and then cast (if you prepare spells ahead of

time) or the energy from one spell slot (if you cast spells

spontaneously). The spell or spell slot is then ready for use

again, just as if it had not been cast. At 7th level, you can

use desperate recall twice per day, and at 10th level, you

can use it three times a day.

Whenever  you  use

the desperate recall

class  feature,  you

have  to  pay  lucks

cost: 1 point from

your  luck  pool

for  a  1st-  to  3rd-

level spell, 2 points

for  a  4th-  to  6th-

level  spells-, and 3

points for a 7th- to

9th-level spell. If

you cant afford to

pay lucks cost, you

can  instead  lose

any luck points you

have  in  your  pool

and  give  up  a

measure of your

own personal good fortune: For 1 min-

ute, you take a 1 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, ability

checks, and skill checks, and a 1 penalty to your Armor

Class. This penalty stacks with itself and with penalties

from the fates proof class feature and the Dallah Thauns

Luck feat.

Curse of the Black Cloud (Sp): At 7th level and higher,

you can manipulate the threads of fate itself, causing a thin

black cloud to descend over your foes and steal their luck

away. This ability functions like the curse of the fatespurned

class feature, except that the black cloud curses everyone

within  a  20-foot  spread.  The  cloud  doesnt  affect  vision,

and it naturally disperses a round after you use this class

feature. At 10th level, you can use this class feature twice

a day.

As with curse of the fatespurned, you get the good luck that

your enemies lose. You gain 2 points for your luck pool for

each living creature that suffers the curse of the black cloud.

The luck pools maximum size is equal to your Charisma

modier (minimum 1). As described in the curse of the fate-

spurned class feature, you can use points from your luck pool

to improve your rolls or to use the desperate recall or fates

proof class features.

Fates Proof (Su): At 10th level, you have a sense of fate

that borders on the precognitive. You gain occasional ashes

of insight when youre in danger. For example, in the middle

of a battle you might receive an instantaneous vision of a

troll rending you limb from limb. By ducking and evading

the trolls outstretched claws, youre able to avert a grisly fate.

You can use this ability to avoid critical hits, poison attempts,

and other particularly dangerous attacks.

Three times per day, you can force an opponent to reroll an

attack roll, or you can reroll a save youve failed. Announce

your decision to do so after you know the full effects of your

bad fortune: how much damage the attack deals, the conse-

quences of the failed save, or secondary effects such as poison

or improved grab. When you use the

fates proof class feature, the attack

begins  again  from  the  moment

of the attack roll, and the spell

or other condition that forced

you to make a save begins again

from the moment you attempt the

save.  You  must  accept  the

result  of  the  reroll,  even

if  its  worse  than  the

more than once on

the same roll.

Kulya Vashkarath, a luckstealer

the luckstealer title isnt considered pejorative in halfling

culture. The magical techniques that comprise your class

features are well understood by halfling sagesits just

that  not  everyone  shows  the  aptitude  for  or  interest  in

messing with the laws of probability. Your fellow halflings

think of you primarily as a powerful spellcaster and dont

pay too much attention to the literal meaning of your title.

If  someone  threatens  the  safety  or  welfare  of  a

halfling community, the leaders will

often turn to a luckstealer, saying,

Cant you curse our nemesis so

theyll  leave  us  alone?  They

understand the general prin-

ciple behind a luckstealers

abilities,  but  they  usually

dont know the specics.

Combat

For  a  luckstealer,  the

fundamental tactical de-

cision  is  how  to  spend

the luck points you get

with  your  curse  class

features. The luck points

only last for 1 minute, so

its not worth it to hoard

them unless you know

in advance that you have

a  critical  roll  or  check

coming up.

Early  in  a  fight  or  in

a  battle  against  undead,

you  may  be  caught  without

luck points. You can still use

desperate  recall  and  fates  proof,

but you need to balance the penalties

youll accept against the benefits from

an extra spell or possibly thwarting an

enemy attack.

Your curse of the black cloud ability is

the fastest way to get a lot of luck points,

but you have to be careful placing it so you dont steal the

luck of your allies. If you really need the extra spell that

desperate recall will provide, its not necessarily the end of

the world if you steal a little luck from a friend. The penalties

disappear after 1 minute anyway, so your ally might agree

that a critical, party-saving spell might be more important

than a temporary inconvenience. (At least thats how youll

spin it if your friends complain.)

If  youre  a  high-level  luckstealer  facing  a  particularly

dangerous foe, its a good idea to try to get 5 luck points

as soon as you can and keep them. Thats because the fates

proof ability is your best way to thwart certain death. Its

best  used  after  your  enemies  get  lucky,  such  as  when  a

monster scores a critical hit against you or you roll a 1 on

an  easy  but  important  saving  throw.  Fates  proof  is  less

useful when average dice results did you in, because its

likely that your enemy will be able to repeat the success

during the reroll.

Advancement

Usually a wizened mentor teaches the magical techniques

that make up the luckstealers class features to a promising

but mischievous student in the haling community. The

techniques  are  straightforward  but  delicate,  so

the mentor demonstrates them and teaches

a series of exercises that hone the students

ability to manipulate fate and fortune.

Once a mentor has taught these exer-

cises, a young luckstealer requires no

further instruction.

However,  knowing  how  luck-

stealing works and actually being

able to pull it off are two different

things. It takes countless hours

of practice to master the delicate

ebb and ow of probability for

the luckstealers art. When you

use rst send a curse of the black

cloud against your enemies, it

doesnt represent something

youve  just  learned.  Youve

been attempting the curse of

the  black  cloud  for  months  or

years,  and  this  is  just  the  rst

time it worked.

Once you become a luckstealer,

your other character-advancement

choices are relatively straightforward.

If you were a wizard before you became

a  luckstealer,  use  magic  to  improve

your Charisma score. Dont neglect

Intelligence, obviously, but make

Charisma  a  priority.  If  youre

a  sorcerer,  consider  spells  that  have  variable

effects so you can get the full benet of your

lucky magic class feature.

Resources

There is no secret society of luckstealers, but most haling

communities recognize that its useful to have a powerful

spellcaster in their midst. A luckstealer on the run can

almost always count on safe refuge among halings, wholl

hide him and provide what other aid they can spare. Temples

dedicated to Olidammara also treat luckstealers wellif

theyve heard of them.

LUCKSTEALERS IN THE WORLD

From a DMs standpoint, the luckstealer is a good pres-

tige class to offer a player who has a natural mischievous

streakand  to  use  for  a  frustrating,  hard-to-pin-down

nemesis for PCs.

A luckstealers curse of the black cloud

descends on a hobgoblin

Organization

Luckstealers dont have an organized group or an agenda

beyond  that  of  their  halfling  caravans.  Because  a  luck-

stealer  is  a  charismatic,  powerful  spellcaster,  such  a

character is almost always an influential member of the

community. A luckstealer is sometimes an instigator of

criminal schemes cooked up by less respectable halflings;

many are the ringleaders of roving thieves guilds. Other

luckstealers  lead  caravans  of  their  own  or  act  as  senior

advisors to a community leader. Pulling strings from behind

the  scenes  is  a  common  tactic  for  luckstealers  because

theyre personable, good bluffers, and able to use spells

surreptitiously  to  good  effect  with  their  subtle  magic

class feature.

Some luckstealers spend their days working on their next

scheme, setting up the big folk for another humiliating loss at

the hands of the halings. Others take a day-to-day approach

to  life,  relying  on  fate  to  bring  them  one  adventure  after

another. Theyre rarely disappointed.

Many  luckstealers  venerate  Dallah  Thaun,  but  their

relationship with clerics of the halfling goddess can be

complicated.  Recently,  clerics  of  Dallah  Thaun  have  been

trying to bring luckstealers under their wing, granting them

high station in the church in exchange for magical aid and a

measure of control. Some luckstealers are stubbornly inde-

pendent, spurning the advances of the church even if they

are worshipers of Dallah Thaun. Other luckstealers wonder

whether the luckstealing techniques werent really Dallah

Thauns to begin with, and theyre more willing to cast their

lot with Dallah Thauns clergy.

NPC Reactions

Few nonhalflings know about luckstealers, and saying

someone is a luckstealer sounds like a quaint haling way

of describing an unlucky person. Of course, those in the

know  have  denite  opinions  about  powerful  spellcasters

who can twist fate itself.

Most haling caravan leaders have heard of luckstealers,

and few are indifferent toward them. About half of such

leaders regard luckstealers well and have an initial attitude

of friendly. The others have found that trouble follows in

the wake of a luckstealer and have an initial attitude of

unfriendly. Halings who are not part of a communitys

leadership almost always have an initial attitude of friendly

because  many  halfling  folk  tales  feature  a  luckstealer

whos always getting into trouble but escaping by fooling

the big folk.

Luckstealers likewise have few enemies beyond haling

communities.  Rivalries  occasionally  develop  between  a

luckstealer and a cleric of Dallah Thaun, and sometimes

an evil luckstealer will turn on his own caravan. Clerics of

Olidammara  (and  other  gods  with  the  Luck  and  Trickery

domain) tend to think of luckstealers as kindred spirits, when

they have heard of them at all, and have an initial attitude

of friendly.

LUCKSTEALER LORE

Characters with Knowledge (local) can research the luck-

stealers to learn more about them. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs. Halings get a +4 circumstance

bonus  on  the  check  because  luckstealers  are  a  signicant

part of their culture.

DC  10:  Luckstealers  are  spellcasters  who  specialize  in

curse-magic.

DC  15:  A  luckstealer  does  what  it  sayshe  takes  your

luck and uses it to power his magic. A lot of them hide in

haling caravans, stealing peoples good fortune and then

leaving town.

DC 20: A luckstealer can steal peoples luckits a sort

of cursebut the effects dont last very long. Almost all of

them used to be sorcerers.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about specic luckstealers in your

campaign.

A DC 25 Gather Information check is sufcient to set up a

meeting with a luckstealer. Halings get a +4 circumstance

bonus on this check as well, as a luckstealer is more apt to

trust a fellow haling.

LUCKSTEALERS IN THE GAME

Whether its a PC or an NPC, a luckstealer is a good choice

when  you  want  a  slippery  spellcaster  who  always  lives  to

ght another day.

If you have a luckstealer at the table, you can challenge

the PCs by giving them multiple encounters without a rest

break. That will give the luckstealer a chance to use his

desperate recall ability to save the group. Longer battles

also favor a luckstealer, because his curses have a bigger

effect on the game when combat stretches beyond two or

three rounds.

Adaptation

As written, the luckstealer is tied to haling culture, but it

would be a balanced prestige class for any race. It would be

particularly appropriate for spellcasters with a connection to

luck or fatewhether theyre arcane or divine casters. Its also

straightforward to put an evil twist on luckstealers, turning

them into secretive plotters who work secret magic, bring

misfortune, and manipulate fate to their own ends.

Encounters

When you run an encounter with a luckstealer, make sure the

character uses one of the curse abilities (fatespurned or black

cloud) early in the battle. The desperate recall and lucky magic

abilities are interesting in the hands of PCs but invisible to

your players when an NPC luckstealer uses them, so theyre

less important. Like all arcane spellcasters, luckstealers are

physically vulnerable, so they work best when accompanied

by a tough bodyguard.

useful when average dice results did you in, because its

likely that your enemy will be able to repeat the success

during the reroll.

Advancement

Usually a wizened mentor teaches the magical techniques

that make up the luckstealers class features to a promising

but mischievous student in the haling community. The

techniques  are  straightforward  but  delicate,  so

the mentor demonstrates them and teaches

a series of exercises that hone the students

ability to manipulate fate and fortune.

Once a mentor has taught these exer-

cises, a young luckstealer requires no

further instruction.

However,  knowing  how  luck-

stealing works and actually being

able to pull it off are two different

things. It takes countless hours

of practice to master the delicate

ebb and ow of probability for

the luckstealers art. When you

use rst send a curse of the black

cloud against your enemies, it

doesnt represent something

youve  just  learned.  Youve

been attempting the curse of

the  black  cloud  for  months  or

years,  and  this  is  just  the  rst

time it worked.

Once you become a luckstealer,

your other character-advancement

choices are relatively straightforward.

If you were a wizard before you became

a  luckstealer,  use  magic  to  improve

your Charisma score. Dont neglect

Intelligence, obviously, but make

Charisma  a  priority.  If  youre

a  sorcerer,  consider  spells  that  have  variable

effects so you can get the full benet of your

lucky magic class feature.

Resources

There is no secret society of luckstealers, but most haling

communities recognize that its useful to have a powerful

spellcaster in their midst. A luckstealer on the run can

almost always count on safe refuge among halings, wholl

hide him and provide what other aid they can spare. Temples

dedicated to Olidammara also treat luckstealers wellif

theyve heard of them.

LUCKSTEALERS IN THE WORLD

From a DMs standpoint, the luckstealer is a good pres-

tige class to offer a player who has a natural mischievous

streakand  to  use  for  a  frustrating,  hard-to-pin-down

nemesis for PCs.

A luckstealers curse of the black cloud

Organization

Luckstealers dont have an organized group or an agenda

beyond  that  of  their  halfling  caravans.  Because  a  luck-

stealer  is  a  charismatic,  powerful  spellcaster,  such  a

character is almost always an influential member of the

community. A luckstealer is sometimes an instigator of

criminal schemes cooked up by less respectable halflings;

many are the ringleaders of roving thieves guilds. Other

luckstealers  lead  caravans  of  their  own  or  act  as  senior

advisors to a community leader. Pulling strings from behind

the  scenes  is  a  common  tactic  for  luckstealers  because

theyre personable, good bluffers, and able to use spells

surreptitiously  to  good  effect  with  their  subtle  magic

class feature.

Some luckstealers spend their days working on their next

scheme, setting up the big folk for another humiliating loss at

the hands of the halings. Others take a day-to-day approach

to  life,  relying  on  fate  to  bring  them  one  adventure  after

another. Theyre rarely disappointed.

Many  luckstealers  venerate  Dallah  Thaun,  but  their

relationship with clerics of the halfling goddess can be

complicated.  Recently,  clerics  of  Dallah  Thaun  have  been

trying to bring luckstealers under their wing, granting them

high station in the church in exchange for magical aid and a

measure of control. Some luckstealers are stubbornly inde-

pendent, spurning the advances of the church even if they

are worshipers of Dallah Thaun. Other luckstealers wonder

whether the luckstealing techniques werent really Dallah

Thauns to begin with, and theyre more willing to cast their

lot with Dallah Thauns clergy.

NPC Reactions

Few nonhalflings know about luckstealers, and saying

someone is a luckstealer sounds like a quaint haling way

of describing an unlucky person. Of course, those in the

know  have  denite  opinions  about  powerful  spellcasters

who can twist fate itself.

Most haling caravan leaders have heard of luckstealers,

and few are indifferent toward them. About half of such

leaders regard luckstealers well and have an initial attitude

of friendly. The others have found that trouble follows in

the wake of a luckstealer and have an initial attitude of

unfriendly. Halings who are not part of a communitys

leadership almost always have an initial attitude of friendly

because  many  halfling  folk  tales  feature  a  luckstealer

whos always getting into trouble but escaping by fooling

the big folk.

Luckstealers likewise have few enemies beyond haling

communities.  Rivalries  occasionally  develop  between  a

luckstealer and a cleric of Dallah Thaun, and sometimes

an evil luckstealer will turn on his own caravan. Clerics of

Olidammara  (and  other  gods  with  the  Luck  and  Trickery

domain) tend to think of luckstealers as kindred spirits, when

they have heard of them at all, and have an initial attitude

of friendly.

LUCKSTEALER LORE

Characters with Knowledge (local) can research the luck-

stealers to learn more about them. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs. Halings get a +4 circumstance

bonus  on  the  check  because  luckstealers  are  a  signicant

part of their culture.

DC  10:  Luckstealers  are  spellcasters  who  specialize  in

curse-magic.

DC  15:  A  luckstealer  does  what  it  sayshe  takes  your

luck and uses it to power his magic. A lot of them hide in

haling caravans, stealing peoples good fortune and then

leaving town.

DC 20: A luckstealer can steal peoples luckits a sort

of cursebut the effects dont last very long. Almost all of

them used to be sorcerers.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about specic luckstealers in your

campaign.

A DC 25 Gather Information check is sufcient to set up a

meeting with a luckstealer. Halings get a +4 circumstance

bonus on this check as well, as a luckstealer is more apt to

trust a fellow haling.

LUCKSTEALERS IN THE GAME

Whether its a PC or an NPC, a luckstealer is a good choice

when  you  want  a  slippery  spellcaster  who  always  lives  to

ght another day.

If you have a luckstealer at the table, you can challenge

the PCs by giving them multiple encounters without a rest

break. That will give the luckstealer a chance to use his

desperate recall ability to save the group. Longer battles

also favor a luckstealer, because his curses have a bigger

effect on the game when combat stretches beyond two or

three rounds.

Adaptation

As written, the luckstealer is tied to haling culture, but it

would be a balanced prestige class for any race. It would be

particularly appropriate for spellcasters with a connection to

luck or fatewhether theyre arcane or divine casters. Its also

straightforward to put an evil twist on luckstealers, turning

them into secretive plotters who work secret magic, bring

misfortune, and manipulate fate to their own ends.

Encounters

When you run an encounter with a luckstealer, make sure the

character uses one of the curse abilities (fatespurned or black

cloud) early in the battle. The desperate recall and lucky magic

abilities are interesting in the hands of PCs but invisible to

your players when an NPC luckstealer uses them, so theyre

less important. Like all arcane spellcasters, luckstealers are

physically vulnerable, so they work best when accompanied

by a tough bodyguard.

RUATHAR

If you agree to leave the land west of the Dursar River unsettled,

the elves of Veldiri will give you leave to settle in the eastern forest

and answer any call for their aid, should you need it. On this matter

I can speak for the Veldiri.

 Johdur Ter Harak, elf-friend of Veldiri

Also known as elf-friend or star-friend, a ruathar is a person

of some other race who has earned the special friendship

of the elven folk. While many individuals who render the

elf people some notable service are known as elf-friends, a

ruathar is truly blessedthe recipient of a powerful magical

ritual that infuses him with the real and lasting blessing of

the elf race. The elves extend the invitation to become rua-

thars to very few individuals indeed, but those so honored

have a home among the elf people for the rest of their days

if they so desire.

Elves can become ruathars, but such characters are some-

what unusual. An elf becomes a ruathar when he renders

a great service to an elf realm that is not his homeland, or

when one or more of his nonelf companions receive the

honor in recognition for a deed he also shared in. When an

individual elf is singled out for this kind of recognition in

his homeland, he is usually called star-friend rather than

elf-friend.

BECOMING A RUATHAR

Ruathars are expected to be capable of serving as defenders of

the elven people. While many elf-friends render elves service

of great importance through feats of diplomacy, invention,

gift giving, or compassion, only those who are willing and

able to hazard their lives side-to-side with elf warriors are

made into ruathars. Therefore, elves must nd some basic

competence with blade or spell in a potential ruathar before

they consider bestowing the honor of the ritual. Ruathars

must be noteworthy examples of elven values, so they are

often  particularly  keen-eyed,  magically  skilled,  or  well-

spoken individuals.

Special: In addition to meeting one of the three

requirements given above, you must have performed a

great service to an elf community, such as participating

in the defeat of a monster of at least CR 10, recovering a

valuable elven magic item, or risking death in order to save

an elfs life.

CLASS FEATURES

You continue to improve both your skill at arms and your

spellcasting abilities as you advance in level.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: You receive Martial

Weapon Prociency as a bonus feat. You can choose the

longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow),

or shortbow (including composite shortbow). Other than

that,  you  gain  no  proficiency  with  any  type  of  weapon,

armor, or shield.

Spellcasting:  At  each  level,  you  gain  new  spells  per

day  and  an  increase  in  caster  level  (and  spells  known,  if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class

level. You do not, however, gain any other class feature a

character of that class would have gained. If you had more

than  one  spellcasting  class  before  becoming  a  ruathar,

you  must  decide  to  which  class  to  add  each  level  for  the

purpose  of  determining  spells  per  day,  caster  level,  and

spells known.

Word  of  Friendship  (Sp):  You  learn  a  short  magical

phrase that identies you as a ruathar. While anyone can

learn to mouth the words of the phrase, only ruathars are

taught the magical key that makes the phrase more than

just a few words in Elven. This is a sonic, language-depen-

dent effect and is equivalent to a 1st-level spell. The word of

friendship does not inuence the hearers mind in any way,

but all elves know that only ruathars are taught it. Elves

addressed in such a fashion generally begin with an attitude

of friendly or helpful toward you, unless you are obviously

engaged in an evil act.

Gift of the Elves: During the ruathar ceremony, you are

traditionally presented with a gift of elven magic to aid you

in your travels. This gift takes the form of any one of the

following items: boots of elvenkind, cloak of elvenkind, elven

chain, a +1 rapier, a +1 longsword, or a +1 composite longbow

(Strength  bonus  up  to  +4,  as  appropriate  for  you).  The

elves provide whatever gift they deem most useful to you.

If the gift is lost or destroyed, you do not receive another

one. While you are free to give away or sell the gift, good

manners dictate that the gift of the elves should be kept

and treasured.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain low-light

vision. You can see twice as far as a human in conditions of

dim illumination. If you already have low-light vision, you

gain improved low-light vision, and you can now see four

times as far as a human in conditions of dim illumination.

Elfwise (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain the uncanny visual

acuity and senses of the elves. You gain a +2 bonus on Search,

Spot, and Listen checks. (These bonuses stack with an elfs

racial bonuses.)

Star Blessing (Su): At 3rd level, you gain a +1 sacred bonus

on attack rolls and saving throws while under the night sky

(above ground and outside during nighttime).

Arvandors Grace (Ex): When you reach 3rd level, the

love of the elven folk actually changes you, instilling in you

a glimmer of elven agelessness. Your racial life span and the

lower limit of each of your age categories increase by 50%.

If this change places you in a younger age category than you

formerly occupied, you retain any ability score bonuses and

penalties you previously gained for agingyour aging effec-

tively stalls until you cross a threshold into an age category

thats new to you.

For example, a human normally reaches middle age at 35,

old age at 53, and venerable age at 70, and his maximum age

is 2d20 years beyond that. A 3rd-level human ruathar reaches

middle age at 52, old age at 79, venerable age at 105, and has

a maximum age of 3d20 years beyond that. If a 40-year-old

human became a 3rd-level ruathar, his age category would

revert to adult. He would retain the 1 penalty to Strength,

Dexterity,  and  Constitution  he  took  when  he  previously

entered middle age at age 35, as well as the +1 bonus to Intel-

ligence, Wisdom, and Charisma he previously received. He

wouldnt age further until age 79, when he would receive the

bonuses and penalties for old age.

Even  elf  ruathars  can  receive  Arvandors  grace;  such

characters are astonishingly long-lived.

PLAYING A RUATHAR

You have earned a special trust that very few nonelves ever

receive. Above all else, you want to live up to that trust and

make sure that you never abuse it. Its very likely that you

already carry yourself with at least some amount of grace,

compassion, and wisdom. After all, if the elves did not see

in  you  many  of  the  values  and  character  traits  they  hold

praiseworthy, they would not have named you a ruathar.

In dealing with others, be patient and consider long-

term repercussions. As a ruathar, your actions reect on

those elves who honored you as an elf-friend. Do not give

hasty answers or act rashly. You believe, as do the elves,

that many problems are only worsened by taking a quick

and ill-considered response today, when a better answer

might become apparent with a little time. Dont be afraid

to stop and ask yourself: What would my elf friends want

me to do now?

While you admire elven ways and seek to emulate elves in

many respects, one of the things that your elf comrades most

admire in you is the fact that you are not an elf. You often

think of things that would never occur to elves, and some-

times see answers to problems that elves might otherwise

miss. You are at your best when you combine your knowledge

and respect for elven ways with the particular viewpoint of

your own race.

unchanged by taking ruathar levels. If you were a skilled

chain, a +1 rapier, a +1 longsword, or a +1 composite longbow

(Strength  bonus  up  to  +4,  as  appropriate  for  you).  The

elves provide whatever gift they deem most useful to you.

If the gift is lost or destroyed, you do not receive another

one. While you are free to give away or sell the gift, good

manners dictate that the gift of the elves should be kept

and treasured.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain low-light

vision. You can see twice as far as a human in conditions of

dim illumination. If you already have low-light vision, you

gain improved low-light vision, and you can now see four

times as far as a human in conditions of dim illumination.

Elfwise (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain the uncanny visual

acuity and senses of the elves. You gain a +2 bonus on Search,

Spot, and Listen checks. (These bonuses stack with an elfs

racial bonuses.)

Star Blessing (Su): At 3rd level, you gain a +1 sacred bonus

on attack rolls and saving throws while under the night sky

(above ground and outside during nighttime).

Arvandors Grace (Ex): When you reach 3rd level, the

love of the elven folk actually changes you, instilling in you

a glimmer of elven agelessness. Your racial life span and the

lower limit of each of your age categories increase by 50%.

If this change places you in a younger age category than you

formerly occupied, you retain any ability score bonuses and

penalties you previously gained for agingyour aging effec-

tively stalls until you cross a threshold into an age category

thats new to you.

For example, a human normally reaches middle age at 35,

old age at 53, and venerable age at 70, and his maximum age

is 2d20 years beyond that. A 3rd-level human ruathar reaches

middle age at 52, old age at 79, venerable age at 105, and has

a maximum age of 3d20 years beyond that. If a 40-year-old

human became a 3rd-level ruathar, his age category would

revert to adult. He would retain the 1 penalty to Strength,

Dexterity,  and  Constitution  he  took  when  he  previously

entered middle age at age 35, as well as the +1 bonus to Intel-

ligence, Wisdom, and Charisma he previously received. He

wouldnt age further until age 79, when he would receive the

bonuses and penalties for old age.

Even  elf  ruathars  can  receive  Arvandors  grace;  such

characters are astonishingly long-lived.

PLAYING A RUATHAR

You have earned a special trust that very few nonelves ever

receive. Above all else, you want to live up to that trust and

make sure that you never abuse it. Its very likely that you

already carry yourself with at least some amount of grace,

compassion, and wisdom. After all, if the elves did not see

in  you  many  of  the  values  and  character  traits  they  hold

praiseworthy, they would not have named you a ruathar.

In dealing with others, be patient and consider long-

term repercussions. As a ruathar, your actions reect on

those elves who honored you as an elf-friend. Do not give

hasty answers or act rashly. You believe, as do the elves,

that many problems are only worsened by taking a quick

and ill-considered response today, when a better answer

might become apparent with a little time. Dont be afraid

to stop and ask yourself: What would my elf friends want

me to do now?

While you admire elven ways and seek to emulate elves in

many respects, one of the things that your elf comrades most

admire in you is the fact that you are not an elf. You often

think of things that would never occur to elves, and some-

times see answers to problems that elves might otherwise

miss. You are at your best when you combine your knowledge

and respect for elven ways with the particular viewpoint of

your own race.

spellcaster before, you remain one. If you were a skilled

melee combatant before, you still are now. Do not expect

a  level  or  two  in  ruathar  to  change  the  way  you  handle

yourself in a ght. Remember, thoughelves dont often

seek out unnecessary ghts, and it never hurts to ask your-

self whether an act of stealth, subterfuge, or spellcasting

might achieve the same result as a battle, but with much

less risk.

Advancement

As a ruathar, you are not expected to abandon your previous

calling  and  try  to  be  something  you  are  not.  You  should

continue to hone whatever skills or talents you previously

possessed. If you were a ghter before you became a ruathar,

you should continue to choose feats that support your own

combat style or help to shore up your weaknesses. If you were

a wizard, you should continue to pursue knowledge of spells

in your favored schools of magic and search out arcane lore

useful in your chosen quests.

While the ruathar class abilities offer few specic advance-

ment paths, the class slightly favors multiclass characters,

who nd the combination of a good base attack bonus and

good spellcasting advancement useful. If all you have (other

than your ruathar levels) are levels in ghter or some other

nonspellcasting class, you are not gaining the full benet

the  ruathar  class  offers.  Consider  picking  up  a  level  of  a

spellcasting  class,  even  if  you  otherwise  might  not  have

done so.

The ruathar class also offers some attractive benets for

characters who are good at stealth and detection. While the

class does not provide a great number of skill points, its class

skills are useful ones such as Hide, Search, and Spot. In addi-

tion, the low-light vision and elfwise abilities are very useful

for characters such as halings or humans who otherwise

dont see well in the dark.

Resources

A ruathar can live among the elves as long as he likes, but

he will be expected to be as self-sufcient and responsible

as any other member of the community. A ruathar can

even bring nonelf guests into an elf community, and the

elves will respect the ruathars judgment as to the inten-

tions and discretion of his comrades (although the ruathar

must answer for his poor judgment as any other elf would,

should  his  trust  prove  to  be  misplaced).  A  ruathar  can

certainly purchase or trade for minor magic items, elven

items, spellcasting services, and other such useful objects

if he so chooses.

Ruathars in distress can count on whatever aid the elves

can muster, without expectation of repayment. Of course,

ruathars who require rescuing more than once or twice, or

who ask for help when it isnt clearly needed, could conceiv-

ably  wear  out  their  welcomebut  the  elves  dont  make

elf-friends of the sorts of people who would abuse their trust,

and so the question How much is too much? simply doesnt

come up.

RUATHARS IN THE WORLD

Elf-friends are generally found in and around elf settlements,

as one might expect. Any nonelf who spends a lot of time near

elves might be a ruathar, although in truth real elf-friends

are very rare indeed.

Ruathars who dont actually live among elves often serve

as elven eyes and voices in other lands. For example, a human

cleric who happens to be an elf-friend keeps her eyes open

for news that might interest elves, and certainly reports any

dangers she discovers in her travels. If need be, a ruathar

speaks on behalf of his elf friends, representing their views

in the courts of human nobles or the throne halls of dwarven

clan-fathers. Most ruathars would not presume to commit

their friends to dangerous or distasteful courses of action,

but if some matter must be decided, the ruathar can give an

answer, and the elves will give his words the same weight

they would give to their own.

Organization

No  real  organization  of  ruathars  exists.  Each  ruathar  is

a unique individual, and the majority of ruathars know no

other elf-friends. (The elves themselves know many ruathars,

of course.) Sometimes, small orders or bands of trustworthy

elf alliesfor example, the rangers of a particular forest,

a druid circle, or an elite order of eldritch knights from a

nearby human realmmay include a number of ruathars,

all of whom have rendered great service to elvenkind. Any

character belonging to such a group is likely to be treated

as  an  elf-friend  himself,  even  if  he  has  not  formally  been

named as such.

NPC Reactions

Ruathars have chosen to stand with the elves, for better or

worse. Those who befriend elves befriend ruathars; those who

are enemies to elves are also enemies to ruathars.

Naturally, any elf who meets a ruathar is inclined to be

either friendly or helpful toward the character, unless the

elf is devoted to evilin which case he likely looks on the

ruathar as an insolent dog who crudely mimics the ways of

the elf people.

Rangers  and  good-aligned  bards  or  druids  also  look

favorably upon a ruathar. They know that anyone who has

earned so much trust from the elf people must be a staunch

defender of good and a potential ally in the ght against

evil. Dwarves tend to be suspicious of a ruathar and wonder

what the character sees in the carefree, lazy lifestyle that

elves embrace.

Orcs, goblins, and other humanoids who hate elves also

despise ruathar. A ruathar would be wise to avoid falling into

their hands.

phrase  the  following  material,  including  the  information

from lower DCs. Elf characters making these checks gain a

+10 circumstance bonus.

DC 10: Elves sometimes reward nonelves who have per-

formed some great service for elvenkind by naming them

elf-friends.

DC 15: Elf-friends are called ruathars in Elven. They are

given gifts of magic by the elves they have helped, and they

are received as friends in any elf settlement.

DC 20: Ruathars have phenomenal longevity; theyre

lightly touched by the same timelessness that elves seem to

possess. They also acquire some other elven traits, such as

elven sight, and enjoy the blessing of the elven deities.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about specific elf-friends

in your campaign.

PCs who wish to contact a ruathar can attempt to

do so by making a DC 30 Gather Information

check (or DC 20 if made in an elf settlement).

If a PC is an elf or a ruathar herself, she gains

a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. A

successful  check  puts  the  PC  in  contact

with an elf who knows the ruathar person-

ally; whether the elf consents to lead the PCs

to the elf-friend is another matter.

RUATHARS IN THE GAME

Almost any good-aligned nonelf character

might  be  a  ruathar,  especially  if  he  is  a

natural ally to the elves in your campaign. A

stalwart ranger who helps the elven folk to defend

their forest from evil incursions, a cleric who once

healed a badly wounded elf prince, or a wander-

ing adventurer who happened to recover and

return  an  elven  artifact  might  easily  have

been named an elf-friend. However, most

ruathars in your game will likely be play-

ers, not NPCs. The opportunity to become

a ruathar is a special reward you can offer a player

character who has completed a dangerous quest

that aids the elf people. Even if the PCs did not

necessarily set out to perform a service for the elves, the elves

admire brave and just deeds, especially those that counter

the machinations of evil forces.

The  ruathar  prestige  class  appeals  to  players  who  like

to  immerse  their  characters  in  the  evolving  story  of  the

campaign and sink roots into the world youre building for

them. Winning a rare and special honor such as the undy-

ing friendship of the elf people is an especially memorable

reward, something that these players will appreciate much

more than simple experience points and gold pieces.

Adaptation

The drow have ruathar of  their  own, whose mind-set and

personality are as well attuned to the dark elves as normal

elf-friends are to the surface elves; nonevil player characters

would certainly not want to meet them. Drow-favored ruathar

gain darkvision rather than low-light vision at 2nd level and

a +1 profane bonus on attacks and saves when underground

at 3rd level.

Beyond this, the ruathar prestige class is one that does

not adapt well. You probably shouldnt try to make it into

something it isnt. While you could easily envision a prestige

class of dwarf-friends or haling-friends, the ruathar class

features reect elven strengths and talents. You would have

to create a new set of class features to theme the ruathar

class for another race.

Encounters

Ruathars are almost always guides, allies, or

patrons to good-aligned PCs, and rarely serve

as adversaries.

EL  10:  Johdur  Ter  Harak  is  an  honor-

able  spellsword  who  serves  as  an  advisor

to  and  agent  of  Lord  Gerron,  ruler  of  the

human  city  of  Ildrifaran.  This  city  lies  close

to the Veldir Forest, home to an elven realm. Many

of  Ildrifarans  powerful  merchants  want  to  start

logging  operations  in  the  Veldir  and  settle  its

borders, but Johdur speaks on behalf of the elves,

advising  Lord  Gerron  against  such  actions.  An

unscrupulous merchant might hire the PCs to remove

Johdur from the picture, after the merchant concocts a

story about a glib sorcerer whose wiles have ensnared

Gerrons mind.

each  round  it  remains  attached.  An  attached  weasel  loses

its  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class.  An  attached  weasel

can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove

an attached weasel through grappling, the opponent must

achieve a pin against the creature.

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): Quickpaw can deliver touch spells

for Johdur (see Familiars, page 52 of the Players Handbook).

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Quickpaw is exposed to any effect

that normally allows it to attempt a Re ex saving throw for

half  damage,  it  takes  no  damage  with  a  successful  saving

throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Speak with Master (Ex): Quickpaw can communicate ver-

bally with Johdur. Other creatures do not understand the

communication without magical help.

Skills: Weasels  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Move  Silently

checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks.

They use their Dexterity modi er for Climb checks. A weasel

can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed

or threatened.

SKYPLEDGED

Hear my cry, lords of wind and sky! Honor the age-old bargain

once more!

Mikraeni Vithikil, skypledged druid

The  skypledged  represent  a  mystical  tradition  among  the

raptorans that hearkens back to an ancient pact with power-

ful lords of the Elemental Plane of Air. The sky pledged are a

tangible manifestation of that pact, exchanging divine power

with one another and with powerful air elementals.

BECOMING A SKYPLEDGED

Raptoran clerics and druids will  nd it relatively straight-

forward to join the skypledged once they have acquired a

modicum of divine power.

Entry Requirements

Race: Raptoran.

Spells: Ability to cast summon monster IV or summon

natures ally IV.

Special: Flight extraordinary ability.

CLASS FEATURES

The skypledged class features all relate to the bargain that the

raptoran race made ages ago with powerful air elementals.

Skypledge: The skypledged receive much of their power

from a conduit to the Elemental Plane of Air. In exchange

for  this  gift,  every  skypledged  must  be  an  exemplar  of

loyalty to his or her elemental patrons. Upon joining the

skypledged, you vow to aid air elementals in their struggles

against other primal forces of the universe (such as the

other elements). As part of this vow, you voluntarily forego

casting any spell with the fire, water, or earth descriptors.

If you choose to cast a prohibited spell, it functions nor-

mally, but you are considered a pledgebreaker (described

below) until you pay for your transgression (often with an

atonement spell).

Spell completion and spell trigger items that reproduce

 re, water, or earth effects are not prohibited. You can use a

scroll of wall of  re or a staff of earth and stone normally.

Divine Spellpool (Su): The skypledged and their elemen-

tal patrons share a magical reservoir of spell energy bound

into the fabric of the sky itself. You can tap into this reservoir,

called the spellpool, and call spells from this common

resource at need.

Calling  a  Spell:  Calling  a  spell  from  the

Jantril Sestriin, a

skypledged initiate

spellpool can be done at any distance

but  requires  you  to  have  an

open,  unused  spell  slot  of

the appropriate level.

When  prepar-

ing  spells  for

the  day,  you

decide  at  that  time

whether to leave some spell slots open.

You can call only for a spell of a

level that you could normally

cast. You can call a number

of  spells  per  day  whose  to-

tal  levels  are  equal  to  or

less  than  half  your  caster

level  (round  down,  mini-

mum one). For example,

a 7th-level cleric/1st-lev-

el skypledged can call

one  3rd-level  spell

and  one  1st-level

spell, or two 2nd-level spells, assuming she

has  slots  available  and  isnt  considered  a

pledgebreaker.

When you call a spell, you take a full-round action to

concentrate (which does provoke attacks of opportunity).

The spell appears in your mind at the beginning of your

next turn and can be used immediately. However, if you

do not cast the called spell within a number of minutes

equal  to  your  caster  level,  it  fades  from  your  mind  as

though cast.

Spell Availability: Three stages of access to the spellpool

exist. A new skypledged gains divine spellpool I privi-

leges,  which  grants  access  to  spells  of  1st  to  3rd  level.

Starting  at  4th  level,  divine  spellpool  II  allows  access

to  4th-  to  6th-level  spells.  Starting  at  7th  level,  divine

spellpool III grants access to 7th- to 9th-level spells. No

0-level  spells  are available, but the spell-

pool  can  provide  any  other  spell  on  the

cleric or druid spell list in the

Players  Handbookeven

cleric spells to a dru-

id or druid spells

to  a  cleric.  The

only unavail-

able  spells

those

are

with the  re,

earth,  or  wa-

ter descriptor,

and  those  cleric

spells that appear as domain spells but

not on the main cleric spell list.

Spellpool  Debt:  Every  time  you  call

a spell, you incur a debt. To pay this debt,

you must return spell power to the spellpool, in the form of

a spell you have prepared of a level equal to that of the called

spell, or a number of spells whose combined levels equal the

level of the called spell. For instance, the spellpool debt for

a 5th-level spell is  ve levels, which could be paid off with

another 5th-level spell or any combination of spells whose

levels total  ve. Returning a spells power to the spellpool is a

full-round action, like calling a spell, and depletes a prepared

spell slot as if the spell had been cast.

The debt must be repaid within a number of days equal

to  your  skypledged  class  level;  otherwise,  you  become

a  pledgebreaker  (see  below)  and  you  cannot  access  the

spellpool again until you repay your debt and atone for

your transgression. You must repay this debt as a part of

any atonement for being a pledgebreaker. You cant build

up a positive balance with the spellpool by paying off a debt

before incurring it.

Spellcasting:  At  each  level,  you  gain  new  spells  per

day  and  an  increase  in  caster  level  (and  spells  known,  if

applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  a  divine

spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the

prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other class

feature a character of that class would have gained. If you had

into the fabric of the sky itself. You can tap into this reservoir,

called the spellpool, and call spells from this common

resource at need.

Calling  a  Spell:  Calling  a  spell  from  the

Jantril Sestriin, a

skypledged initiate

spellpool can be done at any distance

but  requires  you  to  have  an

open,  unused  spell  slot  of

the appropriate level.

When  prepar-

ing  spells  for

the  day,  you

decide  at  that  time

whether to leave some spell slots open.

You can call only for a spell of a

level that you could normally

cast. You can call a number

of  spells  per  day  whose  to-

tal  levels  are  equal  to  or

less  than  half  your  caster

level  (round  down,  mini-

mum one). For example,

a 7th-level cleric/1st-lev-

el skypledged can call

one  3rd-level  spell

and  one  1st-level

spell, or two 2nd-level spells, assuming she

has  slots  available  and  isnt  considered  a

pledgebreaker.

When you call a spell, you take a full-round action to

concentrate (which does provoke attacks of opportunity).

The spell appears in your mind at the beginning of your

next turn and can be used immediately. However, if you

do not cast the called spell within a number of minutes

equal  to  your  caster  level,  it  fades  from  your  mind  as

though cast.

Spell Availability: Three stages of access to the spellpool

exist. A new skypledged gains divine spellpool I privi-

leges,  which  grants  access  to  spells  of  1st  to  3rd  level.

Starting  at  4th  level,  divine  spellpool  II  allows  access

to  4th-  to  6th-level  spells.  Starting  at  7th  level,  divine

spellpool III grants access to 7th- to 9th-level spells. No

0-level  spells  are available, but the spell-

pool  can  provide  any  other  spell  on  the

cleric or druid spell list in the

Players  Handbookeven

cleric spells to a dru-

id or druid spells

to  a  cleric.  The

only unavail-

able  spells

those

are

with the  re,

earth,  or  wa-

ter descriptor,

and  those  cleric

spells that appear as domain spells but

not on the main cleric spell list.

Spellpool  Debt:  Every  time  you  call

a spell, you incur a debt. To pay this debt,

you must return spell power to the spellpool, in the form of

a spell you have prepared of a level equal to that of the called

spell, or a number of spells whose combined levels equal the

level of the called spell. For instance, the spellpool debt for

a 5th-level spell is  ve levels, which could be paid off with

another 5th-level spell or any combination of spells whose

levels total  ve. Returning a spells power to the spellpool is a

full-round action, like calling a spell, and depletes a prepared

spell slot as if the spell had been cast.

The debt must be repaid within a number of days equal

to  your  skypledged  class  level;  otherwise,  you  become

a  pledgebreaker  (see  below)  and  you  cannot  access  the

spellpool again until you repay your debt and atone for

your transgression. You must repay this debt as a part of

any atonement for being a pledgebreaker. You cant build

up a positive balance with the spellpool by paying off a debt

before incurring it.

Spellcasting:  At  each  level,  you  gain  new  spells  per

day  and  an  increase  in  caster  level  (and  spells  known,  if

applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  a  divine

spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the

prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other class

feature a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a

skypledged, you must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

Beckon Breeze (Sp): At 2nd level, you gain the ability to

ask your elemental patrons to change the wind speed and

direction on your behalf once per day. You can change the

wind direction as you like, and you can change the wind force

by one category in either directionfor example, from light

to moderate or from severe to strong (see Table 324: Wind

Effects, page 95 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). The prevailing

winds change everywhere within a 100-foot radius centered

on your location at the time you ask the wind lords for aid.

The changes you create with this ability last 1 minute

per level, and it takes 1d4 rounds for the winds to shift as

youve beckoned. This ability does not function indoors

or underground.

Instant Supplication (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, you

can  beg  the  wind-lords  to  save  a  falling  creature  within

sightoften a comrade, but you can seek the boon for the

yourself if youre somehow rendered unable to y. This effect

functions like a feather fall spell cast on the targeted creature.

This is an immediate action that a skypledged character can

use at any time (even on someone elses turn).

Beckon Winds (Sp): When you reach 5th level, this ability

replaces the beckon breeze class feature. It is identical to that

ability, except you can now change the wind force by up to

two categories (from light to strong, for example, or from

severe to moderate).

Servant Supplication (Su): Starting at 6th level, you gain

an ally drawn from the primal power of the Elemental Plane

of Air. Once per day, as a full-round action, you may call a 15

HD Large air elemental (described on page 131) to serve you

loyally and well as long as you avoid pledgebreaker status.

The air elemental remains with you for 1 hour, after which

it returns to the Elemental Plane of Air. The elemental acts

as you command during your turn.

Beckon Gale (Sp): At 8th level, this ability replaces the

beckon winds class feature. It is identical to that ability, except

you can now change the wind force by up to four categories

(from light to windstorm, for example, or from hurricane

to moderate).

Assumptive Supplication (Su): Beginning at 9th level,

you can ask the elemental powers to lend you their form for

1 minute once per day. You assume the form of a Huge air

elemental; see the 20th-level druid wild shape class feature,

page 37 of the Players Handbook).

Cyclonic  Doom  (Su):  When  you  attain  10th  level,  the

elemental lords cloak you in the protective power of your

own personal cyclone, if you take a standard action to ask

for their help. A cyclone of magical wind spins through all

spaces adjacent to you.

If you are on the ground, anyone in an adjacent square

takes 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the magi-

cally enhanced wind. Those who survive must succeed on

a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your Str modier) or be knocked

prone.

If you are ying, anyone in an adjacent square takes 15d6

points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Reex

save (DC 20 + your Str modier) or be ejected 2d610 feet

directly away from you (as if they had been bull rushed

that far).

Check to see whether a creature is adjacent to you at the

start  of  that  creatures  turn  and  at  any  point  during  that

creatures movement. If you move adjacent to someone, for

example, he wont take damage or attempt a save until the

start of his turn. If someone moves adjacent to you, he takes

damage and attempts the saving throw immediately.

The cyclonic doom ability is usable for 10 rounds per

day, split up as desired. You can activate or deactivate your

cyclonic doom as a free action, but you cant do both in the

same turn.

PLAYING A SKYPLEDGED

To be one of the skypledged is to love the freedom of the open

skies and the rush of the wind over your feathered wings. Its

also a solemn role, because you are the tangible proof of an

ancient pact made between your ancestors and the lords of

the Elemental Plane of Air.

All  raptorans  have  a  minor  connection  to  the  pact

everyone nds air spells a little easier to manipulate, and

all raptorans undergo the Walk of the Four Winds to honor

the pact with the air elementals and earn the right to y.

In contrast, you pledge to uphold the pact in a much more

fundamental way. The mysterious lords of the Elemental

Plane of Air grant you extra power because you embody that

ancient pact to the fullest.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

PLEDGEBREAKERS

Your pledge to forego fire, earth, and water spells is entirely

voluntary on your part; you still have access to those spells, and

you can prepare and cast them if you so choose. Likewise, you

can take spells from the divine spellpool without replenishing

the reservoir.

However, if you do either of those things, you are considered a

pledgebreaker. While a pledgebreaker, you retain your spellcast-

ing ability, but you lose access to other class features until you

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

atone for your breach of the ancient pact between the raptorans

and the air elementals. An atonement spell is often a good way

to restore your good standing in terms of the pledge. Unless you

broke your pledge while under magical compulsion or similar

extenuating circumstances, itll cost you 500 XP to atone for

your misdeed. In particularly egregious cases, the elemental

lords may put a geas/quest on you prior to letting you back into

the fold.

Usually, you dont have to do anything other than forgo

spells associated with other elements to keep your part of

the  bargain.  Nevertheless,  the  powerful  elementals  who

made the pact know that if they need winged warriors from

the Material Plane, they can call on the skypledged and get

immediate help. They havent done so in living memory, but

you could get the call to help ght a war on the Inner Planes

at any time.

The skypledged are spread out among the thousands of

ocks  that  make  up  raptoran  society.  Their  only  organi-

zational  purpose  is  to  pass  along  the  tradition  to  worthy

raptorans and look after the interests of the raptoran race. Two

skypledged who meet dont necessarily agree in matters of

alignment, ock afliation, or anything else. As a skypledged,

you share with your fellows an afnity for air and sky, but

little else. Another skypledged is no more or less likely to aid

you than any other raptoran.

Combat

Skypledged are spellcasters first and foremost, so youll

generally circle a battleeld from above, hurling spell after

spell from the sky. Because the spellpool gives you access to

both cleric and druid spells, you can confound your enemies

with combinations few other spellcasters can manage, such

as casting both barkskin and shield of faith before a ght, or

following a holy smite spell with call lightning.

Many skypledged favor summoning spells (though your

dedication to air constrains your choices somewhat), using

minions from the Elemental Plane of Air to ank enemies,

harry ying foes, and chase down escaping enemies.

You  can  also  use  the  wind  itself  to  good  advantage.  By

making the wind blow harder, you can render ranged attacks

difcult or impossible. By confounding archers, youve just

made the sky a safer place for you to y.

Advancement

When  a  skypledged  reaches  old  age,  he  or  she  passes

along the tenets of the skypledge to two or three younger

raptoransoften a ocks most capable clerics or druids.

Not all skypledged survive to old age, so those who do take

multiple apprentices to ensure that the overall number of

skypledged stays more or less constant.

Such training isnt unduly complicated. A would-be member

of the prestige class must memorize the skypledge itself,

then must master the esoteric techniques for accessing the

spellpool. Prospective members also learn the names and

histories of some of the mysterious elemental lords on the

other side of the elementalraptoran pact.

Resources

The skypledged have no larger agenda beyond observing the

ancient pact, so their organization provides little in the way

of resources to its members, though a retiring skypledged

will sometimes pass along heirloom weapons or other magic

items to promising apprentices. Part of the ancient pact states

that the skypledged should be ready to go to war on behalf

of the Elemental Plane of Air at a moments notice, so you

should make sure youre always properly equipped for battle.

(For most adventurers, this wont be a problem.)

SKYPLEDGED IN THE WORLD

As an NPC, a skypledged makes an effective elite guardian

of a raptoran ock. The ability to combine druid and cleric

magic offers an interesting surprise in combat, and a ying

spellcaster with air elemental allies poses a tactical challenge

for even a well-prepared group of adventurers.

Organization

Theres no hierarchy among the skypledged. The organization

of  the  class  manifests  more  as  a  shared  mystical  tradition

and a way of life than as a group with schemes and agendas.

Individual  skypledged  certainly  have  goals  of  their  own,

and theres nothing preventing a group of skypledged from

working toward a common objective.

If  anyone  directs  the  affairs  of  the  skypledged,  its  the

elemental lords on the Elemental Plane of Air. The elemental

lords vie with each other for dominance on their own plane.

They drop their internal rivalries only when plotting against

the forces of other elemental planes and when facing other

threats to the power of air.

The  elemental  lords  function  best  in  a  campaign  when

their  exact  nature  and  goals  remain  mysterious.  If  you

want to introduce a specic elemental lord into one of your

adventures, start with an elder air elemental, increase one of

its mental ability scores to the mid-20s, and add levels in a

spellcasting class (probably cleric or sorcerer). Names of the

better-known elemental lords include Halasti of the Twelve

Zephyrs, Shallafari Achandi, Cumularon, and Rashalae of

the Last Breath.

Most skypledged have positions of authority within a

raptoran ock, but a few wander the Material Plane helping

raptoran communities in need. Some high-level skypledged

spend time on the Elemental Plane of Air, soaring across the

endless sky there.

Recently  a  couple  of  factions  have  emerged  within  the

skypledged. The Vanguard of the Home Skies is a group of

several dozen skypledged who have taken it upon themselves

to ght the forces of earth, re, and waterdespite no request

to do so from an elemental lord. They attack nonraptoran

spellcasters who rely on the power of one of these elements,

attack elementals of these kinds they nd on the Material

Plane, and even raid the other elemental planes. The Libera-

tors of Vanakalth are a group of seven skypledged who all

had a role in the freeing of a noble djinni from imprisonment

by a rakshasa clan. The Liberators are making war on the

rakshasas and may have other goals; the djinni Vanakalth

now directs their affairs from a cloud-castle on the Elemental

Plane of Air.

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a

skypledged, you must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

Beckon Breeze (Sp): At 2nd level, you gain the ability to

ask your elemental patrons to change the wind speed and

direction on your behalf once per day. You can change the

wind direction as you like, and you can change the wind force

by one category in either directionfor example, from light

to moderate or from severe to strong (see Table 324: Wind

Effects, page 95 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). The prevailing

winds change everywhere within a 100-foot radius centered

on your location at the time you ask the wind lords for aid.

The changes you create with this ability last 1 minute

per level, and it takes 1d4 rounds for the winds to shift as

youve beckoned. This ability does not function indoors

or underground.

Instant Supplication (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, you

can  beg  the  wind-lords  to  save  a  falling  creature  within

sightoften a comrade, but you can seek the boon for the

yourself if youre somehow rendered unable to y. This effect

functions like a feather fall spell cast on the targeted creature.

This is an immediate action that a skypledged character can

use at any time (even on someone elses turn).

Beckon Winds (Sp): When you reach 5th level, this ability

replaces the beckon breeze class feature. It is identical to that

ability, except you can now change the wind force by up to

two categories (from light to strong, for example, or from

severe to moderate).

Servant Supplication (Su): Starting at 6th level, you gain

an ally drawn from the primal power of the Elemental Plane

of Air. Once per day, as a full-round action, you may call a 15

HD Large air elemental (described on page 131) to serve you

loyally and well as long as you avoid pledgebreaker status.

The air elemental remains with you for 1 hour, after which

it returns to the Elemental Plane of Air. The elemental acts

as you command during your turn.

Beckon Gale (Sp): At 8th level, this ability replaces the

beckon winds class feature. It is identical to that ability, except

you can now change the wind force by up to four categories

(from light to windstorm, for example, or from hurricane

to moderate).

Assumptive Supplication (Su): Beginning at 9th level,

you can ask the elemental powers to lend you their form for

1 minute once per day. You assume the form of a Huge air

elemental; see the 20th-level druid wild shape class feature,

page 37 of the Players Handbook).

Cyclonic  Doom  (Su):  When  you  attain  10th  level,  the

elemental lords cloak you in the protective power of your

own personal cyclone, if you take a standard action to ask

for their help. A cyclone of magical wind spins through all

spaces adjacent to you.

If you are on the ground, anyone in an adjacent square

takes 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the magi-

cally enhanced wind. Those who survive must succeed on

a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your Str modier) or be knocked

prone.

If you are ying, anyone in an adjacent square takes 15d6

points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Reex

save (DC 20 + your Str modier) or be ejected 2d610 feet

directly away from you (as if they had been bull rushed

that far).

Check to see whether a creature is adjacent to you at the

start  of  that  creatures  turn  and  at  any  point  during  that

creatures movement. If you move adjacent to someone, for

example, he wont take damage or attempt a save until the

start of his turn. If someone moves adjacent to you, he takes

damage and attempts the saving throw immediately.

The cyclonic doom ability is usable for 10 rounds per

day, split up as desired. You can activate or deactivate your

cyclonic doom as a free action, but you cant do both in the

same turn.

PLAYING A SKYPLEDGED

To be one of the skypledged is to love the freedom of the open

skies and the rush of the wind over your feathered wings. Its

also a solemn role, because you are the tangible proof of an

ancient pact made between your ancestors and the lords of

the Elemental Plane of Air.

All  raptorans  have  a  minor  connection  to  the  pact

everyone nds air spells a little easier to manipulate, and

all raptorans undergo the Walk of the Four Winds to honor

the pact with the air elementals and earn the right to y.

In contrast, you pledge to uphold the pact in a much more

fundamental way. The mysterious lords of the Elemental

Plane of Air grant you extra power because you embody that

ancient pact to the fullest.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

PLEDGEBREAKERS

Your pledge to forego fire, earth, and water spells is entirely

voluntary on your part; you still have access to those spells, and

you can prepare and cast them if you so choose. Likewise, you

can take spells from the divine spellpool without replenishing

the reservoir.

However, if you do either of those things, you are considered a

pledgebreaker. While a pledgebreaker, you retain your spellcast-

ing ability, but you lose access to other class features until you

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

atone for your breach of the ancient pact between the raptorans

and the air elementals. An atonement spell is often a good way

to restore your good standing in terms of the pledge. Unless you

broke your pledge while under magical compulsion or similar

extenuating circumstances, itll cost you 500 XP to atone for

your misdeed. In particularly egregious cases, the elemental

lords may put a geas/quest on you prior to letting you back into

the fold.

Usually, you dont have to do anything other than forgo

spells associated with other elements to keep your part of

the  bargain.  Nevertheless,  the  powerful  elementals  who

made the pact know that if they need winged warriors from

the Material Plane, they can call on the skypledged and get

immediate help. They havent done so in living memory, but

you could get the call to help ght a war on the Inner Planes

at any time.

The skypledged are spread out among the thousands of

ocks  that  make  up  raptoran  society.  Their  only  organi-

zational  purpose  is  to  pass  along  the  tradition  to  worthy

raptorans and look after the interests of the raptoran race. Two

skypledged who meet dont necessarily agree in matters of

alignment, ock afliation, or anything else. As a skypledged,

you share with your fellows an afnity for air and sky, but

little else. Another skypledged is no more or less likely to aid

you than any other raptoran.

Combat

Skypledged are spellcasters first and foremost, so youll

generally circle a battleeld from above, hurling spell after

both cleric and druid spells, you can confound your enemies

with combinations few other spellcasters can manage, such

raptorans  to  observe  the  tenets  of  the  pact  has  cooled

somewhat over the centuries. The average raptoran doesnt

often think about the races pact with the air elementals.

Most raptorans dont consider the pact an active concern

but a historical event, and those same individuals largely

see the skypledged as followers of an esoteric mysticism.

Raptorans  dont  treat  a  skypledged  any  better  than  they

would treat a member of another class. They have a starting

attitude of indifferent.

The skypledged have at least something in common with

one another, even if their alignments and ock afliations

are at odds. Two skypledged who meet have a starting attitude

toward  one  another  one  step  more  favorable  than  would

otherwise be the case.

Creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air have a

starting attitude of friendly toward skypledged. Its rare

for  Material  Plane  creatures  to  understand  elemental

affairs, and rarer still for others to pledge service to an

elemental ideal.

Creatures native to other elemental planes have a starting

attitude of unfriendly if they know theyre interacting with

a skypledged.

If a raptoran is known to be a pledgebreaker, the attitudes

of Inner Plane natives are reversed. The powers of earth,

fire, and water will be eager to talk to someone who has

spurned the air, but natives of the Elemental Plane of Air

will suspect treachery, or at least untrustworthiness, from

a pledgebreaker.

much  from  its  members.  Unless  youre  planning  a  planar

campaign where the Elemental Plane of Air is threatened,

the elemental lords that created the raptoran pact will never

demand anything from the skypledged.

A skypledged PC will want to use her beckon abilities

from time to time, so the adventures you create should have

some outdoor encounters. In addition, like any DM with a

raptoran PC at the table, youll quickly become adept at the

aerial  maneuverability  rules  (described  on  page  20  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Adaptation

As written, the prestige class reects an important event in

raptoran history: the pact with the air elementals. It can also

serve as a model for any spellcasting prestige class that has

pledged itself to an extraplanar power. If you alter the class

in this way, you can leave the spellpool class feature intact

and develop new abilities to replace the beckon and cyclonic

doom class features.

Encounters

Encounters with the skypledged often feature a mix of druid

and cleric magic. They frequently incorporate air elementals,

whether summoned or there as allies.

EL 8: Jantril Sestriin, the star chief of the Rinti ock

(see  page  82),  is  a  recent  adherent  to  the  skypledged  way

who delights in ying high over enemies, then summoning

creatures to do the actual ghting for her.

SKYPLEDGED LORE

Characters  with  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can  research  the

skypledged  to  learn  more  about  them.  When  a  character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following material,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The skypledged? Theyre raptoran air-element

spellcasters.

DC  15:  The  skypledged  are  so  called  because  theyve

promised to aid the Elemental Plane of Air if its attacked.

In the meantime, they can draw spell power from the plane,

and theyre really good at summoning air elementals.

DC 20: Most skypledged can cast both cleric and druid

spells, and many have a powerful air elemental at their beck

and call. They can control the wind itself.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about specific skypledged in the

campaign.

PCs who wish to contact a skypledged must rst locate a

raptoran tribe. Once they have established contact with

the tribe, a successful DC 20 Diplomacy check convinces

the raptorans to identify one among their number (if any)

as a skypledged.

Divine  Spellpool  I  (Su):  Whenever  Jantril  has  open,

unused spell slots of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, she can call up to

three total levels of spells (from the cleric or druid list) to go

into those slots. It takes a full-round action to do so, and the

spell or spells remain available for 1 minute.

Spells  with  the  fire,  earth,  or  water  descriptor  are

can y for 2 rounds at no penalty, or for 4 rounds at the cost of

becoming fatigued. A ying raptoran can make a dive attack

(as a charge, but must y at least 30 feet, descend at least 10

feet, and use a piercing weapon to deal double damage on

a hit).

Resist Natures Lure (Ex): Jantril gains a +4 bonus on

not prohibited.

Trackless  Step  (Ex):  Jantril  leaves  no  trail  in  natural

ADVANCED LARGE AIR ELEMENTAL

This  air  elemental  is  typical  of  those  received  through  a

Flyby Attack, Improved Initiative, Mobility, Spring Attack,

Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (slam).

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a 1 penalty on

attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.

Whirlwind (Su): This elemental can transform itself into a

whirlwind once every 10 minutes for up to 7 rounds at a time.

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, 30 feet wide at the

top, and 40 feet tall. Medium or smaller creatures take 2d6

points of damage per round in the whirlwind (Reex DC

19 negates).

A second Reex save at the same DC is required to avoid

being picked up by the winds. Creatures in the whirlwind

take a 4 penalty to Dexterity and a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

A creature that can y is allowed a Reex save each round to

escape the whirlwind.

If the base of the whirlwind touches the ground, the whirl-

ing debris creates a 20-foot-diameter cloud centered on the

whirlwind. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvi-

sion, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment,

while those farther away have total concealment.

Fear nothing! Death from the sky!

STORMTALON

Austriesha, stormtalon captain

The stormtalons are consummate aerial warriors, using both

their weapons and their razor-sharp foot talons to dive on

their hapless foes. They are elite protectors of the raptoran

race, sent by the high chieftain whenever a raptoran ock

is in trouble.

BECOMING A STORMTALON

Becoming a stormtalon means joining the raptoran equiva-

lent of the military. Recruits are tested for combat prowess

before admission into the ranks of the stormtalons, so ght-

ers, paladins, rangers, and barbarians get into the prestige

class easiest. The latter two classes nd the stormtalon class

particularly appealing because they dont wear heavy armor

anyway and will be able to y unencumbered.

Entry Requirements

Race: Raptoran.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Special: Flight extraordinary ability.

Creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air have a

starting attitude of friendly toward skypledged. Its rare

for  Material  Plane  creatures  to  understand  elemental

affairs, and rarer still for others to pledge service to an

elemental ideal.

Creatures native to other elemental planes have a starting

attitude of unfriendly if they know theyre interacting with

a skypledged.

If a raptoran is known to be a pledgebreaker, the attitudes

of Inner Plane natives are reversed. The powers of earth,

fire, and water will be eager to talk to someone who has

spurned the air, but natives of the Elemental Plane of Air

will suspect treachery, or at least untrustworthiness, from

a pledgebreaker.

much  from  its  members.  Unless  youre  planning  a  planar

campaign where the Elemental Plane of Air is threatened,

the elemental lords that created the raptoran pact will never

demand anything from the skypledged.

A skypledged PC will want to use her beckon abilities

from time to time, so the adventures you create should have

some outdoor encounters. In addition, like any DM with a

raptoran PC at the table, youll quickly become adept at the

aerial  maneuverability  rules  (described  on  page  20  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Adaptation

As written, the prestige class reects an important event in

raptoran history: the pact with the air elementals. It can also

serve as a model for any spellcasting prestige class that has

pledged itself to an extraplanar power. If you alter the class

in this way, you can leave the spellpool class feature intact

and develop new abilities to replace the beckon and cyclonic

doom class features.

Encounters

Encounters with the skypledged often feature a mix of druid

and cleric magic. They frequently incorporate air elementals,

whether summoned or there as allies.

EL 8: Jantril Sestriin, the star chief of the Rinti ock

(see  page  82),  is  a  recent  adherent  to  the  skypledged  way

who delights in ying high over enemies, then summoning

creatures to do the actual ghting for her.

SKYPLEDGED LORE

Characters  with  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can  research  the

skypledged  to  learn  more  about  them.  When  a  character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following material,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The skypledged? Theyre raptoran air-element

spellcasters.

DC  15:  The  skypledged  are  so  called  because  theyve

promised to aid the Elemental Plane of Air if its attacked.

In the meantime, they can draw spell power from the plane,

and theyre really good at summoning air elementals.

DC 20: Most skypledged can cast both cleric and druid

spells, and many have a powerful air elemental at their beck

and call. They can control the wind itself.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about specific skypledged in the

campaign.

PCs who wish to contact a skypledged must rst locate a

raptoran tribe. Once they have established contact with

the tribe, a successful DC 20 Diplomacy check convinces

the raptorans to identify one among their number (if any)

as a skypledged.

SKYPLEDGED IN THE GAME

A skypledged PC doesnt place any unusual demands on the

DM, because the skypledged organization doesnt demand

You on her animal companion.

Divine  Spellpool  I  (Su):  Whenever  Jantril  has  open,

unused spell slots of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, she can call up to

three total levels of spells (from the cleric or druid list) to go

into those slots. It takes a full-round action to do so, and the

spell or spells remain available for 1 minute.

Spells  with  the  fire,  earth,  or  water  descriptor  are

unavailable. Jantril must repay her spellpool debt within

1 day; doing so is a full-round action. Repaying the debt

depletes  a  combination  of  prepared  spells  whose  total

the spellpool.

Raptoran Traits: Raptorans can glide at a speed of 40 feet,

with average maneuverability. Raptorans have an unerring

raptoran spellcaster gains +1 caster level for air spells. Jantril

can y for 2 rounds at no penalty, or for 4 rounds at the cost of

becoming fatigued. A ying raptoran can make a dive attack

(as a charge, but must y at least 30 feet, descend at least 10

feet, and use a piercing weapon to deal double damage on

a hit).

Resist Natures Lure (Ex): Jantril gains a +4 bonus on

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Skypledge: Jantril wont cast any spell with the fire,

water, or earth descriptor. Spell completion and spell trig-

ger items that reproduce fire, water, or earth effects are

not prohibited.

Trackless  Step  (Ex):  Jantril  leaves  no  trail  in  natural

surroundings and cannot be tracked.

Wild Shape (Su): Jantril can change into a Small to Medium

animal and back again, as per the polymorph spell. This ability

lasts for 7 hours or until she changes back

Woodland  Stride  (Ex):  Jantril  can  move  through

natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar ter-

rain  at  her  normal  speed  and  without  damage  or  other

that  are  magically  manipulated  to  impede  motion  still

ADVANCED LARGE AIR ELEMENTAL

This  air  elemental  is  typical  of  those  received  through  a

skypledgeds servant supplication class feature. It is a 15 HD

version of the one found on page 95 of the Monster Manual.

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a 1 penalty on

attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.

Whirlwind (Su): This elemental can transform itself into a

whirlwind once every 10 minutes for up to 7 rounds at a time.

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, 30 feet wide at the

top, and 40 feet tall. Medium or smaller creatures take 2d6

points of damage per round in the whirlwind (Reex DC

19 negates).

A second Reex save at the same DC is required to avoid

being picked up by the winds. Creatures in the whirlwind

take a 4 penalty to Dexterity and a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

A creature that can y is allowed a Reex save each round to

escape the whirlwind.

If the base of the whirlwind touches the ground, the whirl-

ing debris creates a 20-foot-diameter cloud centered on the

whirlwind. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvi-

sion, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment,

while those farther away have total concealment.

Fear nothing! Death from the sky!

STORMTALON

Austriesha, stormtalon captain

The stormtalons are consummate aerial warriors, using both

their weapons and their razor-sharp foot talons to dive on

their hapless foes. They are elite protectors of the raptoran

race, sent by the high chieftain whenever a raptoran ock

is in trouble.

BECOMING A STORMTALON

Becoming a stormtalon means joining the raptoran equiva-

lent of the military. Recruits are tested for combat prowess

before admission into the ranks of the stormtalons, so ght-

ers, paladins, rangers, and barbarians get into the prestige

class easiest. The latter two classes nd the stormtalon class

particularly appealing because they dont wear heavy armor

anyway and will be able to y unencumbered.

Entry Requirements

Race: Raptoran.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Special: Flight extraordinary ability.

CLASS FEATURES

The stormtalons class features all make you a better  ghter

in the air.

Foot Talons (Ex): The  rst lesson a stormtalon learns is

how to sharpen his or her foot talons so they become weap-

ons. Such sharpening takes an hour a day to maintain, but

it turns your feet into claws that deal 1d6 points of damage

plus your Strength modi er. You are considered pro cient

with these attacks. When you make a full attack, you use

your full base attack bonus with any weapons in hand and

take a 5 penalty on your talon attack. The Multiattack feat

(see page 304 of the Monster Manual) lessens this penalty

to 2.

You can use your foot talons only when youre airborne.

They deal both piercing and slashing damage, so theyll

do  double  damage  when  you  make  a  dive  attack  (see

page 68).

The talons are useful as weapons, but theyre not dexterous

enough to wield weapons or perform any action requiring

 ne motor skills.

Bonus Aerial Feat: At every even-numbered level, you

learn a new trick useful to aerial combat. Choose a feat from

the following list: Aerial Re exes, Aerial Superiority, Born

Flyer, Diving Charge, Flyby Attack*, Hover*, Improved

Flight, Multiattack*, Wingover*.

Feat described on page 304 of the Monster Manual.

New feats described in Chapter 6 of this book.

Fast Flight (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a fly

speed 10 feet faster than the norm for your race. At 5th

level, its 20 feet faster, and at 9th level, its 40 feet faster.

Except that this class feature applies to fly speed rather

than land speed, it otherwise functions like the fast move-

ment barbarian class feature described on page 25 of the

Players Handbook.

Improved Foot Talons (Ex): When you reach 7th level,

you have become more adept at dealing wicked cuts with

your foot talons. Your talons now deal 1d8 points of damage

and can be used even when you arent  ying.

PLAYING A STORMTALON

The stormtalons battle cry Death from the sky! tells you

all  you  need  to  know.  You  swoop  down  on  your  foes  and

deal grievous damage before they even know what hit them.

Take this prestige class if you want a potent combination of

battle eld maneuverability and combat effectiveness.

Youre also part of a larger organization devoted to protect-

ing raptoran  ocks scattered all across the world. When the

high chieftain of the raptorans sends in the stormtalons, its

a sign that she takes a particular crisis seriously.

Combat

You obviously  ght best when youre in the air, but your tacti-

cal decisions just start there. You can function as pinpoint

artillery  for  your  allies,  circling  above  the  battle eld  and

skewering with arrows anything that moves. Alternatively,

you can dive down on your foes, dealing double damage with

a spear or other piercing weapon and then either moving back

out of harms way or hovering just above the enemy. Once

your enemies have seen one technique, you can confound

them by switching to the other.

Your ability to get airborne is also useful before a  ght starts.

You can scout out the best terrain in relative safety and perhaps

see enemies before they see you. Youre able to get around

the  battle eld  easier  than  either  your  nonraptoran

comrades or your enemies, so you can quickly move

to provide a  anking situation, get a healing potion

to a fallen friend, or cut off an enemys escape route.

Advancement

Would-be stormtalons have to pass a six-week training regi-

men designed to weed out those who arent tough enough. You

dont have to play through the whole basic training process;

your DM will likely account for it between adventures.

Youll periodically reconnect with the stormtalon leader-

ship to get further training. The leadership may also assign

you  missions  from  time  to  time,  sending  you  to  defend  a

raptoran  ock thats in some kind of trouble.

Resources

Stormtalons traditionally wield spears in combat, and the

organization has accumulated quite an arsenal of magic spears

over the years. PCs who want a magic spear can get one for

80% of its normal cost if they contact the stormtalons and

request one. Acquiring a spear this way takes one week per

point of enhancement bonus (or equivalent if the spear has

a special ability).

STORMTALONS IN THE WORLD

The stormtalon prestige class is a good  t for a player who

wants to focus on aerial combat. As a group, the stormtalons

function as the cavalry that rushes in at the last minute to save

an endangered raptoran  ock. Depending on the situation,

the stormtalons might be the answer to PCs prayers or the

object of their curses.

Organization

The  stormtalons  are  organized

like  a  military,  with  senior

of cers  issuing  commands  to

junior  of cers  in  charge  of

small  groups  of  rank-and-

 le soldiers. However, they are

dispersed  across  the  world,  so

communication up and down the

chain of command is reserved for

major issues. Each stormtalon has

a great degree of autonomy.

At any one time, a few hundred storm-

talons are stationed near the high chieftain of

the raptorans. If a raptoran  ock is in trouble,

the  group  sends  a  message  (often  by  magical

means)  to  the  high  chieftain.  If  the  chieftain

perceives a serious threat, she orders a small team

of  stormtalons  (usually  less  than  a  dozen)  to   y  to

the  distressed   ock  and  take  care  of  the  situation.

Storm talons are also usually the ones chosen as

messengers when the high chief needs to deliver

urgent news to leaders of other races.

Stormtalons  who  arent  stationed

with the high chieftain or out

on a mission are dispersed

among the thousands of

raptoran  flocks.  Often

an individual stormtalon or a small group will be assigned

several flocks to watch over. The individual or group visits

each in turn, benefiting from each flocks hospitality but

remaining alert for threats.

Stormtalons  can  also  request  detached  duty,  which

maintains their standing in the organization but frees them

to travel on their own. As long as a stormtalon provides a

way for superior of cers to make contact with him, hes likely

to be granted detached duty status. Adventuring PCs will

probably spend most of their time on detached duty.

A rivalry exists between the high chieftains stormtalons

and  those  dispersed  among  the  raptoran   ocks.  The  high

chieftains  stormtalons  believe  that  their  fellows  lose  the

bene t of discipline when they arent in daily contact with

the rest of the organization. The  ock-based stormtalons

believe that the high chieftains stormtalons are too by the

book and unwilling to employ creative solutions. Theres

an  element  of  truth  to  both  stereotypes.  The  rivalry  isnt

violenta stormtalon is a stormtalon, after allbut the

raptoran penchant for debate often comes home to roost in

a chieftain-versus- ock argument.

NPC Reactions

The  average  raptoran  adores  the  stormtalons.  Theyre

the  raptoran  equivalent  of  the  colonial  Minutemen,  the

Texas  Rangers,  and  the  101st  Airborne  all  rolled  into

one.  A  raptorans  starting  attitude  toward  a  stormtalon  is

friendlyor helpful if the stormtalons are responding to a

threat against a ock.

STORMTALON LORE

Characters with Knowledge (local) can research the storm-

talons to learn more about them. When a character makes

a  skill  check,  read  or  paraphrase  the  following  material,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The stormtalons are what raptorans call their

best warriors.

DC 15: Stormtalons work in small groups at the behest

of the raptoran leadership. They swoop in to save raptoran

communities under some kind of threat.

DC 20: The stormtalons train endlessly in aerial combat,

and they ght in three dimensions better than most people

ght in two.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about the activities of specic storm-

talons in your campaign.

Stormtalons are far from shy, so PCs trying to establish

contact  with  one  need  only  contact  the  nearest  raptoran

ock (which can require a DC 20 Gather Information check

if  its  location  is  not  already  known).  Once  the  PCs  have

made their intentions known, the nearest stormtalon will

seek them out at a time and place of his choosing to nd out

their purpose.

STORMTALONS IN YOUR GAME

A stormtalon PC will probably spend most of his time on

detached duty status, but you can have a superior officer

assign a mission if you need to kick-start an adventure

that  involves  a  threatened  raptoran  flock.  Stormtalons

will fight alongside nonraptorans as needed, so the entire

party  can  rush  to  the  rescue  of  a  raptoran  flock  under

monstrous attack.

The stormtalons are also a useful way to rescue PCs who

have gotten themselves in over their heads near a raptoran

communityand a tough foe for PCs who attack a raptoran

cliff dwelling.

Any raptoran PC wants the chance to y from time to time,

but its essential to give a stormtalon that chance in almost

every ght. Occasionally, its okay to send the action into

low-ceilinged tunnels when you want to give a stormtalon

PC an extra challenge, but such encounters should be the

exception, not the rule.

Adaptation

While the stormtalons are designed for the raptoran race, this

prestige class would be appropriate for any ying race such as

gargoyles, half-celestials, half-ends, and aarakocras (found

in the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting).

Encounters

Encounters with stormtalons should show off as many cool

aerial maneuvers as possible. Nonying PCs should denitely

feel limited by their inability to reach their foes.

EL 8: Two stormtalon recruits are a typical patrol. Theyre

eager to ght, but they have orders to break off combat and

report back if theyre outmatched.

Stormtalon Recruit: Raptoran barbarian 5/stormtalon

1;  CR  6;  Medium  humanoid  (raptoran);  HD  5d12+10  plus

1d10+2; hp 55; Init +1; Spd 40 ft., y 40 ft. (average); AC 16,

melee (1d6+1, foot talons [airborne only]) or +8/+3 ranged

(1d8+4/3, masterwork footbow); SA foot talons, rage 2/day;

SQ improved uncanny dodge, raptoran traits, uncanny dodge,

trap sense +1; AL CN; SV Fort +8, Ref +2, Will +2; Str 16, Dex

13, Con 14, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 8.

Skills  and  Feats:  Climb  +4,  Intimidate  +7,  Jump  +16,

Listen +9, Spot +9, Survival +9; Flyby Attack, Multiattack,

Power Attack.

Languages: Common, Tuilvilanuue.

Foot Talons (Ex): Stormtalon recruits have claws that deal

1d6+1 points of damage. When they make a full attack, they

use their full base attack bonus with any weapons in hand

and take a 2 penalty on their talon attack.

Stormtalon recruits use foot talons only when theyre

airborne. They deal double damage in a dive attack.

Rage (Ex): Twice per day, this stormtalon recruit can

enter a state of fierce rage that lasts for 7 rounds. The fol-

lowing changes are in effect as long as he rages: hp increase

by 12; AC 14, touch 9, at-footed 13; Grp +11; Atk +12 melee

(1d8+8/3, +1 spear); Full Atk +12/+7 melee (1d8+8/3, +1

spear) and +9 melee (1d6+2, foot talons [airborne only]); SV

Fort +10, Will +4; Str 20, Con 18; Climb +6, Jump +18. At

the end of their rage, stormtalon recruits are fatigued for

the duration of the encounter.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Cannot be anked and

can only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least 9

levels of rogue.

Raptoran Traits: Raptorans can glide at a speed of 40 feet,

with average maneuverability. Raptorans have an unerring

sense of direction and always know which way is north. This

raptoran can y for 2 rounds at no penalty, or for 4 rounds at

the cost of becoming fatigued. A ying raptoran can make a

dive attack (as a charge, but must y at least 30 feet, descend

at  least  10  feet,  and  use  a  piercing  weapon  to  deal  double

damage on a hit).

If raging, this stormatlon recruit can safely stay aloft for

up to 4 rounds (and be fatigued when the rage ends, until

the encounter is over) or up to 8 rounds (and be exhausted

when the rage and ight both end, then fatigued when the

encounter is over).

WHISPERKNIFE

Killed a haling over a triing bit of property? Burned a wagon,

maybe, or drove peaceful settlers out into the wilderness? Cheated

the small folk out of money because you knew that they couldnt

even the scorewhen there were only a handful of them but a

whole townful of you? Ill nd you, and Ill collect the debt you owe

my kin. Youll never see me coming.

Gerend Eastwind, haling whisperknife

Many halings are rogues; everyone knows that. Some towns

are  careful  to  befriend  haling  caravans,  offering  honest

work and a fair deal in the expectation that halings wont

steal  from  friends.  Other  settlements  are  standofsh  and

suspicious, relying on vigilance and harsh laws to discourage

any larcenous intent. Still other places greet halings with

violence, cruelty, and scorn, sheltering brigands and thieves

who feel free to murder and rob those who are smaller and

less numerous than they are. Haling caravans avoid such

settlements from then onbut the haling whisperknife

seeks them out, repaying murder, theft, or humiliation in

the same coin.

BECOMING A WHISPERKNIFE

A  whisperknife  must  be  stealthy,  quick,  and  skilled  at

both ranged and melee combat. The quickest path to this

prestige class is to begin with one or two levels of rogue in

order to gain the necessary skills and sneak attack ability,

and then switch to fighter or ranger to improve overall

combat ability (in the form of base attack bonus) and learn

the necessary feats.

A few whisperknives acquire some arcane spellcasting in

the form of a couple of levels of sorcerer or wizard, because

spells such as invisibility or deep slumber can make the deadly

work of the whisperknife much easier. A whisperknife of this

sort often begins with three or four levels of rogue, then gains

ve or six levels in an arcane spellcasting class. However,

qualifying for the whisperknife class is much easier with the

bonus feats offered by either the ghter or ranger class.

CLASS FEATURES

As you advance in level, you become better at switching from

melee combat to ranged combat in the blink of an eye. You

become a mobile and infuriating opponent who can launch

a devastating barrage of sneak attacks.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: You gain no prociency

with any weapon or armor.

Rapid Shot: Whenever you are throwing light weap-

ons, you are treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even

if you do not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

Most whisperknives, true to their names, throw daggers

in this way.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): You cannot be caught flat-footed

and  react  to  danger  before  your  senses  would  normally

allow  you  to  do  so.  You  retain  your  Dexterity  bonus  to

AC  even  if  caught  flat-footed  or  struck  by  an  invisible

attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to

AC if immobilized.

If you already have uncanny dodge from another class,

you instead gain improved uncanny dodge (see below), and

the levels from that class stack with your levels of whisper-

knife to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to

ank you.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Beginning  at  2nd  level,  you  deal

an extra 1d6 points of damage when you are anking an

opponent or at any time when the target would be denied

its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged

attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. At 5th level the

extra damage increases to 2d6, and at 8th level it increases

to 3d6. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Players

Handbook.

Defensive  Throw  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  you  learn  special

defensive  techniques  for  attacking  with  thrown  weapons.

You no longer provoke attacks of opportunity for attacking

with a thrown weapon (however, if you attack with a differ-

ent sort of ranged weapon, such as a bow, you still provoke

attacks of opportunity).

Improved Catch (Ex): Also at 3rd level, you become so

skilled with thrown weapons that you can take better advan-

tage of a weapon with the returning special ability. When

you make a ranged attack with a returning weapon, you can

move after the attack, and the weapon will still return to you

as long as line of sight between you and the weapon exists at

the beginning of your next turn.

Close Defense (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, you know how

to ght in a crowd of larger opponents. If you are adjacent

to  a  Medium  or  larger  foe,  you  gain  a  +2  dodge  bonus  to

Armor Class against attacks from all foes adjacent to you. If

the Medium or larger foe moves away or falls, you lose the

benet of close defense (although you might be able to move

next to the same foe again on your next turn and reestablish

it).  Enemies  making  ranged  attacks  or  attacks  with  reach

weapons arent affected by close defense.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 6th level, you have mastered

the art of unusually swift movement. Your land speed is

faster than the norm for halings by 10 feet. This benet

applies only when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or

medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this

bonus before modifying your speed because of any load

carried or armor worn.

Poison  Use  (Ex):  Starting  at  6th  level,  you  are  trained

in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning

yourself when applying poison to a blade.

Vengeful Strike (Su): Beginning at 7th level, as a standard

action you can execute a single vengeful strike in place of a

sneak attack. You coldly whisper the name of your intended

victim to your weapon, and then you make a single melee

or ranged attack. You gain a +2 morale bonus on the attack

roll. If you hit, your foe must make a Fortitude save (DC

10 + your class level + your Dex modier) or be stunned for

1d4 rounds.

You must know the victims name in order to make a

vengeful strike; that orc over there is not good enough.

Creatures without names (most creatures of Intelligence 2

or lower) are not subject to a vengeful strike. You usually use

this ability against a person or creature you know to have

harmed halings.

You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and three

times per day at 10th level.

Superior  Catch  (Ex):  When  you  reach  8th  level,  your

improved catch ability is extended. You can use two return-

ing weapons for two attacks each in a single round, or you

can use one returning weapon for three attacks in the same

round, as long as your target is no farther away than one range

increment.  (If  your  target  is  farther  away  than  one  range

increment, you can still use your superior catch ability, but

only for a single attack each turn.)

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): When you reach 9th

level, you can no longer be anked. See the barbarian class

feature, page 26 of the Players Handbook.

Ranged  Flank  (Ex):  At  9th  level,  you  know  how  to

flank a foe by using a ranged weapon. You must be within

10 feet of the enemy in question, and you flank as if you

were wielding a reach weapon (see Reach Weapons, page

137 of the Players Handbook). You do not threaten the foe

and may not make attacks of opportunity against the foe

unless you are actually adjacent to the foe and armed with

a melee weapon.

PLAYING A WHISPERKNIFE

If theres one thing you cant stand, its a bully. Youve seen

them all your lifepeople who use their bigger size or better

social  standing  in  order  to  push  around  those  smaller  or

poorer than they are. Your fellow halings arent defenseless,

of course, but they prefer to deal with bullies by picking up

their stakes and leaving trouble behind. You, on the other

hand, are inclined to teach a bully a hard and lasting lesson.

After all, if you let a thug or a robber get away with push-

ing you around, the same will happen to the next person

to come around after you leave. If you demonstrate that it

can be dangerous to make enemies of halings, maybe the

bullies will think twice before they start trouble with the

small folk again.

While you are quite able to teach a lethal lesson when its

called for, you also keep a sense of proportional response. An

inuential human merchant who cheats a haling caravan

and then has the town guard drive off the camp hasnt killed

anybody. He deserves vengeance in the form of embarrass-

ment, theft, or exposure. In comparison, a gang of brigands

or orc marauders that sack a haling caravan should be made

to pay the ultimate price. While a dead brigand might not

learn much from your efforts, he wont repeat his crimes,

and his example might serve to dissuade other rufans and

robbers in the area.

Keep your eyes open and your blades close, but dont tip

your hand until its time to act. The deterrent you present is

made much more effective if you dont seem to be anything

other  than  an  ordinary  haling  adventurer.  Let  people

wonder whether all halings can ght with the stealth and

ferocity you possess. Itll be good for them to treat the small

folk with a little respect.

Combat

Youre an ambusher, most effective when you strike quickly

and avoid being trapped in a long, dangerous melee. Keep

moving, use your enemies for cover, and above all use your

abilities to create as many sneak attack opportunities as

possible. Get up close to enemies who are not skilled in

melee, such as wizards or sorcerers, and stay away from

enemies  who  can  beat  you  in  a  head-on  fight,  such  as

fighters or powerful monsters.

Your Rapid Shot feat and improved catch ability make you

very effective as a ranged sneak attack specialist. Remember,

halings gain a +1 attack bonus with thrown weapons; youre

at your best with a bandolier of daggers and an enemy stand-

ing 10 feet away. By the time you have a couple of levels in

whisperknife,  you  can  deliver  multiple  sneak  attacks  in  a

single round.

Advancement

Surprise  and  mobility  are

your  best  weapons  on

the battleeld. Look

for feats, skills, or

magic  items  that

add  to  these  capa-

bilities. Dodge and

Mobility help you

to  move  around

enemies  and

avoid  attacks

of  opportunity,

as  does  the  Tum-

ble skill. Improved

Initiative  increas-

es  your  chance

of  catching  a

foe at-footed at

the  beginning

of a ght and end-

ing  the  battle

before  the  oth-

er  fellow  even

knows it has start-

ed.  Your  Dexterity

score probably exceeds

your Strength score by a

fair margin, so Weapon

Finesse will make you a much better

melee combatant.

If you decide to take levels in classes other than whisper-

knife as you advance, you should strongly consider ranger,

ghter, or rogue. Ranger and ghter levels add more of the

feats that you will want to master, while rogue levels increase

your sneak attack damage faster.

Find yourself at least one dagger or similar light thrown

weapon with the returning special ability, and preferably

two or more. Youll never run out of things to throw as long

as at least one of them comes back each round.

Resources

Every haling settlement or caravan is your haven and your

retreat. Like a partisan or a guerrilla, you can move among

your  neighbors  and  kin,  hidden  from  the  eyes  of  your

enemies. Even halings who generally disapprove of your

methods will shelter you for a short time; they know how

important it is for halings to look out for each other.

Your  closest  allies  are  the  other  members  of  your

triangle  (see  below).  Even  if  you  go  for  a  long  time

without seeing these comrades, you should stay in touch

by  correspondence  or  by  leaving  messages  for  them

at  prearranged  places.  When

you need someone in the next

town over to dig into the truth

of a rumor or observe the

comings and goings of a

particular  person,  the

other  whisperknives

in  your  triangle  may

be able to help you. Of

course, you should

expect  to  do  the

same for them when

they request it.

Not  all  other

whisperknives

are  your  friends.

While  few  whisperknives

ever raise blades against each

other,  some  members  of  the

class are little more than se-

cretive  halfling  assassins,

willing to kill anyone if the

price is right. You share a sim-

ple  professional  courtesy  with

whisperknives whose methods and

motivation  differ  from  yours,  but

you certainly do not have to help

them  in  their  work,  nor  should

you expect them to help you in

yours.

WHISPERKNIVES

IN THE WORLD

Like  the  halflings  them-

selves, whisperknives present

a dichotomous face to the world. They are assassins in all

but name, frequently stalking and killing the enemies of

the haling race, but they are also courageous defenders

of their people. While some whisperknives lose their way

and become simple killers for hire, most save their blades

for those who have done (or intend to do) injury to other

halings. Many whisperknives submerge this hidden cause

within the career of an itinerant adventurer, keeping their

eyes open for dangers to the haling race as they wander

from land to land.

Organization

For generations, whisperknives have used an effective orga-

nizational structure: the triangle. Whisperknives gather in

You no longer provoke attacks of opportunity for attacking

with a thrown weapon (however, if you attack with a differ-

ent sort of ranged weapon, such as a bow, you still provoke

attacks of opportunity).

Improved Catch (Ex): Also at 3rd level, you become so

skilled with thrown weapons that you can take better advan-

tage of a weapon with the returning special ability. When

you make a ranged attack with a returning weapon, you can

move after the attack, and the weapon will still return to you

as long as line of sight between you and the weapon exists at

the beginning of your next turn.

Close Defense (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, you know how

to ght in a crowd of larger opponents. If you are adjacent

to  a  Medium  or  larger  foe,  you  gain  a  +2  dodge  bonus  to

Armor Class against attacks from all foes adjacent to you. If

the Medium or larger foe moves away or falls, you lose the

benet of close defense (although you might be able to move

next to the same foe again on your next turn and reestablish

it).  Enemies  making  ranged  attacks  or  attacks  with  reach

weapons arent affected by close defense.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 6th level, you have mastered

the art of unusually swift movement. Your land speed is

faster than the norm for halings by 10 feet. This benet

applies only when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or

medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this

bonus before modifying your speed because of any load

carried or armor worn.

Poison  Use  (Ex):  Starting  at  6th  level,  you  are  trained

in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning

yourself when applying poison to a blade.

Vengeful Strike (Su): Beginning at 7th level, as a standard

action you can execute a single vengeful strike in place of a

sneak attack. You coldly whisper the name of your intended

victim to your weapon, and then you make a single melee

or ranged attack. You gain a +2 morale bonus on the attack

roll. If you hit, your foe must make a Fortitude save (DC

10 + your class level + your Dex modier) or be stunned for

1d4 rounds.

You must know the victims name in order to make a

vengeful strike; that orc over there is not good enough.

Creatures without names (most creatures of Intelligence 2

or lower) are not subject to a vengeful strike. You usually use

this ability against a person or creature you know to have

harmed halings.

You can use this ability once per day at 7th level and three

times per day at 10th level.

Superior  Catch  (Ex):  When  you  reach  8th  level,  your

improved catch ability is extended. You can use two return-

ing weapons for two attacks each in a single round, or you

can use one returning weapon for three attacks in the same

round, as long as your target is no farther away than one range

increment.  (If  your  target  is  farther  away  than  one  range

increment, you can still use your superior catch ability, but

only for a single attack each turn.)

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): When you reach 9th

level, you can no longer be anked. See the barbarian class

feature, page 26 of the Players Handbook.

Ranged  Flank  (Ex):  At  9th  level,  you  know  how  to

flank a foe by using a ranged weapon. You must be within

10 feet of the enemy in question, and you flank as if you

were wielding a reach weapon (see Reach Weapons, page

137 of the Players Handbook). You do not threaten the foe

and may not make attacks of opportunity against the foe

unless you are actually adjacent to the foe and armed with

a melee weapon.

PLAYING A WHISPERKNIFE

If theres one thing you cant stand, its a bully. Youve seen

them all your lifepeople who use their bigger size or better

social  standing  in  order  to  push  around  those  smaller  or

poorer than they are. Your fellow halings arent defenseless,

of course, but they prefer to deal with bullies by picking up

their stakes and leaving trouble behind. You, on the other

hand, are inclined to teach a bully a hard and lasting lesson.

After all, if you let a thug or a robber get away with push-

ing you around, the same will happen to the next person

to come around after you leave. If you demonstrate that it

can be dangerous to make enemies of halings, maybe the

bullies will think twice before they start trouble with the

small folk again.

While you are quite able to teach a lethal lesson when its

called for, you also keep a sense of proportional response. An

inuential human merchant who cheats a haling caravan

and then has the town guard drive off the camp hasnt killed

anybody. He deserves vengeance in the form of embarrass-

ment, theft, or exposure. In comparison, a gang of brigands

or orc marauders that sack a haling caravan should be made

to pay the ultimate price. While a dead brigand might not

learn much from your efforts, he wont repeat his crimes,

and his example might serve to dissuade other rufans and

robbers in the area.

Keep your eyes open and your blades close, but dont tip

your hand until its time to act. The deterrent you present is

made much more effective if you dont seem to be anything

other  than  an  ordinary  haling  adventurer.  Let  people

wonder whether all halings can ght with the stealth and

ferocity you possess. Itll be good for them to treat the small

folk with a little respect.

small  fellowships  of  only  three  members.  Usually,  two  of

these  are  experienced  whisperknives,  and  the  third  is  an

aspiring candidate who is mentored by the other two. When

one whisperknife dies or moves on, the remaining members

of  the  triangle  seek  out  a  likely  new  membereither  a

solitary whisperknife looking for a triangle to join or a

promising new candidate. Triangles meet in secret and take

pains to avoid the discovery of any one of their members as

a whisperknife.

The purposes and training methods of the whisperknives

are  recorded  as  a  sort  of  code  or  tradition,  handed  down

from member to member over time. No grand society of

whisperknives exists to coordinate the activities of each

triangle, although the whisperknife traditions include vari-

ous signs and passwords by which a member of one triangle

can identify the member of a different one.

A whisperknife triangle is basically an association of

equals. Because the members rarely operate in concert, an

individual is free to pursue whatever calling or interests he

likes. It is not unusual for whisperknives to spend years away

from their fellow triangle members, engaged in their own

adventures and simply keeping in touch by the occasional

letter or message left at a favorite inn.

NPC Reactions

Since most people dont recognize the difference between

a  whisperknife  and  any  other  haling  rogue  or  ghter,

members of this prestige class generally provoke the same

sort of reactions that any haling adventurer would among a

particular community. In lands where halings are regarded

as lazy thieves and swindlers, a whisperknife is regarded

with an unfriendly attitude. In lands where halings are

thought of as pleasant (if sometimes larcenous) travelers and

neighbors, a whisperknife enters most encounters facing an

indifferent or even friendly attitude.

Other halings are of a mixed mind about whisperknives.

Some believe that the whisperknife is only borrowing trouble

for all halings, and they advocate retreat and avoidance

instead of confrontation. Other halings admire the cour-

age and skill of the whisperknife, and they believe that

whisperknives serve to deter the worst of the aggression

against the haling people. In general, a whisperknife can

expect a friendly reaction from other halings.

WHISPERKNIFE LORE

Characters with Knowledge (local) can undertake research

to  nd  out  more  about  whisperknife  triangles  that  might

be operating in a particular area and about whisperknives

in general. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following material, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC  10:  People  who  grievously  harm  roaming  haling

caravans have a tendency to turn up dead a little while later.

There  is  a  secret  society  of  haling  assassins  who  make  a

point of killing those who murder or rob other halings.

DC 15: These so-called assassins are known as whisper-

knives.  Some  are  actually  assassins,  and  they  kill  for

money.  Most  are  secret  defenders  of  the  halfling  race,

stealthy and ruthless blademasters who use their martial

skills to make other folk answer for injuries they do to

halflings.  Not  every  halfling  caravan  or  settlement  is

watched over by a whisperknife, but you never know which

ones are.

DC 20: Whisperknives always associate in triangles, or

groups of three. They rarely work together, but instead gather

to pass on the rites and traditions of the whisperknife and to

trade news of the enemies of halings. Whisperknives have

no overarching society or leadership beyond the traditions

of their calling.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success

can  learn  the  names  and  known  exploits  of  specific

whisperknives.

Contacting  a  whisperknife  is  not  easy  if  you  are  not

a  halfling.  Whisperknives  naturally  conceal  the  true

nature  of  their  vocation  from  any  nonhalfling,  passing

themselves off as scouts, rogues, or simply adventurers of

indeterminate sort. A DC 25 Gather Information check in

a halfling caravan or settlement puts a character seeking

a whisperknife in contact with a go-between who decides

whether to introduce the character to a whisperknife. A

halfling  who  attempts  this  Gather  Information  check

gains a +10 circumstance bonus; a check made in a settle-

ment without any significant halfling presence has a DC

of at least 35.

WHISPERKNIVES IN THE GAME

A whisperknife excels at looking like something less than

he is. You could easily introduce a whisperknife into your

campaign by creating an ally for the players who turns out

to be more skilled and dangerous than they expect. You

could present a whisperknife as a villain, an assassin who

intends to kill someone the PCs are duty bound to protect.

In a more sophisticated campaign, consider introducing

the  whisperknife  as  a  vigilante  whose  excesses  must

be checked.

The whisperknife prestige class appeals to players who

want to combine the stealth and exibility of the rogue

with the combat power of the ghter or ranger. It also offers

the opportunity to play against type, by creating a somber

and  serious  halfling  whos  more  interested  in  fighting

than subterfuge and who possesses a bit of a cruel streak,

at least when it comes to dealing with those he thinks of

as his enemies.

Adaptation

The whisperknife is a good class for any Small character; a

goblin  whisperknife  or  kobold  whisperknife  would  work

just as well as a haling whisperknife. You might choose to

make this class available to characters of Medium size, but

you should alter the close defense class feature to a crowd

defense ability that provides the same benet as long as the

character is adjacent to at least two enemies.

Encounters

The PCs inadvertently wander into a war in which a tri-

angle of whisperknives is bent on killing an evil merchant

lord. When the PCs stop for the night at an inn where one

of the whisperknives intends to attack one of the merchant

lords lieutenants, they find themselves in the middle of

a battle in which its not clear whos a friend and who is

an enemy.

EL 10: Geren Eastwind has stalked Herath, a cleric of

St. Cuthbert, to the Inn of the Four Corners, a crossroads

in  the middle of the  wilderness. Herath,  an inflexible

and stern man but not necessarily an evil one, oversaw

the  execution  of  a  relative  of  Gerens  who  was  caught

stealing  in  a  human  town.  Now  Geren  intends  to  slay

Herath in return. If the PCs intervene and prevent Geren

from killing Herath, the whisperknife marks them as his

next targets.

Languages: Common, Haling.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Geren  deals  an  extra  2d6  points

of damage on any successful attack against at-footed or

anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies

to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Crea-

tures  with  concealment,  creatures  without  discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Geren may

choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack,

but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Close Defense (Ex): If Geren is adjacent to an opponent

of Medium size or larger, he gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor

Class against attacks by all adjacent foes.

Defensive Throw (Ex): Geren does not provoke attacks

of opportunity when attacking with a thrown weapon.

Evasion (Ex): If Geren is exposed to any effect that nor-

mally allows him to attempt a Reex save for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Improved Catch (Ex): When Geren makes a full attack

with a returning weapon against a target within one range

increment, the weapon returns to him even if he moves after

making the attack.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Geren cannot be anked

and can only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least

10 levels of rogue.

Rapid Shot: Geren is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat

when he throws light weapons.

Trapnding  (Ex):  Geren  can  nd,  disarm,  or  bypass

traps  with  a  DC  of  20  or  higher.  He  can  use  the  Search

skill to nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Possessions:  +1  mithral  chain  shirt,  +1  returning  dagger,  +1

dagger, 4 masterwork daggers, masterwork silvered dagger,

masterwork cold iron dagger, potion of bulls strength, potion

of cats grace, potion of cure light wounds.

WILDRUNNER

The land nourishes my soul. It gives my feet wings and makes my

spirit soar. Thanks to the land I am the watcher unseen, the runner

unheard, and the tracker unerring. To the enemies of the land I am

death unseen and unrelenting.

Finleia Luthiamne, Pack Leader of the

Keepers of the High Vale

Wildrunners give themselves almost wholly to nature, seek-

ing to return to their untamed roots and eventually become

fey creatures. Though seemingly barbaric, wildrunners retain

their civilized learning and judgment while tapping into the

primal forces within themselves and within the land. Some

wildrunners  choose  to  live  after  the  fashion  of  untamed

animals,  unfettered  and  beholden  to  nothing  but  their

own desires and their fundamental needs. Most, however,

become guardians of the land and of the communities that

gave them birth.

BECOMING A WILDRUNNER

The  ranger  class  is  the  easiest  path  to  becoming  a  wild-

runner; all the required skills are class skills for rangers,

and  the  wildrunners  abilities  will  make  you  a  better

in general. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following material, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC  10:  People  who  grievously  harm  roaming  haling

caravans have a tendency to turn up dead a little while later.

There  is  a  secret  society  of  haling  assassins  who  make  a

point of killing those who murder or rob other halings.

DC 15: These so-called assassins are known as whisper-

knives.  Some  are  actually  assassins,  and  they  kill  for

money.  Most  are  secret  defenders  of  the  halfling  race,

stealthy and ruthless blademasters who use their martial

skills to make other folk answer for injuries they do to

halflings.  Not  every  halfling  caravan  or  settlement  is

watched over by a whisperknife, but you never know which

ones are.

DC 20: Whisperknives always associate in triangles, or

groups of three. They rarely work together, but instead gather

to pass on the rites and traditions of the whisperknife and to

trade news of the enemies of halings. Whisperknives have

no overarching society or leadership beyond the traditions

of their calling.

DC  30:  Characters  who  achieve  this  level  of  success

can  learn  the  names  and  known  exploits  of  specific

whisperknives.

Contacting  a  whisperknife  is  not  easy  if  you  are  not

a  halfling.  Whisperknives  naturally  conceal  the  true

nature  of  their  vocation  from  any  nonhalfling,  passing

themselves off as scouts, rogues, or simply adventurers of

indeterminate sort. A DC 25 Gather Information check in

a halfling caravan or settlement puts a character seeking

a whisperknife in contact with a go-between who decides

whether to introduce the character to a whisperknife. A

halfling  who  attempts  this  Gather  Information  check

gains a +10 circumstance bonus; a check made in a settle-

ment without any significant halfling presence has a DC

of at least 35.

WHISPERKNIVES IN THE GAME

A whisperknife excels at looking like something less than

he is. You could easily introduce a whisperknife into your

campaign by creating an ally for the players who turns out

to be more skilled and dangerous than they expect. You

could present a whisperknife as a villain, an assassin who

intends to kill someone the PCs are duty bound to protect.

In a more sophisticated campaign, consider introducing

the  whisperknife  as  a  vigilante  whose  excesses  must

be checked.

The whisperknife prestige class appeals to players who

want to combine the stealth and exibility of the rogue

with the combat power of the ghter or ranger. It also offers

the opportunity to play against type, by creating a somber

and  serious  halfling  whos  more  interested  in  fighting

than subterfuge and who possesses a bit of a cruel streak,

at least when it comes to dealing with those he thinks of

as his enemies.

Adaptation

The whisperknife is a good class for any Small character; a

goblin  whisperknife  or  kobold  whisperknife  would  work

just as well as a haling whisperknife. You might choose to

make this class available to characters of Medium size, but

you should alter the close defense class feature to a crowd

defense ability that provides the same benet as long as the

character is adjacent to at least two enemies.

Encounters

The PCs inadvertently wander into a war in which a tri-

angle of whisperknives is bent on killing an evil merchant

lord. When the PCs stop for the night at an inn where one

of the whisperknives intends to attack one of the merchant

lords lieutenants, they find themselves in the middle of

a battle in which its not clear whos a friend and who is

an enemy.

EL 10: Geren Eastwind has stalked Herath, a cleric of

St. Cuthbert, to the Inn of the Four Corners, a crossroads

in  the middle of the  wilderness. Herath,  an inflexible

and stern man but not necessarily an evil one, oversaw

the  execution  of  a  relative  of  Gerens  who  was  caught

stealing  in  a  human  town.  Now  Geren  intends  to  slay

Herath in return. If the PCs intervene and prevent Geren

from killing Herath, the whisperknife marks them as his

next targets.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  Geren  deals  an  extra  2d6  points

of damage on any successful attack against at-footed or

anked targets, or against a target that has been denied its

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies

to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Crea-

tures  with  concealment,  creatures  without  discernible

anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Geren may

choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack,

but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Close Defense (Ex): If Geren is adjacent to an opponent

of Medium size or larger, he gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor

Class against attacks by all adjacent foes.

Defensive Throw (Ex): Geren does not provoke attacks

of opportunity when attacking with a thrown weapon.

Evasion (Ex): If Geren is exposed to any effect that nor-

mally allows him to attempt a Reex save for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Improved Catch (Ex): When Geren makes a full attack

with a returning weapon against a target within one range

increment, the weapon returns to him even if he moves after

making the attack.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Geren cannot be anked

and can only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least

10 levels of rogue.

Rapid Shot: Geren is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat

when he throws light weapons.

Trapnding  (Ex):  Geren  can  nd,  disarm,  or  bypass

traps  with  a  DC  of  20  or  higher.  He  can  use  the  Search

skill to nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic

traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If his

Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more,

he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or

disarming it.

Possessions:  +1  mithral  chain  shirt,  +1  returning  dagger,  +1

dagger, 4 masterwork daggers, masterwork silvered dagger,

masterwork cold iron dagger, potion of bulls strength, potion

of cats grace, potion of cure light wounds.

WILDRUNNER

The land nourishes my soul. It gives my feet wings and makes my

spirit soar. Thanks to the land I am the watcher unseen, the runner

unheard, and the tracker unerring. To the enemies of the land I am

death unseen and unrelenting.

Finleia Luthiamne, Pack Leader of the

Keepers of the High Vale

Wildrunners give themselves almost wholly to nature, seek-

ing to return to their untamed roots and eventually become

fey creatures. Though seemingly barbaric, wildrunners retain

their civilized learning and judgment while tapping into the

primal forces within themselves and within the land. Some

wildrunners  choose  to  live  after  the  fashion  of  untamed

animals,  unfettered  and  beholden  to  nothing  but  their

own desires and their fundamental needs. Most, however,

become guardians of the land and of the communities that

gave them birth.

BECOMING A WILDRUNNER

The  ranger  class  is  the  easiest  path  to  becoming  a  wild-

runner; all the required skills are class skills for rangers,

and  the  wildrunners  abilities  will  make  you  a  better

CLASS FEATURES

As  you  advance  in  level,  you  gain  abilities  that  aid  you  in

mastering the environment and making you self-sufcient

in the wild.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: You gain no prociency

with any weapons or armor. If you wear heavy armor, you do

not benet from your fast movement ability.

Fast Movement (Ex): Your land speed is faster than the

norm for your race by 10 feet while wearing light, medium, or

no armor. This increase stacks with similar increases, such as

that from the barbarian class. See the barbarian class feature,

page 25 of the Players Handbook.

Trackless  Step  (Ex):  You  cannot  be  tracked  in  natural

surroundings.  See  the  druid  class  feature,  page  36  of  the

Players Handbook.

Primal Scream (Su): At 2nd level, you become able to

bring  forth  the  power  inherent  within  and  release  it  in  a

blood-chilling scream. Releasing a primal scream is a free

action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A primal

scream induces a state of feral frenzy that lasts for a number

of rounds equal to 3 + your Con modier (minimum 1). You

can use your primal scream ability a number of times per

day equal to 3 + your Cha modier (minimum 1). Using a

primal scream always requires you to shout, so you cannot

use a primal scream if you cannot speak.

In this frenzy, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength and a +6

bonus to Dexterity. In addition, your jaw elongates and your

teeth become razor-sharp; you gain a bite attack that deals

1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small, or 1d8 if you are

Large). You can wield a weapon in one or both hands at your

normal attack bonus and make a secondary bite attack, but

in that case the bite attack takes a 5 attack penalty (or 2

with the Multiattack feat).

In  addition  to  these  effects,  a  primal  scream  confers

additional benets as you gain levels, as described below. All

effects are cumulative.

Enemies Shaken: Starting at 4th level, your primal scream

makes enemies within 30 feet shaken when you activate

the  ability.  This  is  a  sonic,  mind-affecting  fear  effect.

Creatures in the area must make Will saves (DC 10 + your

class level + your Cha modifier). On a failed save, a creature

is shaken for a number of rounds equal to your class level.

Creatures  with  more  Hit  Dice  than  you  are  immune  to

this effect.

Pounce: At 6th level, you gain the ability to pounce on an

opponent in the round in which you activate your primal

scream. If you charge a foe in the same round that you scream,

you may make a full attack, instead of the normal single attack

allowed after a charge.

Enemies Cower: Beginning at 8th level, your primal scream

can  immobilize  enemies  with  fear  when  you  activate  the

ability. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. It functions

like the enemies shaken ability described above, except that

any enemy with less than half your Hit Dice that fails its Will

save is cowering instead of shaken.

Fast Healing: At 10th level, when you activate your primal

scream you gain fast healing 5 for the duration of your feral

frenzy, as long as you have at least 1 hit point.

If you also have the rage class feature, you can rage and use

your primal scream at the same time, gaining the benets of

both abilities.

Scent (Ex): At 2nd level, you learn to rely on senses that

most other people never even suspect. You gain the scent

special ability. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by

sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases

to 60 feet; if the opponent is downwind, it drops to 15 feet.

You do not detect the exact location of the sourceonly its

presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action

to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within

5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the sources location.

Endure Elements (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, you can use

endure elements on yourself at will. Your caster level is equal

to your wildrunner class level.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): Beginning at 5th level, you

can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being

observed. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the Players

Handbook.

Unfettered Stride (Ex): At 7th level, you gain the ability to

move through or across a variety of terrain features without it

affecting your movement or skill checks. This ability applies

to bogs, rubble, undergrowth, ice sheets, and natural stone

oors. See Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for

the effect of terrain on movement and skill checks.

Feyheart:  At  9th  level,  your  mystic  bond  with

nature changes your very being. Your type becomes

fey (augmented humanoid), and you gain damage

reduction 2/cold iron.

PLAYING A

WILDRUNNER

You  are  never  complete-

ly  at  ease  outside  the

wilderness. Many wild-

runners  carry  some

token brought from a

familiar haunt. It could

be something trivial such as a vial

of sand from a favorite spot along a

river, a leaf or ower from a pleas-

ant glade, or perhaps a feather from

a native bird. It could be something

more  practical,  such  as  a  staff

or  bow  made  from  wood

harvested in your home

forest or a tinderbox with

a  bit  of  int  from  the

hills of home.

When  adventur-

ing  anywhere,  stay

in  touch  with  whats

happening  around

you.  Observe  the

local plants, animals,

or people, including the people

in your party. Try to ascertain what has happened recently,

what the conditions are right now, and what might happen

next. You might express your interest in your surroundings

actively by being curious as a cat or passively, like a deer listen-

ing for trouble. In all cases, try to be sensitive to the moods

in the people you meet and make some reaction to them.

You might avoid or try to soothe an angry comrade, calm a

fearful villager, or bring a braggart down a few notches.

Above  all,  take  an  active  role  in  whatever  situation  you

discover, even if all you do is ee from it. Wildrunners are

learned and civilized, but theyve worked hard to uncover

the feral aspects of their natures, and they seldom deal with

anything passively.

Combat

Your primal scream abilities are what set you apart from

other characters, so use them aggressively. It doesnt pay to

squander your limited daily uses of this power, but theres

no prize for nishing the day with uses left over, either.

Youll  seldom  have  a  combat  encounter  in  which  your

primal scream doesnt prove useful. A primal scream is a

free action, so you have little excuse not to use itunless

the situation calls for stealth.

Early  in  your  career, look for foes you can  isolate  or

defeat  quickly  (much

as  a  hungry  predator

chooses a weaker mem-

ber  of  the  herd  as  a  target

when  hunting  for  food).  This

method has the virtue of thin-

ning  out  the  opposition

while  minimizing  the

risk  to  yourself;  both  can

prove important when youre just

starting out in the class, because

youre probably fairly lightly armored

and you havent had much time to build

up a high natural armor bonus. Concen-

trate on one foe at a time, attack until

the foe falls or ees, then move on

to the next. When you have felled

your  lesser  opponents,

join  the  attack  on  your

chief  foe,  if  there  is  one.

As  your  level  increases,

you  can  use  your  extra

speed  and  your  hide

in  plain  sight  ability  to

maneuver  around  the

battleeld  and  strike

where youll prove the

most effective.

As  you  gain  more  pri-

mal scream abilities, youll

gain  the  power  to  thwart  or

eliminate multiple foes at once, and youll have a chance to

knock out leaders or singularly powerful foes. When you

gain  your  fast  healing  primal  scream  at  10th  level,  you

develop  great  staying  power  in  a  ght.  Just  dont  get  too

cockyyou have to be conscious to use your fast healing.

Advancement

Becoming a wildrunner is usually a matter of personal choice.

All wildrunners within a particular area customarily form a

loosely organized pack with the oldest or most experienced

wildrunner serving as the nominal leader. These wildrun-

ners generally keep a close watch on potential new members,

teaching  them  survival  skills  and  nurturing  their  love  of

nature and of the land. Any character who shows the aptitude

to become a wildrunner is welcomed as at least an informal

member of the pack, but all new members are expected to

come to the pack of their own accord. Packs do not actively

recruit new members.

Youll  seldom  have  a  combat  encounter  in  which  your

primal scream doesnt prove useful. A primal scream is a

free action, so you have little excuse not to use itunless

the situation calls for stealth.

Early  in  your  career, look for foes you can  isolate  or

defeat  quickly  (much

as  a  hungry  predator

chooses a weaker mem-

ber  of  the  herd  as  a  target

when  hunting  for  food).  This

method has the virtue of thin-

ning  out  the  opposition

while  minimizing  the

risk  to  yourself;  both  can

prove important when youre just

starting out in the class, because

youre probably fairly lightly armored

and you havent had much time to build

up a high natural armor bonus. Concen-

trate on one foe at a time, attack until

the foe falls or ees, then move on

to the next. When you have felled

your  lesser  opponents,

join  the  attack  on  your

chief  foe,  if  there  is  one.

As  your  level  increases,

you  can  use  your  extra

speed  and  your  hide

in  plain  sight  ability  to

maneuver  around  the

battleeld  and  strike

where youll prove the

most effective.

As  you  gain  more  pri-

mal scream abilities, youll

gain  the  power  to  thwart  or

eliminate multiple foes at once, and youll have a chance to

knock out leaders or singularly powerful foes. When you

gain  your  fast  healing  primal  scream  at  10th  level,  you

develop  great  staying  power  in  a  ght.  Just  dont  get  too

cockyyou have to be conscious to use your fast healing.

Advancement

Becoming a wildrunner is usually a matter of personal choice.

All wildrunners within a particular area customarily form a

loosely organized pack with the oldest or most experienced

wildrunner serving as the nominal leader. These wildrun-

ners generally keep a close watch on potential new members,

teaching  them  survival  skills  and  nurturing  their  love  of

nature and of the land. Any character who shows the aptitude

to become a wildrunner is welcomed as at least an informal

member of the pack, but all new members are expected to

come to the pack of their own accord. Packs do not actively

recruit new members.

141

Anii Windhair, a wildrunner

A new member is often introduced to the pack in a simple

ceremony in which the pack members gather during a moon-

lit night to meet the new member. As a matter of tradition,

only a few pack members introduce themselves to the new

member, and these members serve as advisors and mentors

to the newcomer. All pack members who are present get a

good look at the new member and learn his name, but do not

show themselves. This practice allows the established pack

members to remain anonymous yet still able to identify the

new member by sight.

The new members mentors often take the character on a

tour of the packs territory and explain any ongoing concerns

or projects the pack might have, such as guarding a settle-

ment,  gathering  information  on  newcomers  to  the  area,

or watching the movements of a potential enemy. Mostly,

however, the new member is left alone but asked to share

anything he learns with the rest of the pack and to lend a

hand when the need arises.

As you attain higher levels in the wildrunner prestige

class, youll want to focus on the skills and abilities that

help you use your class features to best advantage. Ranks

in  Hide  and  Move  Silently  are  necessary  to  take  full

advantage of your hide in plain sight ability. Listen and

Spot help you avoid the embarrassment of being ambushed

in your home terrain.

Youll  do  well  with  a  defensive  item  that  can  negate  or

reduce hits against you, such as a cloak of displacement, or even

a potion of blur or displacement (drink the potion in the round

Resources

When  a  new  wildrunner  is  introduced  to  a  pack,  his

mentors can provide him with information and access to

a network of an unknown number of allies (other pack

members) who can aid the character in numerous ways

(when they feel inclined). Most wildrunner packs have

informal links with other packs throughout the land, and

a wildrunners mentors can send word out whenever the

wildrunner has an errand that takes him away from home.

So no matter where a wildrunner goes, he can  nd help in

unexpected places.

WILDRUNNERS IN THE WORLD

Wildrunners can be found almost anywhere, from the depths

of trackless forests to the tops of remote mountains, and PCs

who venture into the wilderness can meet them anywhere.

Theres  no  telling  whether  a  modest  hunter  or  eccentric

mountaineer is merely a commoner eking out a living in the

wild or a powerful NPC wearing a humble guise.

Organization

Wildrunner  packs  might  have  anywhere  from  a  few

members to several dozen, depending on the size of their

territory. A packs territory usually covers a single well-

de ned  geographical  locale,  such  as  a  particular  forest,

mountain, or watershed, and usually not more than  fty

miles across.

Ordinarily, pack members have little to do with each oth-

er unless there is a new member to induct or some threat

to the land develops. The pack members

exchange  news  and  talk  whenever

they  happen  to  meet,  and  smaller

groups  of  close

may dwell together or at least meet often. They spend their

days re ecting on their own inner natures and honing their

outdoor skills. As part of their commitment to the land, they

defend it against invaders and despoilers. Many packs de-

vote themselves to guarding highways, trails, settlements,

tombs, or areas of exceptional natural beauty.

Wildrunners might maintain a secret presence in a sparsely

settled area, where they pose as farmers, artisans, hunters,

trappers, or woodcutters. These secret wildrunners work at

their vocations at least part time but also take time to wander

the wilds and enjoy nature.

Packs often choose names for their groups based on their

location and avowed purpose, such as The Wardens of the

High Forest, Guardians of the Golden River, or People of the

Hollow Hills.

The  position  of  pack  leader  is  largely  an  honori c  that

carries no real privileges or authority except what the pack

leader can command by virtue of her personal accomplish-

ments or strength of will. A pack leader with a particularly

strong will and sense of purpose can form her pack into a

powerful force.

NPC Reactions

Druids and rangers tend to think well of wildrunners, mostly

because wildrunners usually share a similar mind-set and

suite of skills with druids and rangers. Evil druids and rang-

ers usually have little in common with wildrunners except

their  ability  to  get  along  in  the  wild.  Wildrunners  often

are the  rst to detect and block schemes that evil druids or

rangers hatch.

Barbarians often admire wildrunners for their free-spir-

ited ways and their ability to survive in the wild, but many

barbarians regard wildrunners as sneaky or evasive.  Most

barbarians  nd a wildrunners devotion to nature at least a

little bit crazy.

Elves and hal ings generally honor wildrunners for their

accomplishments and stewardship of the land. Wild elves

in particular  nd a wildrunners return to his primal roots

noteworthy and admirable. Raptorans agree that wildrun-

ners have accomplished much, but they dont regard that as

anything special; still, they welcome wildrunners as people

who have learned to live with nature.

WILDRUNNER LORE

Characters with Knowledge (nature) can research wildrun-

ners to learn more about them. When a character makes a skill

check, read or paraphrase the following material, including

the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Many pristine wildernesses are haunted by wood-

land warriors known as wildrunners. Wildrunners forsake

civilization and society. They have the keen senses and blind

 ghting fury of wild predators.

DC  15:  Groups  of  wildrunners  are  called  packs,  and

they usually include all the wildrunners in a certain locale.

Wildrunner packs are loosely organized under a single leader

whose position is mostly honorary. The pack leader may rouse

the pack from time to time to accomplish some purpose but

otherwise has little real authority.

DC 20: Wildrunners serve as unof cial guardians of the

land where they live, and of all things that dwell there. They

usually oppose any attempts to tame or clear wild lands

but may support limited and prudent efforts to extract

wild resources.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about the speci c packs in your

campaign, including notable members and what tasks they

choose to undertake.

PCs trying to establish contact with a pack of wildrunners

can make a DC 20 Gather Information check to discover the

necessary intermediaries or meeting places. Just talking to a

wildrunner encountered in the wild might work, or it might

not, because few members of a pack know the identities of

members senior to them.

WILDRUNNERS IN THE GAME

As a rustic character free from the burdens and concerns of

civilization, a wildrunner can provide the DM with many

entertaining roleplaying opportunities. A wildrunner can

provide struggling PCs with useful guidance or information

and can help the DM advance an adventures plot.

A wildrunner who has completely reverted to his animal

nature might stalk and attack PCs just as any other preda-

tor might do, forcing the PCs to deal with an intelligent

and  capable  foe  that  thinks  of  them  as  nothing  more

than prey.

Because they keep mostly to themselves and sometimes

work undercover, its easy to add wildrunners to an ongoing

campaigntheyve been there all along, going about their

business unbeknownst to the PCs.

This prestige class appeals to players who like to re ect on

how their characters think and what they do when theyre

not  adventuring,  and  to  players  who  understand  outdoor

life. A wildrunner also has a few secrets to keep from other

characters, and that can prove irresistible to some players.

When a player decides to enter the wildrunner class, prepare

one or two NPCs who can serve as the PCs mentors, and give

some  thought  to  the  setting  and  mood  for  the  characters

acceptance  ceremony  (if  any).  A  secret  glade  deep  in  the

woods full of night sounds, a hidden cave  lled with ghostly

echoes, or similar setting works well.

Adaptation

The wildrunner class is suitable for characters of any race, and

you could adapt this class accordingly by simply dropping

the racial requirement. You might wish to limit the class to

certain tribes or regions in order to de ne a particular corner

of your campaign. The class would also work well for evil

wilderness warriors; a clan of murderous orc wildrunners

would make for memorable foes indeed.

Encounters

Player characters might encounter wildrunners when they

travel to some locale theyve never visited before. The local

wildrunners would be quick to study the PCs and to test

their mettle.

EL  9:  Anii  Windhair  has  finished  a  day  of  hunting

and has settled down near the place where the PCs have

decided to camp for the night. To test the partys mettle,

Anii sneaks into their camp using his hide in plain sight

ability. Whether he is caught or chooses to reveal himself,

he pretends to take a liking to some moderately valuable

item a PC has and proposes to fight a duel over it. Anii is

quite impressed if the PCs simply give it up. If the PCs

wish to fight, he offers to provide a bearskin if he loses.

If the PCs accept, Anii proposes a nonlethal duel with no

holds barred in all other respects. He ghts the best he can

with the PC or with a champion the challenged character

designates. If the PCs try to gang up on him, Anii does

his best to escape. If he loses a fair ght, Anii leaves and

returns a few hours later, leading an angry bear that is very

much alive.

he distinctive cultures of the elves, halings, and

raptorans spawn characters with abilities beyond

those described in the Players Handbook. The fol-

lowing feats and new rules for skills are designed

with the races of the wild in mind.

Moving through Trees: Use Balance checks to move hori-

zontally along a branch or tree trunk leaning over at an

angle of up to 60 degrees. To move vertically in a tree, or

to move along a branch or trunk with an angle of greater

than 60 degrees, use the Climb skill.

SKILLS

Elves, halings, and raptorans have found endless ways to

make use of what they know. Sometimes, it is their unique

outlook that leads them to approach tasks in remarkable

ways. Other times they must invent special techniques to

suit their particular needs.

The following section describes new uses for the skills

described in the Players Handbook. Unless otherwise noted,

there are no special requirements for the new skill uses

described here. Where members of a particular race are

mentioned, it is merely to point out who pioneered the

new use and does not limit who can use the skill in this

new manner.

BALANCE (DEX; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)

Life in the wild often obliges elves and raptorans to perch in

or move through the tops of trees. Halings, too, often nd

themselves precariously balanced somewhere.

Forest Type

Dense Forest: Trees are older with strong

branches and are close together, including

many massive trees. There are lots of

branches to choose from, letting the character

select the widest, flattest branches with the

most support or hand holds.

Medium Forest: Trees are farther apart or

not as old and the selection of branches

is not as great, forcing the character to

use some narrow branches or branches

without support.

Sparse Forest: Trees are farther apart and

not very old. The character has to use a

lot of narrow branches without support or

hand holds. The character is often moving

across branches that are barely wide

enough to move on.

Only when running or charging. Failure by 4

or less means the character cant run or charge but

may otherwise act normally. The character is not

considered balancing when not moving.

Only when running or charging. Failure by 4 or less means

the character cant run or charge but may otherwise act

normally. The character is not considered balancing when

not moving.

CLIMB (STR; ARMOR CHECK PENALTY)

Sometimes, the best way to move around a treetop or other

area that offers good handholds but unsteady footing is to

climb. You can use the Climb skill to move horizontally or

vertically. Climbing always requires you to use both hands;

if you decide to swing along using only your hands (like an

ape), you use the Climb skill to do so. Very strong characters

may nd climbing safer than balancing, if slower.

Check: A successful Climb check allows you to move up,

down, or across a forest canopy at one-quarter your normal

speed. Typical DCs are as follows:

Climb

DC

0

5

10

15

20

Example Activity

Grasping nearby branches to move along a

branch too narrow or too steeply angled for

normal walking

Climbing a tree with plenty of sturdy branches for

handholds and footholds

Climbing a tree with few or fairly weak branches

Climbing a tree trunk with no branches but small

enough to clasp with the arms

Climbing a tree trunk with no branches and too

large to clasp with the arms

Catching Characters Falling out of Trees: If you fall when

climbing, you can try to catch yourself on the way down;

you also can try to catch another character who falls. Its

much easier to catch yourself or another falling character

up in a trees canopy, where there are plenty of branches to

grab, than when climbing a wall or sheer cliff (as described on

page 69 of the Players Handbook), so the Climb check to stop

the fall is slightly easier (DC equal to the trees or branchs

DC + 5).

Wandering halings often rely on their animals for transpor-

tation and defense, and halings have developed many ways

to get the most from their animals. Many elves and raptorans

have also honed their animal handling techniques.

These techniques include tricks and general purposes that

anyone with the Handle Animal skill can teach to animals.

For a full description of teaching an animal a trick or training

it for a purpose, see page 74 of the Players Handbook.

Teach an Animal a Trick: You can teach an animal a spe-

cic trick with one week of work and a successful Handle

Animal check against the indicated DC. The following

tricks expand upon those presented on pages 7475 of the

Players Handbook.

Ambush (DC 20): The animal hides, using the Hide skill

to the best of its ability. It then stays hidden and attacks

the rst foe to come close enough for the animal to attack

after a single move. The animal must know the attack trick

to learn this trick, and it will attack only those kinds of

creatures it has been trained to attack and that it recognizes

as foes.

The animal will not attack creatures that are familiar

to it (such as members of its owners party) or harmless

creatures that it would not otherwise attack (such as birds

or squirrels).

You can specify a kind of creature to attack each time you

command an animal to perform the ambush trick. Doing

this requires a DC 20 Handle Animal check, and you must

convey your desire to the animal somehow. If the animal

has the scent ability, you can supply the animal with the

scent (for example, from a piece of discarded clothing or

equipment).  You  also  can  show  the  animal  the  kind  of

creature you want ambushed (by pointing to the creature

in the distance or showing the animal a captive creature). A

speak with animals spell can be handy for designating a kind

of creature to ambush.

You can specify a location for the ambush instead of the kind

of creature. Doing this also requires a DC 20 Handle Animal

check. The place you designate must be a place the animal can

reach by taking a single move action, and the animal must be

able to see it when you give the ambush command.

Bull Rush (DC 20): The animal attempts to bull rush a

designated creature. The animal must know the attack trick

to learn this trick, and it will bull rush only those kinds of

creatures it has been trained to attack. This trick otherwise

works just like the attack trick.

Disarm (DC 20): The animal attempts to disarm a des-

ignated creature. The animal must know the attack trick

to learn this trick, and it will disarm only those kinds of

creatures it has been trained to attack. You designate some

item the subject holds or carries, and the animal will try to

seize that item. If given no other instructions, the animal

attempts to make the subject drop any weapon it holds.

146

If the animal uses a bite attack (or some other natural

weapon  that  allows  it  to  grasp  an  object),  it  winds  up

holding  the  target  item  in  its  mouth  (or  grasp)  after  a

successful disarm.

Mark (DC 20): The animal moves toward a creature you

designate and endeavors to stay near the creature no matter

what  it  does  or  how  it  moves.  The  animal  generally  stays

within 10 feet of the creature but keeps out of its reach. While

performing this trick, the creature makes noise to help mark

the foes location.

If the animal also knows the seek trick, you can designate

an area or direction for the animal to seek out foes that are

attacking you. To identify a foe,

the animal must see the creature

attack you or use a spell or

other  magical  effect  with

a visible manifestation in

your direction. Otherwise

the animal marks the rst

creature it encounters.

Overrun (DC 20): The

animal  attempts  to  over-

run a designated creature,

provided  the  animal  is  big

enough to do so. If the animal

has the trample special ability,

it uses that ability against the

creature  if  the  animal  is

big enough to do so.

Train  an  Animal  for  a

Purpose: Rather than teach-

ing  an animal individual

tricks,  you  can  train  it

for a general purpose. The fol-

lowing  general  purposes  expand

upon  those  presented  on  page  75  of

the Players Handbook.

Helpmate  (DC  20):  An  animal  helpmate

serves you or a creature you designate, acting

as a companion, guard, and assistant. It knows

the tricks come, down, fetch, guard, heel, and

stay. Training an animal to be a helpmate takes six weeks.

Herding (DC 20): The animal knows how to drive groups of

other animals from place to place and how to keep individu-

als from wandering away from the herd. It knows the tricks

come, down, guard, heel, mark, and seek. Training a herding

animal takes six weeks.

Rescue (DC 15): The animal knows how to nd and retrieve

hurt or incapacitated creatures. It knows the tricks fetch,

mark, seek, track, and work. Training a rescue animal takes

ve weeks.

SURVIVAL (WIS)

Elves and raptorans have developed many techniques for get-

ting along the wild. Halings have developed similar methods

for making do when traveling between settlements.

Create Trail Signs: You can leave brief messages for anyone

following you or using your route after you pass by.

To create a message, you make marks in the ground, pile up

rocks or twigs, bend plants into unusual shapes, or perform

some other fairly subtle alteration of the landscape. Halings

make use of simple drawings, which they scratch into the

ground or on some object with a sharp implement or draw

with a piece of chalk or charcoal.

Very  simple  messages,  such  as  Go  this

way or Dont go this way, are fairly easy to

convey (DC 10). More complex messages, such

as Walk west three days, then turn left at the

bluff, have a DC of 15. In general, a message

that could be written in four words or less

has a DC of 10, and messages of five to ten

words have a DC of 15. Failure by 4 or less

means the signs you leave dont get the mes-

sage across. Failure by 5 or more means that

the signs convey some false information

(see below).

Finding Trail Signs: Once trail signs

are in place, anyone passing through

the area where you left them can

nd them with a DC 10 Survival

or  Spot  check.  You  can  make

them easier or more difcult

to nd. Making the signs big

or putting them in an obvious

place sets the DC lower (DC 5 or

DC 0). Similarly, you can make

the  signs  difficult  to  find  by

hiding them. In this case, make

a Survival check to set the DC

for nding the signs, but the

minimum DC remains 10.

Older signs are harder to

nd, and poor visibility can

make trail signs more difcult

to locate, as indicated below.

If  the  character  who  placed  trail  signs  failed  his  or  her

check  and  created  meaningless  signs,  you  can  still  try  to

read them. The DC is the same as the DC to create the signs;

if you succeed, you know the signs are meaningless. If you

fail by 4 or less, you cannot make sense of the signs. If you

fail by 5 or more, you perceive an incorrect message.

Action: Creating trail signs requires a full-round action

that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Locating trail signs usually is reactive; when you have

a chance to notice trail signs, you can make a Survival or

Spot check without using an action. However, if you know

or suspect someone has left trail signs in a certain area, you

can use a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area;

this requires you to use the Search skill, with the same DC

as the Survival DC to locate the signs.

Reading trail signs requires a standard action that does not

provoke attacks of opportunity.

Try Again: If you fail to create or read trail signs, you

cannot try again. If you fail a reactive check to find trail

signs  someone  else  has  left,  you  cannot  try  again  (you

simply pass by the signs). When using the Search skill to

locate signs that you know or suspect are present, you can

try again.

FEATS

This section contains new feats that embody the strengths

and abilities of the races of the wild. Some of the feats listed

here  are  more  appropriate  for  elves,  halings,  raptorans,

If  the  character  who  placed  trail  signs  failed  his  or  her

check  and  created  meaningless  signs,  you  can  still  try  to

read them. The DC is the same as the DC to create the signs;

if you succeed, you know the signs are meaningless. If you

fail by 4 or less, you cannot make sense of the signs. If you

fail by 5 or more, you perceive an incorrect message.

Action: Creating trail signs requires a full-round action

that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Locating trail signs usually is reactive; when you have

a chance to notice trail signs, you can make a Survival or

Spot check without using an action. However, if you know

or suspect someone has left trail signs in a certain area, you

can use a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area;

this requires you to use the Search skill, with the same DC

as the Survival DC to locate the signs.

Reading trail signs requires a standard action that does not

provoke attacks of opportunity.

Try Again: If you fail to create or read trail signs, you

cannot try again. If you fail a reactive check to find trail

signs  someone  else  has  left,  you  cannot  try  again  (you

simply pass by the signs). When using the Search skill to

locate signs that you know or suspect are present, you can

try again.

FEATS

This section contains new feats that embody the strengths

and abilities of the races of the wild. Some of the feats listed

here  are  more  appropriate  for  elves,  halings,  raptorans,

and  the  other  races  of  the  wild  than  they  are  for  other

races, but even characters of other races will nd several

intriguing options.

In  addition,  after  you  make  this  attack  you  can  choose,

When you have the opportunity to concentrate on a task, you

usually do very well at it.

Prerequisites: Elf, Concentration 2 ranks.

Bene  t: When you take 10 or take 20 on an Intelligence

Bene  t: When you are manifesting the aspect of the

ancient (see page 103), you can spend 10 minutes of

uninterrupted  time  communing  with

no ranks in the Knowledge skill in question.

KILLOREN DESTROYER

You favor the killoren aspect of the destroyer.

Prerequisite: Killoren.

Bene  t:  When  you  are  manifesting  the  aspect  of  the

character level + your Cha modi er) or be dazed for 1 round.

Prerequisite: Killoren.

Bene  t:  When  you  are  manifesting  the  aspect  of  the

You ignore any penalties on your Move Silently checks

incurred by noisy or very noisy terrain (see the Move Silently

skill description, page 79 of the Players Handbook).

MAGIC OF THE LAND

Your  intimate  understanding  of  the  natural  world  allows

you  to  imbue  your  spells  with  life-giving  magical  power

from the land itself.

Prerequisites: Concentration 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature)

5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks, caster level 1st.

Benefit: When in a natural setting, you can draw on

the power of the land to imbue your spells with

healing power. For the purpose of this

feat, a natural setting is defined as

any location not within a commu-

nity  and  not  a  constructed

area.  Natural  setting  in-

cludes unworked caverns,

but not crafted dungeons

and the like.

To use the feat, you must

succeed on a Knowledge

(nature)  check  (DC  15

+  spell  level),  made  as  a

free  action  while  casting

a spell. You cant take 10

on this check. If you suc-

ceed,  each  target  of  your

spell is healed of 2 points

of damage per spell level,

in addition to the spells

normal  effects.  If  the

spell doesnt have a target

entry, this feat has no ef-

fect. This healing power

is positive energy, so an

undead creature instead

takes 2 points of damage

per spell level. An unwill-

ing creature can attempt a

Will save (at the spells nor-

mal save DC) to negate this effect. If the skill check fails,

the prepared spell or spell slot is lost.

You cannot use this feat on any spell with an alignment

descriptor, nor with any necromancy spell. The natural world

favors balance in all things, and thus does not support specic

alignment-based magic, nor can its life-giving power be used

to enhance the magic of death.

SHARED FURY

Your  fearsome  rage  spurs  your  animal  companion  to

greater heights.

Prerequisites: Handle Animal 4 ranks, animal companion

class feature, rage class feature.

Benet: When you rage, your animal companion gains

the same benets and penalties from your rage that you do,

but only if it is within 5 feet of you. The companions rage

ends when your rage ends, or as soon as you are no longer

within 5 feet of your companion.

UNDERFOOT COMBAT

You  can  enter  the  space  that  a  foe  at

least two size categories bigger than

you occupies.

Prerequisites: Small or smaller,

Tumble 10 ranks.

Benet: You can move into

or through a square occupied by

a creature at least two size cat-

egories larger than you. You

do  not  provoke  attacks  of

opportunity for doing so.

While you are in a square

occupied by a creature at least

two  size  categories  larger

than you, you gain the benet

of soft cover (+4 bonus to AC)

against  all  attacks,  including

those  of  the  creature  whose

space you occupy.

Normal: Without this feat,

you can move through squares

occupied by a creature at least

three  size  categories  larger

than  you,  or  a  creature  three

size categories smaller than you

(or any creature, if you are Tiny

or smaller).

The Underfoot Combat feat allows Lidda to nip at an ettins ankles

YONDALLAS SENSE

You display a shrewd perception of danger. Other halings

say the blessing of Yondalla is upon you.

Prerequisite: Haling.

Benefit:  You  add  your  Wisdom  bonus  on  initiative

checks.

PLUNGING SHOT

You can use the force of gravity to make your ranged attacks

deal extra damage if your target is below you.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.

Benet: If your target is at least 30 feet lower than you,

you  deal  an  extra  1d6  points  of  damage  with  a  thrown  or

projectile weapon.

TACTICAL FEATS

First  introduced  in  Complete  Warrior,  tactical  feats  allow

characters to use a variety of powerful offensive or defensive

maneuvers in combat.

If youre playing a character who has a tactical feat, its your

responsibility to keep track of the actions youre perform-

ing as you set up the maneuver that the feat enables you to

152

perform. Its also a good idea to briey mention to the DM

that youre working toward performing a tactical maneuver;

a remark along the lines of I move into the trolls square,

using the Underfoot Combat feat, and thats the rst step in

a tactical maneuver is appropriate.

Some of the tactical feats refer to the rst round, second

round,  and  so  on.  These  terms  refer  to  the  timing  of  the

maneuver, not the battle as a whole.

CONFOUND THE BIG FOLK

[TACTICAL]

You excel when battling foes bigger than you are.

Prerequisites: Small or smaller, Tumble 10 ranks, Under-

foot Combat.

Benet: This feat allows you to perform any of the follow-

ing three maneuvers.

Knee Striker: To use this maneuver, you must rst move

into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories

larger than you. On the next round, the foe is automatically

considered at-footed against your attacks, and you gain a

+4 bonus on any roll you make to conrm a critical hit.

Underfoot Defense: To use this maneuver, you must rst

move  into  a  square  occupied  by  a  foe  at  least  two  size

categories larger than you. On any succeeding round in

which you remain in the foes square and ght defensively,

use total defense, or use Combat Expertise (minimum 1

penalty on attack rolls), any melee or ranged attack made

against you has a 50% chance to strike the foe whose square

you occupy instead. This chance does not apply to attacks

made by the creature whose square you occupy.

Unsteady Footing: To use this maneuver, you must rst move

into  a  square  occupied  by  a  foe  at  least  two  size  categories

larger than you. On the next round, you can use a standard

action to attempt to trip your foe without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If your touch attack to initiate the trip attack

succeeds, you can attempt a Strength or Dexterity check (your

choice) opposed by your foes Strength or Dexterity check (as

normal) to trip your foe. Your foe may not add any bonus on his

Strength or Dexterity check to avoid the trip that he would gain

from his size. If your trip check fails, your opponent may not

attempt to trip you. If you have Improved Trip, you can follow

a successful trip attempt with an immediate melee attack.

WINGED WARRIOR [TACTICAL]

You use your wings for more than just ying.

Prerequisites: Hover, must have wings, base attack

bonus  +4.

Benet: The Winged Warrior feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers.

Dustup: To use this maneuver, you must be standing in, or

ying no more than 10 feet above, an area with a lot of loose

debris. If you ap your wings hard as a move action, the draft

creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 20 feet. Clear

vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures 11 to

20 feet away have concealment. At over 20 feet, creatures have

total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed

on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level)

to cast a spell.

Flying Leap: To use this maneuver, you must move a distance

greater than your base land speed during the round. If you

do, you gain a +4 bonus on Jump, Balance, and Climb checks

because your wings give you lift and stabilize you.

Shroud of Feathers: To use this maneuver, you must spend a

move action to pull your wings around your body. You cannot

be ying during this maneuver. You can then attempt to feint

in combat (as described in the Bluff skill description, page

68 of the Players Handbook) as part of your attack, suddenly

spreading your wings to reveal your weapon just as its about

to land a blow. The shroud of feathers maneuver works on a

given foe only once per combat.

Special:  The  Hover  feat  (see  page  304  of  the  Monster

Manual) grants creatures of Large size or larger a bigger dust

cloud than that granted with the dustup maneuver.

Special: A ghter may select Winged Warrior as one of

his ghter bonus feats.

WOLFPACK [TACTICAL]

You can gain an extra advantage when you and your allies

can gang up on a foe.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack,

base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  You  can  use  the  following  maneuvers  with

this feat.

Distract Foe: You begin this maneuver when you and at least

one ally ank a foe. On the rst round, you and your allies

gain normal anking bonuses (+2 on attack rolls).

Starting in the second round that you and at least one

ally ank a foe, you can make a ferocious attack that forces

the foe to concentrate on you and largely ignore your allies.

You make a melee attack as a full-round action. If you hit,

you make a special Bluff check as a free action; the damage

your attack dealt applies as a bonus on your check. The foe

you attack opposes your attack with a special Sense Motive

check, adding her base attack bonus to the check. If you

win the opposed check, your foe turns her attention to you,

and each of your allies who are in position to give you a

anking bonus can make an attack of opportunity against

that foe.

Drive Back: To use this maneuver, you and at least one ally

must threaten the same foe, and at least one of those allies

must  use  the  aid  another  action  to  assist  your  attack  roll.

You make a melee attack as a full-round action. If you hit,

you make a free bull rush attempt without moving into the

defenders space or provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve

the bull rush normally, except that you add the damage your

attack dealt as a bonus on the Strength check you make to

resolve the bull rush. You cant push an opponent back more

than 5 feet with this maneuver.

Gang  Dodge:  This  maneuver  allows  you  to  use  the  aid

another action to assist all allies who threaten the same

foe you target with the action. You use a standard action as

normal to aid an allys defense (see the Aid Another special

You ignore any penalties on your Move Silently checks

incurred by noisy or very noisy terrain (see the Move Silently

skill description, page 79 of the Players Handbook).

MAGIC OF THE LAND

Your  intimate  understanding  of  the  natural  world  allows

you  to  imbue  your  spells  with  life-giving  magical  power

from the land itself.

Prerequisites: Concentration 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature)

5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks, caster level 1st.

Benefit: When in a natural setting, you can draw on

the power of the land to imbue your spells with

healing power. For the purpose of this

feat, a natural setting is defined as

any location not within a commu-

nity  and  not  a  constructed

area.  Natural  setting  in-

cludes unworked caverns,

but not crafted dungeons

and the like.

To use the feat, you must

succeed on a Knowledge

(nature)  check  (DC  15

+  spell  level),  made  as  a

free  action  while  casting

a spell. You cant take 10

on this check. If you suc-

ceed,  each  target  of  your

spell is healed of 2 points

of damage per spell level,

in addition to the spells

normal  effects.  If  the

spell doesnt have a target

entry, this feat has no ef-

fect. This healing power

is positive energy, so an

undead creature instead

takes 2 points of damage

per spell level. An unwill-

ing creature can attempt a

Will save (at the spells nor-

mal save DC) to negate this effect. If the skill check fails,

the prepared spell or spell slot is lost.

You cannot use this feat on any spell with an alignment

descriptor, nor with any necromancy spell. The natural world

favors balance in all things, and thus does not support specic

alignment-based magic, nor can its life-giving power be used

to enhance the magic of death.

SHARED FURY

Your  fearsome  rage  spurs  your  animal  companion  to

greater heights.

Prerequisites: Handle Animal 4 ranks, animal companion

class feature, rage class feature.

Benet: When you rage, your animal companion gains

the same benets and penalties from your rage that you do,

but only if it is within 5 feet of you. The companions rage

ends when your rage ends, or as soon as you are no longer

within 5 feet of your companion.

UNDERFOOT COMBAT

You  can  enter  the  space  that  a  foe  at

least two size categories bigger than

you occupies.

Prerequisites: Small or smaller,

Tumble 10 ranks.

Benet: You can move into

or through a square occupied by

a creature at least two size cat-

egories larger than you. You

do  not  provoke  attacks  of

opportunity for doing so.

While you are in a square

occupied by a creature at least

two  size  categories  larger

than you, you gain the benet

of soft cover (+4 bonus to AC)

against  all  attacks,  including

those  of  the  creature  whose

space you occupy.

Normal: Without this feat,

you can move through squares

occupied by a creature at least

three  size  categories  larger

than  you,  or  a  creature  three

size categories smaller than you

(or any creature, if you are Tiny

or smaller).

The Underfoot Combat feat allows Lidda to nip at an ettins ankles

YONDALLAS SENSE

You display a shrewd perception of danger. Other halings

say the blessing of Yondalla is upon you.

Prerequisite: Haling.

Benefit:  You  add  your  Wisdom  bonus  on  initiative

checks.

PLUNGING SHOT

You can use the force of gravity to make your ranged attacks

deal extra damage if your target is below you.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Point Blank Shot.

Benet: If your target is at least 30 feet lower than you,

you  deal  an  extra  1d6  points  of  damage  with  a  thrown  or

projectile weapon.

TACTICAL FEATS

First  introduced  in  Complete  Warrior,  tactical  feats  allow

characters to use a variety of powerful offensive or defensive

maneuvers in combat.

If youre playing a character who has a tactical feat, its your

responsibility to keep track of the actions youre perform-

ing as you set up the maneuver that the feat enables you to

152

perform. Its also a good idea to briey mention to the DM

that youre working toward performing a tactical maneuver;

a remark along the lines of I move into the trolls square,

using the Underfoot Combat feat, and thats the rst step in

a tactical maneuver is appropriate.

Some of the tactical feats refer to the rst round, second

round,  and  so  on.  These  terms  refer  to  the  timing  of  the

maneuver, not the battle as a whole.

CONFOUND THE BIG FOLK

[TACTICAL]

You excel when battling foes bigger than you are.

Prerequisites: Small or smaller, Tumble 10 ranks, Under-

foot Combat.

Benet: This feat allows you to perform any of the follow-

ing three maneuvers.

Knee Striker: To use this maneuver, you must rst move

into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories

larger than you. On the next round, the foe is automatically

considered at-footed against your attacks, and you gain a

+4 bonus on any roll you make to conrm a critical hit.

Underfoot Defense: To use this maneuver, you must rst

move  into  a  square  occupied  by  a  foe  at  least  two  size

categories larger than you. On any succeeding round in

which you remain in the foes square and ght defensively,

use total defense, or use Combat Expertise (minimum 1

penalty on attack rolls), any melee or ranged attack made

against you has a 50% chance to strike the foe whose square

you occupy instead. This chance does not apply to attacks

made by the creature whose square you occupy.

Unsteady Footing: To use this maneuver, you must rst move

into  a  square  occupied  by  a  foe  at  least  two  size  categories

larger than you. On the next round, you can use a standard

action to attempt to trip your foe without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If your touch attack to initiate the trip attack

succeeds, you can attempt a Strength or Dexterity check (your

choice) opposed by your foes Strength or Dexterity check (as

normal) to trip your foe. Your foe may not add any bonus on his

Strength or Dexterity check to avoid the trip that he would gain

from his size. If your trip check fails, your opponent may not

attempt to trip you. If you have Improved Trip, you can follow

a successful trip attempt with an immediate melee attack.

WINGED WARRIOR [TACTICAL]

You use your wings for more than just ying.

Prerequisites: Hover, must have wings, base attack

bonus  +4.

Benet: The Winged Warrior feat enables the use of three

tactical maneuvers.

Dustup: To use this maneuver, you must be standing in, or

ying no more than 10 feet above, an area with a lot of loose

debris. If you ap your wings hard as a move action, the draft

creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 20 feet. Clear

vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures 11 to

20 feet away have concealment. At over 20 feet, creatures have

total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed

on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level)

to cast a spell.

Flying Leap: To use this maneuver, you must move a distance

greater than your base land speed during the round. If you

do, you gain a +4 bonus on Jump, Balance, and Climb checks

because your wings give you lift and stabilize you.

Shroud of Feathers: To use this maneuver, you must spend a

move action to pull your wings around your body. You cannot

be ying during this maneuver. You can then attempt to feint

in combat (as described in the Bluff skill description, page

68 of the Players Handbook) as part of your attack, suddenly

spreading your wings to reveal your weapon just as its about

to land a blow. The shroud of feathers maneuver works on a

given foe only once per combat.

Special:  The  Hover  feat  (see  page  304  of  the  Monster

Manual) grants creatures of Large size or larger a bigger dust

cloud than that granted with the dustup maneuver.

Special: A ghter may select Winged Warrior as one of

his ghter bonus feats.

WOLFPACK [TACTICAL]

You can gain an extra advantage when you and your allies

can gang up on a foe.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack,

base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  You  can  use  the  following  maneuvers  with

this feat.

Distract Foe: You begin this maneuver when you and at least

one ally ank a foe. On the rst round, you and your allies

gain normal anking bonuses (+2 on attack rolls).

Starting in the second round that you and at least one

ally ank a foe, you can make a ferocious attack that forces

the foe to concentrate on you and largely ignore your allies.

You make a melee attack as a full-round action. If you hit,

you make a special Bluff check as a free action; the damage

you attack opposes your attack with a special Sense Motive

check, adding her base attack bonus to the check. If you

win the opposed check, your foe turns her attention to you,

and each of your allies who are in position to give you a

anking bonus can make an attack of opportunity against

that foe.

Drive Back: To use this maneuver, you and at least one ally

must threaten the same foe, and at least one of those allies

must  use  the  aid  another  action  to  assist  your  attack  roll.

Players Handbook). If you

succeed, all your allies who

threaten your foe gain a +2 bonus

to AC against that foes attacks until the

beginning of your next turn, provided

that you continue to threaten that foe for that time.

WOODLAND ARCHER [TACTICAL]

You have honed your archery ability in the wilds of the forest.

Prerequisites: Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: The Woodland Archer feat enables the use of

three tactical maneuvers.

Adjust for Range: To use this maneuver, you must shoot a

projectile weapon against a foe and miss. Subsequent shots

you take against that foe this round gain a +4 bonus, because

youre able to quickly adjust your aim to compensate.

Pierce the Foliage: To use this maneuver, you must hit a foe

with a ranged attack despite the miss chance caused by con-

cealment. Shots you take against that foe in the next round

dont incur the miss chance because youre able to exactly

duplicate your draw and aim.

Moving Sniper: To use this maneuver, you must succeed on

a sniping attack (see the Hide skill description, page 76 of

the Players Handbook), both hitting your intended target and

successfully hiding thereafter. If no one sees you, you can

make a sniping attack again in the following round, taking a

single move after your attack and before you hide (characters

without this feat can only shoot and hide, not move as well).

As long as you continue to hit the target and avoid detection

from an enemy, you can make a sniping attack on the move

each round.

Special: A  ghter may select Woodland Archer as one of

his  ghter bonus feats.

RACIAL

SUBSTITUTION LEVELS

A substitution level is a level of a given class that you take

instead of the level described for the standard class. Selecting

a substitution level is not the same as multiclassingyou

remain within the class for which the substitution level

is taken. The class features of the substitution level simply

replace those of the standard level.

To qualify to take a racial substitution level, you must be

of the proper race. For instance, to select a racial substitution

level of elf wizard, you must be an elf.

The three races featured in this bookelf, hal ing, and

raptoraneach have racial substitution levels for three

classes. Essentially, each set of substitution levels presents

a racially  avored variant standard class for your game. The

DM can add more racial substitution level options (such as

for an elf bard or a hal ing ranger) as desired, using the ones

presented here as guidelines.

For each class with racial substitution levels, you can select

each substitution level only at a speci c class level. When you

take a substitution level for your class at a given level, you give

up the class features gained at that level for the standard class,

and you get the substitution level features instead. You cant

go back and gain the class features for the level you swapped

outwhen you take your next level in the standard class, you

gain the next higher level as if you had gained the previous

level normally.

For instance, if you take the elf paladin substitution level

for 3rd level, you forever lose the class features normally

gained by a standard 3rd-level paladin (such as aura of cour-

age), gaining instead the racial substitution class features

for  a  3rd-level  elf  paladin  (such  as  aura  of  freedom;  see

Table 62). When you gain another level in paladin, you

gain the normal 4th-level bene ts of the standard paladin

class, as given in Table 312: The Paladin, page 43 of the

Players Handbook.

Unless  noted  otherwise  in  the  description  of  a  racial

substitution  level  class  feature,  a  character  who  takes  a

racial substitution level gains spellcasting ability (increases

in spells per day and spells known, if applicable) as if she had

taken this level in the standard class.

A character need not take all the substitution levels pro-

vided for a class. For instance, a hal ing rogue might decide

to take only the racial substitution level at 1st level, ignoring

the other substitution levels.

The  description  of  each  substitution  level  class  feature

explains what occurs to the standard class ability not gained,

if that ability would normally increase at a speci c rate (such

as the paladins smite evil ability).

When a substitution level changes the standard classs

Hit Die or class skill list, the change applies only to that

speci c substitution level, not to any other class levels. A

hal ing who takes the hal ing monk substitution level as a

beginning character gains 6 hit points (from the substitution

levels d6 Hit Die) and gains an additional 1d6 hit points for

each additional hal ing monk substitution level she takes

later in her career, but she gains the normal d8 Hit Die for

all standard monk levels.

ELF PALADIN

Though  elves  typically  tend  toward  chaos  and  freedom

over law and order, an elf paladin can become a beacon

of righteousness. He gives up some of his single-minded

dedication in exchange for abilities that work well with his

racial aptitudes.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

Class Features

All  the  following  are  features  of  the  elf  paladins  racial

substitution levels.

Ranged Smite Evil (Su): An elf paladin can only deliver

his smite evil attacks with a longbow (or composite longbow)

or shortbow (or composite shortbow). The target must be

within 30 feet for the paladin to use this ability. This ability

otherwise functions identically to the normal smite evil class

feature described on page 44 of the Players Handbook.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladins

class feature of smite evil. At each level at which the paladin

would normally gain an additional daily use of smite evil, the

elf paladin instead gains a daily use of ranged smite evil.

Aura of Freedom (Su): A 3rd-level elf paladin radiates an

aura that helps his allies resist effects that would in uence

their minds. Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4 morale

bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. This

ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if

he is unconscious or dead.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladins

ability of aura of courage.

Unicorn Mount (Sp): A 5th-level elf paladin gains the

service of a unicorn to serve him in his crusade against evil.

This ability is identical to the paladins special mount class

feature, except that the paladin is treated as six levels lower

than  normal  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  mounts

bonus HD, natural armor adjustment, and Strength adjust-

ment (but not other special abilities). The unicorn serves as

a loyal steed regardless of the paladins gender.

For example, an elf paladins unicorn mount doesnt gain

the adjusted statistics of a 5th-level paladins mount (+2 HD, +4

natural armor adjustment, and +1 Strength adjustmentsee

page  45  of  the  Players  Handbook)  until  the  paladin  is  11th

level. It gains the other special abilities of a paladins mount

at the normal levels (empathic link, improved evasion, share

spells, and share saving throws at 5th level, improved speed at

8th level, command at 11th level, and spell resistance at 15th

level). The unicorn mount may only use its command ability

on horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladins

class feature of special mount.

To take an elf paladin substitution level, a character must be

an elf about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of paladin.

ELF RANGER

Class Skills

Elf paladin substitution levels grant the same class skills as

the standard paladin class, plus Survival.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four times

The elf ranger combines sylvan grace with deadly skill,

moving effortlessly through the wilds in search of his prey.

He isnt quite as tough as a typical ranger but enjoys extra

bonuses against his races favored enemies and can befriend

You have honed your archery ability in the wilds of the forest.

Prerequisites: Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: The Woodland Archer feat enables the use of

the adjusted statistics of a 5th-level paladins mount (+2 HD, +4

natural armor adjustment, and +1 Strength adjustmentsee

page  45  of  the  Players  Handbook)  until  the  paladin  is  11th

level. It gains the other special abilities of a paladins mount

at the normal levels (empathic link, improved evasion, share

spells, and share saving throws at 5th level, improved speed at

8th level, command at 11th level, and spell resistance at 15th

level). The unicorn mount may only use its command ability

on horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladins

class feature of special mount.

To take an elf paladin substitution level, a character must be

an elf about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of paladin.

ELF RANGER

Elf paladin substitution levels grant the same class skills as

enemy, these bonuses rise to +3. Servants of Lolth includes

drow, monstrous spiders of all sizes, and driders; this is an

addition to the normal list of options for a rangers favored

enemy found on page 47 of the Players Handbook.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  rangers

1st-level favored enemy class feature.

This substitution feature also affects the elf rangers later

improvements to his favored enemy ability. Each time an

elf ranger gains a new favored enemy, he can increase the

bonus for one favored enemy by 2, or by 3 if he chooses to

increase his bonus against orcs, undead, or the servants

of Lolth.

Elven Hound Companion (Ex): A 4th-level elf ranger can

select an elven hound (see page 189) as his animal companion,

even though the creature is a magical beast. For the purpose

of any of the rangers spells that affect animals, as well as his

use of Handle Animal or wild empathy on the companion,

the elven hound is treated as an animal.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rangers 10th-

level third favored enemy class feature, as well as the additional

+2 (or +3) bonus against an existing favored enemy. The elf

ranger instead gains his third favored enemy at 15th level.

ELF WIZARD

Elves are naturally enthralled by the study of magic, and

many of historys most famous wizards were elves. Elf wizards

typically prefer a general approach to magic, recognizing the

value in versatility.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take an elf wizard substitution level, a character must be

an elf about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of wizard.

Class Skills

Elf wizard substitution levels grant the same class skills as

the standard wizard class, plus Search.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four times

this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the elf wizards racial sub-

stitution levels.

Generalist Wizardry: A 1st-level elf wizard begins play

with one extra 1st-level spell in her spellbook. At each new

wizard level, she gains one extra spell of any spell level that

she can cast. This represents the additional elven insight and

experience with arcane magic.

The elf wizard may also prepare one additional spell of

her highest spell level each day. Unlike the specialist wizard

ability, this spell may be of any school.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  wizards

ability to specialize in a school of magic.

Natural Link (Su): At 3rd level, an elf wizards link to her

familiar strengthens. The bonus on skill checks, saves, or hit

points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat

familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently

checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus

on Re ex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants

+6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies

when the familiar is within arms reach of the wizard; when

the creature is farther away than that, the normal bonus

applies (unless the familiar is more than one mile away, in

which case no bonus applies, as described on page 52 in the

Players Handbook).

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  wizard

familiars ability to deliver touch spells (normally gained by

the familiar of a 3rd-level wizard) and the familiars ability

to speak with animals of its kind (normally gained by the

familiar of a 7th-level wizard). If the wizards familiar already

has either of these abilities (for instance, if the character is a

multiclass sorcerer/wizard), it loses those abilities when the

wizard selects this substitution level.

Bonus  Feat:  At  5th  level,  an  elf  wizard  gains  a  bonus

feat, chosen from the following list: Defensive Archery, Far

Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, or Weapon

Focus (longbow/composite longbow or shortbow/composite

shortbow only). The wizard must still meet all prerequisites

for a bonus feat.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  wizards

bonus feat gained at 5th level.

HALFLING DRUID

The hal ing druid often follows a more pragmatic approach

in exploring his link to the natural world. He gives up some

of his innate ability to summon allies, while strengthening

his bond with his animal companion (which is commonly

used as a mount by the otherwise slow-moving hal ing).

His  expanded  skill  selection  allows  him  to  serve  as  a

capable scout.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To take a hal ing druid substitution level, a character must be

a hal ing about to take his 1st, 5th, or 13th level of druid.

Class Skills

Hal ing druid substitution levels grant the same class skills

as the standard druid class, plus Climb, Hide, Jump, and

Move Silently.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er (or four times

this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the hal ing druids racial

substitution levels.

Spontaneous Casting: Hal ing druids often use their

animal companions as mounts, and they have developed a

method of enhancing their animal companions mobility and

defenses by channeling their own spell energy.

even though the creature is a magical beast. For the purpose

points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat

familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently

checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus

on Re ex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants

+6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies

when the familiar is within arms reach of the wizard; when

A  hal ing  druid  can  channel  stored  spell  energy  into

speci c spells that he hasnt prepared ahead of time. He can

lose a prepared spell to cast any spell from the following list

of the same level or lower, but he may only target himself or

his animal companion with the spell (if it has a target). For

example, a hal ing druid who has prepared call lightning (a

3rd-level spell) may lose call lightning to cast protection from

energy, spider climb, or jump, but may only target himself or his

animal companion with the spell. (A hal ing druids ability

to share spells with his animal companion works normally

with these spells.)

1st: jump

2nd: spider climb

3rd: protection from energy

4th: freedom of movement

5th: tree stride

6th: summon natures ally VI

7th: summon natures ally VII

8th: summon natures ally VIII

9th: summon natures ally IX

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  druids

ability of spontaneous casting.

Enhanced Link (Ex): In addition to the normal bene ts

gained  by  the  druids  link  to  his  animal  companion,  a

hal ing druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Ride

checks made in conjunction with his animal companion. He

takes no penalty for riding his animal companion without

a saddle.

In addition, as long as the hal ing druid rides his animal

companion, his animal companion shares the druids wood-

land stride and trackless step class features (assuming the

druid has these class features).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace,

the standard druids link class feature (described on page 36

of the Players Handbook).

Undersized Wild Shape (Su): A hal ing druids Small

size limits his wild shape ability (including his elemental

wild shape and any other wild shape options he gains from

feats or other special abilities), reducing them by one size

category. However, he can use his wild shape ability one

additional time per day (2/day at 5th level, 3/day at 6th, 4/day

at 7th, and so forth).

At  5th  level,  a  hal ing  druid  gains  the  ability  to  turn

himself into any Tiny or Small animal. He gains wild shape

(Medium) at 8th level, wild shape (Diminutive) at 11th level,

and wild shape (Large) at 15th level.

At 16th level, he gains the ability to use wild shape to

transform into a Tiny, Small, or Medium elemental; he can

transform into a Large elemental at 20th level.

This class feature is otherwise identical to the standard

druids wild shape ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druids wild

shape ability.

Camou  age (Ex): A hal ing druid of 13th level or higher

can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if

the terrain doesnt grant cover or concealment.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druids a

thousand faces class feature.

HALFLING MONK

Monk seems a counterintuitive selection for the hal ing at

 rst glance, since the hal ing incurs signi cant penalties to

her ability to deal damage in melee because of her Small size.

A hal ing monk, however, can learn to focus on mobility

and eventually even neutralize some of the larger creatures

advantages over her.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a hal ing monk substitution level, a character must be

a hal ing about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 7th level of monk.

A hal ing monk who selects any racial substitution level

for her monk class can freely multiclass between the monk

and rogue classes.

Class Skills

Hal ing monk substitution levels grant the same class skills

as the standard monk class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er (or four times

this number as a beginning character).

All the following are features of the hal ing monks racial

substitution levels.

Skirmish (Ex): A hal ing monk relies on mobility to

deal extra damage and improve her defense. At 1st level, a

hal ing monk deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all

attacks during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet.

The extra damage applies only to attacks made with unarmed

strikes or special monk weapons (that is, the weapons a

normal monk can use as part of a  urry of blows; see page

40 of the Players Handbook), and only on attacks taken during

the monks turn. This bonus increases to an extra 2d6 points

of damage at 11th level.

The extra damage only applies against a living creature

with a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants,

incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage.

The monk must be able to see the target well enough to pick

out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Hal ing

monks can apply this additional damage to ranged attacks

made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within

30 feet.

At 5th level, the monk also gains a +1 competence bonus to

Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10

feet. The bonus applies as soon as the monk has moved 10 feet,

and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves

to +2 at 15th level.

The monk loses this

ability when wearing

armor  or  when  car-

rying  a  medium  or

heavy load.

This substitution

feature replaces the

standard  monks

 urry  of  blows

Hal ing druid

ability. A hal ing monk who selects this substitution level

gains no bene t from any feature that improves or augments

the  urry of blows class feature (such as the 11th-level monks

greater  urry ability).

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, a hal ing monk gains Weapon

Finesse as a bonus feat.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  monks

bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

Size  Matters  Not  (Ex):  At  7th  level,  a  hal ing  monk

learns to neutralize some of the natural advantage gained

by particularly large opponents.

A hal ing monk with Improved Grapple gains a +4 bonus

on grapple checks made against opponents at least two size

categories larger than herself. This is in addition to the +4

bonus granted by the feat.

A  hal ing  monk  with  Stunning  Fist  gains  a  +4  bonus

on her stunning  st DC for stunning attacks made against

opponents at least two size categories larger than herself.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  monks

wholeness of body ability gained at 7th level.

HALFLING ROGUE

A hal ing takes to life as a rogue as if born to ita claim

with which many other races would readily agree. A half-

ling rogue gives up some of her prowess in melee combat in

exchange for increased

talent with thrown

weapons  and  an

extra  touch  of

hal ing luck.

A  hal ing  druid  can  channel  stored  spell  energy  into

speci c spells that he hasnt prepared ahead of time. He can

lose a prepared spell to cast any spell from the following list

of the same level or lower, but he may only target himself or

his animal companion with the spell (if it has a target). For

example, a hal ing druid who has prepared call lightning (a

3rd-level spell) may lose call lightning to cast protection from

energy, spider climb, or jump, but may only target himself or his

animal companion with the spell. (A hal ing druids ability

to share spells with his animal companion works normally

with these spells.)

1st: jump

2nd: spider climb

3rd: protection from energy

4th: freedom of movement

5th: tree stride

6th: summon natures ally VI

7th: summon natures ally VII

8th: summon natures ally VIII

9th: summon natures ally IX

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  druids

ability of spontaneous casting.

Enhanced Link (Ex): In addition to the normal bene ts

gained  by  the  druids  link  to  his  animal  companion,  a

hal ing druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Ride

checks made in conjunction with his animal companion. He

takes no penalty for riding his animal companion without

a saddle.

In addition, as long as the hal ing druid rides his animal

companion, his animal companion shares the druids wood-

land stride and trackless step class features (assuming the

druid has these class features).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace,

the standard druids link class feature (described on page 36

of the Players Handbook).

Undersized Wild Shape (Su): A hal ing druids Small

size limits his wild shape ability (including his elemental

wild shape and any other wild shape options he gains from

feats or other special abilities), reducing them by one size

category. However, he can use his wild shape ability one

additional time per day (2/day at 5th level, 3/day at 6th, 4/day

at 7th, and so forth).

At  5th  level,  a  hal ing  druid  gains  the  ability  to  turn

himself into any Tiny or Small animal. He gains wild shape

(Medium) at 8th level, wild shape (Diminutive) at 11th level,

and wild shape (Large) at 15th level.

At 16th level, he gains the ability to use wild shape to

transform into a Tiny, Small, or Medium elemental; he can

transform into a Large elemental at 20th level.

This class feature is otherwise identical to the standard

druids wild shape ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druids wild

shape ability.

Camou  age (Ex): A hal ing druid of 13th level or higher

can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if

the terrain doesnt grant cover or concealment.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druids a

thousand faces class feature.

HALFLING MONK

Monk seems a counterintuitive selection for the hal ing at

 rst glance, since the hal ing incurs signi cant penalties to

her ability to deal damage in melee because of her Small size.

A hal ing monk, however, can learn to focus on mobility

and eventually even neutralize some of the larger creatures

advantages over her.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a hal ing monk substitution level, a character must be

a hal ing about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 7th level of monk.

A hal ing monk who selects any racial substitution level

for her monk class can freely multiclass between the monk

and rogue classes.

Class Skills

Hal ing monk substitution levels grant the same class skills

as the standard monk class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er (or four times

this number as a beginning character).

All the following are features of the hal ing monks racial

substitution levels.

Skirmish (Ex): A hal ing monk relies on mobility to

deal extra damage and improve her defense. At 1st level, a

hal ing monk deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all

attacks during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet.

The extra damage applies only to attacks made with unarmed

strikes or special monk weapons (that is, the weapons a

normal monk can use as part of a  urry of blows; see page

40 of the Players Handbook), and only on attacks taken during

the monks turn. This bonus increases to an extra 2d6 points

of damage at 11th level.

The extra damage only applies against a living creature

with a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants,

incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage

from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage.

The monk must be able to see the target well enough to pick

out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Hal ing

monks can apply this additional damage to ranged attacks

made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within

30 feet.

At 5th level, the monk also gains a +1 competence bonus to

Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10

feet. The bonus applies as soon as the monk has moved 10 feet,

and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves

to +2 at 15th level.

The monk loses this

ability when wearing

armor  or  when  car-

rying  a  medium  or

heavy load.

This substitution

feature replaces the

standard  monks

 urry  of  blows

Hal ing druid

ability. A hal ing monk who selects this substitution level

gains no bene t from any feature that improves or augments

the  urry of blows class feature (such as the 11th-level monks

greater  urry ability).

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, a hal ing monk gains Weapon

Finesse as a bonus feat.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  monks

bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

Size  Matters  Not  (Ex):  At  7th  level,  a  hal ing  monk

learns to neutralize some of the natural advantage gained

by particularly large opponents.

A hal ing monk with Improved Grapple gains a +4 bonus

on grapple checks made against opponents at least two size

categories larger than herself. This is in addition to the +4

bonus granted by the feat.

A  hal ing  monk  with  Stunning  Fist  gains  a  +4  bonus

on her stunning  st DC for stunning attacks made against

opponents at least two size categories larger than herself.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  monks

wholeness of body ability gained at 7th level.

HALFLING ROGUE

A hal ing takes to life as a rogue as if born to ita claim

with which many other races would readily agree. A half-

ling rogue gives up some of her prowess in melee combat in

exchange for increased

talent with thrown

weapons  and  an

extra  touch  of

hal ing luck.

To  take  a  halfling  rogue  substitution  level,  a  character

must be a halfling about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 10th level

of rogue.

Class Skills

Hal ing rogue substitution levels grant the same class skills

as the standard rogue class.

RAPTORAN CLERIC

The raptoran cleric gains extra powers from his dedication

to the pact made between his race and the denizens of the

Elemental Plane of Air. While not as combat-oriented as a

typical cleric, a raptoran cleric can bring powerful servants

of air to do his bidding.

Hit Die: d6.

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modi er (or four times

Requirements

this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the hal ing rogues racial

substitution levels.

Ranged Sneak Attack (Ex): A halfling rogue is par-

ticularly talented at delivering sneak attacks with slings

and thrown weapons. Whenever a hal ing rogue delivers a

ranged sneak attack with a thrown weapon or sling, she deals

an extra 1d6 points of damage. However, her melee sneak

attack damage is reduced by 1d6 (0 points of damage at 1st

level, an extra 1d6 points at 3rd level, an extra 2d6 points at

5th level, and so forth, to a maximum of an extra 9d6 points

at 19th level).

This ability doesnt give the hal ing rogue the ability to

deal sneak attack damage to creatures she otherwise couldnt

affect (whether due to their anatomy, concealment, range, or

any other reason).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace,

the standard rogues sneak attack ability.

Thiefs Luck (Ex): At 3rd level, a hal ing rogue gains a

second chance against certain dangers. She can reroll any

Re ex save she has just rolled. If she chooses to use this abil-

ity (which must be decided before the result of the original

save is known), she must abide by the second roll. She may

use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional

time per day for every three levels gained thereafter. She

cant use this ability more than once per round.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  rogues

ability of trap sense. A hal ing rogue with this substitution

feature never gains trap sense from rogue levels.

Sniping Mastery (Ex): A hal ing rogue who has hidden

at least 10 feet away from her target can make one or more

ranged  attacks,  then  immediately  hide  again  as  a  free

action. She takes only a 10 penalty on her Hide check

to do so (rather than the normal 20; see page 76 of the

Players Handbook).

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  rogues

special ability gained at 10th level.

To  take  a  raptoran  cleric  substitution  level,  a  character

must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 7th level

of cleric. A raptoran cleric must have selected either the

Air domain (see page 185 of the Players Handbook) or the

Sky domain (see page 174 of this book) to select a raptoran

cleric substitution level.

Class Skills

Raptoran cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills

as the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four times

this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the raptoran clerics racial

substitution levels.

Air Mastery (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, airborne crea-

tures take a 1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a

raptoran cleric.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  clerics

heavy armor pro ciency gained at 1st level.

Empathy of the Winds (Ex): A 1st-level raptoran cleric

gains a strong bond with air and its denizens. He learns

Auran as a bonus language (in addition to the languages

available to him because of his race and the Speak Language

skill).  He  gains  a  +4  circumstance  bonus  on  Diplomacy

checks made to interact with natives of the Elemental Plane

of Air. If he has the ability to bolster air creatures (such

as from the Air domain), he gains a +4 bonus on turning

checks made to do so. Allied air elementals within 60 feet

of the cleric gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and

damage rolls.

Air Summoning Talent (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a

raptoran cleric can summon certain creatures of air more

easily than other clerics can. Add the following monsters

to the list of creatures that the cleric can summon with the

appropriate summon monster spell:

Summon monster II: Small air elemental

Summon monster III: Air mephit

Summon monster IV: Medium air elemental

160

Raptoran cleric

Raptoran  ghter

Raptoran sorcerer

Summon monster V: Large air elemental

Summon monster VI: Huge air elemental

Summon monster VII: Greater air elemental

Summon monster VIII: Elder air elemental

This substitution feature removes all spells with the earth

descriptor from the standard clerics spell list. If a spell

would only have the earth descriptor due to a particular

version of the spell (such as a summon monster spell used

to summon an earth elemental), the spell remains on the

clerics spell list but the version with the earth descriptor

cannot be cast.

Open the Wind-Gate (Ex): A 7th-level raptoran cleric can

use the planar ally spells to call a more powerful air elemental

than would normally be allowed. The cleric can call an 8 HD

Large air elemental with lesser planar ally, a single 16 HD Huge

air elemental (or two 8 HD Large air elementals) with planar

ally, or a single 24 HD elder air elemental (or multiple Large

and/or Huge air elementals totaling 24 HD) with greater

planar ally.

The costs associated with these spells remain the same.

However, if any of the called air elementals die while in the

service of the cleric, the cleric loses access to this ability for

seven days and takes a 1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and

checks during that period.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  clerics

ability to call creatures other than air elementals with the

various planar ally spells.

RAPTORAN FIGHTER

The raptoran  ghter is a sentinel of the skies, swooping on

foes and bringing death from above. A raptoran  ghter gives

up some of her versatility and defensive prowess, but gains

signi cant airborne advantages.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a raptoran  ghter substitution level, a character must be

a raptoran about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of  ghter.

at 19th level).

This ability doesnt give the hal ing rogue the ability to

deal sneak attack damage to creatures she otherwise couldnt

affect (whether due to their anatomy, concealment, range, or

any other reason).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace,

the standard rogues sneak attack ability.

Thiefs Luck (Ex): At 3rd level, a hal ing rogue gains a

second chance against certain dangers. She can reroll any

Re ex save she has just rolled. If she chooses to use this abil-

ity (which must be decided before the result of the original

cant use this ability more than once per round.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  rogues

ability of trap sense. A hal ing rogue with this substitution

feature never gains trap sense from rogue levels.

Sniping Mastery (Ex): A hal ing rogue who has hidden

at least 10 feet away from her target can make one or more

ranged  attacks,  then  immediately  hide  again  as  a  free

action. She takes only a 10 penalty on her Hide check

to do so (rather than the normal 20; see page 76 of the

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  rogues

special ability gained at 10th level.

To  take  a  raptoran  cleric  substitution  level,  a  character

must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 7th level

of cleric. A raptoran cleric must have selected either the

Air domain (see page 185 of the Players Handbook) or the

Sky domain (see page 174 of this book) to select a raptoran

cleric substitution level.

Class Skills

Raptoran cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills

as the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er (or four times

this number as a beginning character).

Class Features

All the following are features of the raptoran clerics racial

substitution levels.

Air Mastery (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, airborne crea-

tures take a 1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a

raptoran cleric.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  clerics

heavy armor pro ciency gained at 1st level.

Empathy of the Winds (Ex): A 1st-level raptoran cleric

gains a strong bond with air and its denizens. He learns

Auran as a bonus language (in addition to the languages

available to him because of his race and the Speak Language

skill).  He  gains  a  +4  circumstance  bonus  on  Diplomacy

checks made to interact with natives of the Elemental Plane

Air Summoning Talent (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a

raptoran cleric can summon certain creatures of air more

easily than other clerics can. Add the following monsters

to the list of creatures that the cleric can summon with the

appropriate summon monster spell:

Summon monster II: Small air elemental

160

Raptoran cleric

Raptoran  ghter

Raptoran sorcerer

Summon monster V: Large air elemental

would only have the earth descriptor due to a particular

version of the spell (such as a summon monster spell used

to summon an earth elemental), the spell remains on the

clerics spell list but the version with the earth descriptor

Open the Wind-Gate (Ex): A 7th-level raptoran cleric can

Large air elemental with lesser planar ally, a single 16 HD Huge

gains ight after undertaking her Walk of the Four Winds,

she can y while carrying a medium load.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  ghters

ability to use superior positioning to deal extra damage in melee.

Whenever the raptoran is ying and higher than her opponent,

she gains a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  ghters

Fast Flight (Ex): An 8th-level raptoran ghters glide and

y speeds are 10 feet faster than the norm for her race. Fast

ight is considered a racial bonus to speed, so it stacks with

enhancement bonuses from spells and magic items.

This  substitution  feature  replaces  the  standard  ghters

RAPTORAN SORCERER

The raptoran sorcerer has an almost instinctive command of

the magical forces required to manipulate the air beneath his

wings. He loses some versatility in spellcasting but gains the

ability to cast additional air-based spells and even the service

of an elemental familiar.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take a raptoran sorcerer substitution level, a character

must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 5th, or 11th level

of sorcerer.

All the following are features of the raptoran sorcerers racial

substitution levels.

Air Magic: The following spells are considered to be on a

raptoran sorcerers class spell list (and thus may be selected

as known spells at the appropriate levels):

4th level: air walk

5th level: control winds

7th level: wind walk

8th level: whirlwind

A raptoran sorcerer gains this class feature if he selects any

of the indicated raptoran sorcerer substitution levels (1st, 5th,

or 11th).

Elemental Familiar (Ex): A 1st-level raptoran sorcerer

can obtain a Small air elemental as a familiar. The elementals

hit points are equal to its normal hit points or one half its

masters  hit  points,  whichever  are  greater.  The  elemental

familiar  does  not  gain  the  ability  to  speak  with  animals.

This familiar otherwise functions identically to the standard

sorcerers familiar ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerers

familiar ability gained at 1st level.

Command the Winds: A 5th-level raptoran sorcerer adds

gust of wind, whispering wind, and wind wall to his list of spells

known. Wind wall is henceforth treated as a 2nd-level spell

for the raptoran sorcerer.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerers

ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell at 5th level. From this

point on, the raptoran sorcerers number of 2nd-level spells

known (not including the gust of wind, whispering wind, and

wind wall spells) is one less than the value shown on Table

317, page 54 of the Players Handbook.

Spell on the Wing (Ex): When airborne and casting a spell

with a casting time of 1 standard action or less, a raptoran

sorcerer of 11th level or higher can move both before and

after spellcasting, provided that his total distance moved is

not greater than his speed.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerers

ability to learn a new 5th-level spell at 11th level. From this

point on, the raptoran sorcerers number of 5th-level spells

known is one less than the value shown on Table 317, page

54 of the Players Handbook.

lves, raptorans, and halings have developed a

variety of specialized pieces of equipment that

suit their tastes, lifestyles, and favored tactics.

Elves are renowned for both their magical

prowess and their skill with delicate but lasting

work, especially with organic materials. Elven work, like the

elves themselves, proves light, supple, and deceptively strong.

Elves are also famous as especially meticulous and careful

craftworkers,  and  their  unhurried  approach  to  crafting

produces exquisite results. Just about anything elven-made

has a subtle beauty; to an elf, an items esthetic appeal is as

important as its utility.

Of  all  the  races  of  the  wild,  elves  are  credited  with  the

most extensive list of new inventions and specialized gear.

Scholars  (and  many  elves)  attribute  this  to  the  elves  long

cultural history and penchant for working at problems until

theyre solved. Less charitable observers suggest that elves

simply manage to get the credit for anything that seems even

slightly out of the ordinary.

Like elves, raptorans produce light and strong items. For

raptorans, light construction is a necessity because of their

limited  ability  to  get  aloft  when  carrying  any  appreciable

amount  of  weight.  Raptorans  are  most  concerned  with

utility and functionality, at least where everyday items are

concerned. Above all, raptorans prefer items made to last,

and they abhor shoddy work.

Several  raptoran  inventions,  such  as  the  cargo  kite,

meet needs that arise from the raptorans aerial culture.

Such items dont often prove useful to other folk, except

as curiosities, though adventurers with access to magical

ight might nd them exceptionally useful.

Like  the  raptorans,  haling  crafters  concentrate  on

utility. Halings actually prefer items that look ordinary.

Given the races wandering lifestyle, almost anything a

haling owns winds up covered with dust and grime

from the road most of the time, and items that seem too

nely wrought simply draw too much attention to their

owners. As a consequence, many haling innovations are

overlooked or attributed to the elves or other peoples.

WEAPONS

The elven taste for archery and swordplay has led the

elves to create several kinds of bows and swords per-

fectly adapted for their tastes. Raptorans and halings,

too, have devised weapons to suit themselves. Table

71 provides the particulars for the nonmagical

weapons described below.

Arrow, Blunt: These projectiles have blunt tips

wrapped in leather instead of pointed arrowheads. They

have a shorter range increment than normal arrows

and deal nonlethal damage.

163

Arrow, Dragonsbreath: A dragonsbreath arrow has a

shaft soaked in resin or pitch and a slightly enlarged head

 lled with a dab of alchemists  re. Slots in the head force

air into the chamber when the arrow is  red, igniting the

alchemists  re and the shaft as well. The slots in the head

emit  a  low  screech  as  the  arrow   ies  through  the  air.  A

dragonsbreath arrow deals an extra 1 point of  re damage

when it hits a target, and that target must make a DC 15

Re ex save or catch on  re. A dragonsbreath arrow cant

be reused on a miss.

Arrow, Serpentstongue: Arrows arent very useful for

attacking objects, so the elves developed the serpentstongue

arrow, which has a forked point with sharp edges on the tips

and inside the prongs. A skilled archer can neatly sever a rope

or leather strap with a serpentstongue arrow.

A serpentstongue arrow deals both piercing and slashing

damage, and it deals full damage (rather than the usual half

damage) to objects with a hardness of 5 or less.

Arrow, Swiftwing: These arrows are made slightly longer

than normal with a small, aerodynamic head and enlarged

 etching (the feathers added to the shaft) for extra stability

and accuracy on long shots. A swiftwing arrow incurs only

half the usual penalty for attacking at range (1 per range

increment rather than the usual 2).

Foot Spike: The raptorans developed this exotic weapon

for use in aerial combat. A foot spike resembles a sharp knife

blade strapped to the bottom of a sturdy boot. The spike is

spring-loaded and folds into the boot for walking, and thus

has no effect on movement. When a foot spike is unfolded,

the wearers land speed is reduced to 5 feet, and he cant make

a 5-foot step (see page 304 of the Players Handbook). Extending

or retracting a foot spike is a move action, the equivalent of

drawing or stowing a weapon.

Foot spikes are primarily intended for use by airborne

combatants. A character who uses a foot spike while on the

ground takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls.

A character wearing a pair of foot spikes can attack with

both as if wielding two light weapons. A character cant use

a single foot spike as part of a two-weapon attack.

When a character pro cient with foot spikes makes a dive

attack (see page 68) while wearing a pair of foot spikes, he

can attack with both foot spikes at the end of the charge.

Footbow:  This  exotic  weapon  resembles  a  composite

long bow but is designed to be used in  ight, with the archer

holding the bow in her feet and drawing it with one or both

hands. Like a composite longbow (see page 119 of the Players

Handbook), all footbows  are made with a particular strength

rating. If a characters Strength bonus is less than the strength

rating of the footbow, she cant effectively use it, so she takes

a 2 penalty on attacks with it. The default footbow requires

a Strength bonus of +0 or higher to use with pro ciency.

A footbow can be made with a high strength rating just as a

composite longbow can; each point of Strength bonus granted

by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.

1 Weight figures are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much, and a Large weapon weighs twice as much.

2 When two types are given, the weapon is both types if the entry specifies and, or either type (players choice at time of

attack) if the entry specifies or.

3 The weapon deals nonlethal damage rather than lethal damage.

4 Double weapon.

The wielder of a footbow can choose to use both hands to

draw it back; in this case she may add 1-1/2 her Strength bonus

to damage (up to a maximum of 1-1/2 the strength rating of the

bow), as long as she is strong enough to use it without penalty.

A footbow can be used on the ground, but the archer must

be prone to do so and takes a 4 penalty on the attack roll.

For raptorans, the footbow is a martial weapon rather than

an exotic weapon.

Lynxpaw: A lynxpaw is a double weapon, consisting of a

length of  nely wrought steel chain with a blade similar to a

rapier at one end and a spiked weight at the other. A character

can  ght with it as if  ghting with two weapons, but if he

does, he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated

with  ghting with two weapons, as if using a one-handed

weapon and a light weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page

160 of the Players Handbook). The lynxpaws rapier end is a

piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (1820/2).

The lynxpaws spiked weight end, which resembles a feline

paw with the claws extended (hence the name), is a slashing

weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (20/3). A character

can use either end as the primary weapon; the other end

becomes the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a lynxpaw

in only one hand cant use it as a double weapon and can only

use one end of the weapon in any given round.

A pro cient character can make trip attacks with a lynx-

paws chain. If he is tripped during his own trip attempt, he

can drop the lynxpaw to avoid being tripped.

When using the lynxpaws chain, the character gets a +2

bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent

(including the roll to avoid being disarmed himself if such

an attempt fails).

A character can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply

his Dexterity modi er instead of his Strength modi er to

attack  rolls  with  a  lynxpaw  sized  for  him,  even  though  it

isnt a light weapon.

Skiprock: Hal ing weaponsmiths developed these pol-

ished stones. Each skiprock is perfectly weighted and shaped

for throwing. If the skiprock hits its target, it ricochets toward

165

Arrow, Dragonsbreath: A dragonsbreath arrow has a

shaft soaked in resin or pitch and a slightly enlarged head

 lled with a dab of alchemists  re. Slots in the head force

air into the chamber when the arrow is  red, igniting the

alchemists  re and the shaft as well. The slots in the head

emit  a  low  screech  as  the  arrow   ies  through  the  air.  A

dragonsbreath arrow deals an extra 1 point of  re damage

when it hits a target, and that target must make a DC 15

Re ex save or catch on  re. A dragonsbreath arrow cant

be reused on a miss.

Arrow, Serpentstongue: Arrows arent very useful for

attacking objects, so the elves developed the serpentstongue

arrow, which has a forked point with sharp edges on the tips

and inside the prongs. A skilled archer can neatly sever a rope

or leather strap with a serpentstongue arrow.

A serpentstongue arrow deals both piercing and slashing

damage, and it deals full damage (rather than the usual half

than normal with a small, aerodynamic head and enlarged

 etching (the feathers added to the shaft) for extra stability

and accuracy on long shots. A swiftwing arrow incurs only

half the usual penalty for attacking at range (1 per range

increment rather than the usual 2).

Foot Spike: The raptorans developed this exotic weapon

for use in aerial combat. A foot spike resembles a sharp knife

blade strapped to the bottom of a sturdy boot. The spike is

spring-loaded and folds into the boot for walking, and thus

has no effect on movement. When a foot spike is unfolded,

the wearers land speed is reduced to 5 feet, and he cant make

a 5-foot step (see page 304 of the Players Handbook). Extending

or retracting a foot spike is a move action, the equivalent of

drawing or stowing a weapon.

Foot spikes are primarily intended for use by airborne

combatants. A character who uses a foot spike while on the

ground takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls.

A character wearing a pair of foot spikes can attack with

both as if wielding two light weapons. A character cant use

a single foot spike as part of a two-weapon attack.

When a character pro cient with foot spikes makes a dive

attack (see page 68) while wearing a pair of foot spikes, he

can attack with both foot spikes at the end of the charge.

Footbow:  This  exotic  weapon  resembles  a  composite

long bow but is designed to be used in  ight, with the archer

holding the bow in her feet and drawing it with one or both

hands. Like a composite longbow (see page 119 of the Players

rating of the footbow, she cant effectively use it, so she takes

a 2 penalty on attacks with it. The default footbow requires

a Strength bonus of +0 or higher to use with pro ciency.

A footbow can be made with a high strength rating just as a

composite longbow can; each point of Strength bonus granted

by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.

For raptorans, the footbow is a martial weapon rather than

an exotic weapon.

Lynxpaw: A lynxpaw is a double weapon, consisting of a

length of  nely wrought steel chain with a blade similar to a

rapier at one end and a spiked weight at the other. A character

can  ght with it as if  ghting with two weapons, but if he

does, he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated

with  ghting with two weapons, as if using a one-handed

weapon and a light weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page

160 of the Players Handbook). The lynxpaws rapier end is a

piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (1820/2).

The lynxpaws spiked weight end, which resembles a feline

paw with the claws extended (hence the name), is a slashing

weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (20/3). A character

can use either end as the primary weapon; the other end

becomes the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a lynxpaw

in only one hand cant use it as a double weapon and can only

use one end of the weapon in any given round.

A pro cient character can make trip attacks with a lynx-

paws chain. If he is tripped during his own trip attempt, he

can drop the lynxpaw to avoid being tripped.

When using the lynxpaws chain, the character gets a +2

bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent

(including the roll to avoid being disarmed himself if such

an attempt fails).

A character can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply

his Dexterity modi er instead of his Strength modi er to

attack  rolls  with  a  lynxpaw  sized  for  him,  even  though  it

isnt a light weapon.

Skiprock: Hal ing weaponsmiths developed these pol-

ished stones. Each skiprock is perfectly weighted and shaped

for throwing. If the skiprock hits its target, it ricochets toward

165

another target of the throwers choice. The second target must

be adjacent to the original target (no more than 5 feet away).

The thrower immediately makes a second attack roll for the

skiprock against the new target, with an attack bonus 2 lower

than that of the initial attack.

Although they are thrown weapons, skiprocks are treated

as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting

masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what

happens to them after they are thrown.

Skiprocks can be used as sling bullets, but using a skiprocks

ricochet ability in conjunction with a sling requires taking

the Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (war sling) feat.

Sword, Elven Courtblade: These exotic swords seem

impossibly long and thin, tapering to a needlelike point.

One edge of the blade is sharpened along its entire length,

and the opposite edge is sharpened only for the  nal quarter

near the tip. A courtblade has a basket-shaped hilt (usually

made to resemble leaves and vines), a long grip, and a heavy

pommel. The weapon is intended for thrusting attacks, but

the wielder can slash with it as well.

A character with the Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (elven court-

blade) feat  nds the weapon well suited for quick feints and

thrusts. A character can use an elven courtblade in conjunction

with the Weapon Finesse feat, applying her Dexterity bonus

(if any) to melee attacks she makes with the weapon, though

it remains a two-handed weapon and not a light weapon.

Characters pro cient with the elven courtblade may treat it as

a greatsword for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater

Weapon  Focus,  Greater  Weapon  Specialization,  Improved

Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.

Sword, Elven Lightblade: This rapierlike exotic weapon is

the size of a short sword but weighs only as much as a dagger.

Dexterous elf  ghters and rogues favor it. Its thin,  exible

blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs

of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightbladeoften decorated

with intricate  ligree and tiny gemstonesas a sign of their

station, even if they arent pro cient in its use.

Characters proficient with the elven lightblade may treat

it as a rapier or a short sword for the purpose of any of the

following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon

Specialization,  Improved  Critical,  Weapon  Focus,  and

Weapon Specialization.

Sword, Elven Thinblade: This rapierlike exotic weapon is

the size of a longsword but much lighter. Like the lightblade,

it is favored by dexterous elf  ghters and rogues.

A character can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply his

Dexterity modi er instead of his Strength modi er to attack

rolls with an elven thinblade.

Characters proficient with the elven thinblade may treat

it as a rapier or a longsword for the purpose of any of the

following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon

Specialization,  Improved  Critical,  Weapon  Focus,  and

Weapon Specialization.

War Sling: This exotic weapon is a heavy sling used with

a special sidearm throw to hurl a skiprock (see above) with

deadly power. Without skiprock ammunition, a war sling is

treated as a normal sling and deals the appropriate damage

when used to throw normal sling bullets or stones.

A user pro cient with both the skiprock and the war sling

can ricochet a sling-thrown skiprock just like a hand-thrown

skiprock; see the skiprock description, above.

WEAPON MODIFICATIONS

Bow, Elvencraft: One of the biggest problems facing any

archer is deciding what to do when a foe gets within melee

reach. Does one stand fast and take the consequences (which

can prove painful if not deadly), fall back (not always practi-

cal), or drop the bow and draw a melee weapon (inconvenient

at best). Elf bowyers have made the choice somewhat less

dif cult by crafting bows that can stand up to melee combat.

Thanks to elven ingenuity, these weapons work just as well

as melee weapons as they do as ranged weapons.

An elvencraft bow is thicker and heavier than a normal

bow.  An  elvencraft  shortbow  functions  as  a  club  when

wielded as a melee weapon. An elvencraft longbow functions

as a quarterstaff when wielded as a melee weapon. The wielder

incurs no penalty on attack rolls when using an elvencraft

bow as a melee weapon.

A character wielding an elvencraft bow can freely interchange

melee and ranged attacks during the same round. When wield-

ing an elvencraft bow, the user threatens the squares around

him no matter how he last used the weapon.

Magical enhancements to an elvencraft bow only affect its

use as a bow. Enhancements to the melee capabilities of the

weapon must be added separately.

An elvencraft bow costs 300 gp more than a normal bow.

Blade,  Close  Fighting:  Elves  love  swordplay,  but  even

elves recognize that a sword isnt always an ideal weapon.

They developed the close  ghting blade for times when they

must  ght in spaces too constricted for true swordplay.

A close  ghting blade is simply a knifelike blade concealed

within  the  hilt  or  haft  of  a  one-handed  or  larger  melee

weapon. Pressing a catch in the hilt (a free action) releases

the spring-loaded blade, which extends and locks into place

protruding from the pommel or butt of the larger weapon.

A  close   ghting  blade  is  the  equivalent  of  a  dagger  in

all respects, except that it is a bit more awkward to use. It

is most useful in situations where the wielder is suddenly

rendered  incapable  of  using  her  normal  melee  weapon,

such as when she is grappling or being swallowed by some

hulking monster.

While a close  ghting blade is extended, the wielder takes

a 2 penalty on attack rolls, both with the close  ghting blade

and with the weapon that normally conceals it (which becomes

more awkward to use). Retracting a close  ghting blade is the

equivalent of sheathing a weapon (a move action).

Even with the hidden blade extended, a weapon with a

close  ghting blade is not a double weapon. The user can

employ either the main weapon or the extended blade, but

not both in the same round.

A close  ghting blade must be enchanted separately from

the weapon in which it is housed.

Elves typically include close  ghting blades in longswords

or  rapiers  for  their  own  use.  Elf  wizards  sometimes  carry

quarterstaffs that contain close  ghting blades. In some areas,

elves fashion battleaxes, heavy maces, or similar one-handed

weapons with close  ghting blades, though these items are

usually sold to other races.

Adding a close  ghting blade to an existing weapon, or

including one as part of a new weapon, costs 100 gp.

ARMOR

Elves are famous for lightweight armor that provides good protec-

tion and considerable freedom of movement. Unlike dwarves,

who typically innovate in armorcrafting by inventing new

exotic types of armor, elves learn to use the materials available to

themoften augmenting them through alchemy or the simple

application of skillto create extraordinarily supple and  exible

suits of armor. Indeed, the armor popularly called elven chain is

nothing but a regular suit of chainmail made from mithral.

Over the years, these inventions have spread to hal ing and

raptoran armorsmiths, whose customers typically have similar

needs regarding a suit of armors weight and encumbrance.

Each suit of armor described on Table 72 represents an

existing kind of armor from the Players Handbook with a

special material used in its creation. These special materials

are detailed later in this chapter (except for mithral, which is

described on page 284 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

ARMOR MODIFICATIONS

In addition to their innovations with special armor materials,

the races of the wild have also created armor modi cations

tailored to their needs.

Forestwarden Shroud: Elves invented this lightweight

set of tunic and leggings, though it was quickly adopted by

rangers and similar characters of all races.

A forestwarden shroud is worn over a suit of armor. It can

be incorporated into any suit of armor during creation, or it

can be added later. Its slick surface allows branches and leaves

to slide easily across it, negating the effect that undergrowth

and heavy undergrowth has on the wearers Tumble and Move

Silently checks (see Forest Terrain, page 87 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

A forestwarden shroud costs 100 gp and adds 2 pounds to

the weight of a suit of armor.

Netcutter Spikes: The raptorans developed netcutter

spikes to help them avoid becoming immobilized in combat.

Netcutter spikes are slightly longer than regular armor spikes

and have X-shaped cross-sections. Each spike is sharpened

along all four edges.

Netcutter spikes function just like armor spikes (see

page 124 of the Players Handbook). In addition, a character

pro cient with the armor worn gains a +4 circumstance bonus

on Strength checks or Escape Artist checks made to escape

from a net, a web spell, or a similar entangling effect.

another target of the throwers choice. The second target must

be adjacent to the original target (no more than 5 feet away).

The thrower immediately makes a second attack roll for the

skiprock against the new target, with an attack bonus 2 lower

than that of the initial attack.

Although they are thrown weapons, skiprocks are treated

as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting

masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what

happens to them after they are thrown.

Skiprocks can be used as sling bullets, but using a skiprocks

ricochet ability in conjunction with a sling requires taking

the Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (war sling) feat.

Sword, Elven Courtblade: These exotic swords seem

impossibly long and thin, tapering to a needlelike point.

One edge of the blade is sharpened along its entire length,

and the opposite edge is sharpened only for the  nal quarter

near the tip. A courtblade has a basket-shaped hilt (usually

made to resemble leaves and vines), a long grip, and a heavy

pommel. The weapon is intended for thrusting attacks, but

the wielder can slash with it as well.

A character with the Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (elven court-

blade) feat  nds the weapon well suited for quick feints and

thrusts. A character can use an elven courtblade in conjunction

with the Weapon Finesse feat, applying her Dexterity bonus

(if any) to melee attacks she makes with the weapon, though

it remains a two-handed weapon and not a light weapon.

Characters pro cient with the elven courtblade may treat it as

a greatsword for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater

Weapon  Focus,  Greater  Weapon  Specialization,  Improved

Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.

Sword, Elven Lightblade: This rapierlike exotic weapon is

the size of a short sword but weighs only as much as a dagger.

Dexterous elf  ghters and rogues favor it. Its thin,  exible

blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs

of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightbladeoften decorated

with intricate  ligree and tiny gemstonesas a sign of their

station, even if they arent pro cient in its use.

Characters proficient with the elven lightblade may treat

it as a rapier or a short sword for the purpose of any of the

following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon

Specialization,  Improved  Critical,  Weapon  Focus,  and

Weapon Specialization.

Sword, Elven Thinblade: This rapierlike exotic weapon is

the size of a longsword but much lighter. Like the lightblade,

it is favored by dexterous elf  ghters and rogues.

A character can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply his

Dexterity modi er instead of his Strength modi er to attack

rolls with an elven thinblade.

Characters proficient with the elven thinblade may treat

it as a rapier or a longsword for the purpose of any of the

following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon

Specialization,  Improved  Critical,  Weapon  Focus,  and

Weapon Specialization.

War Sling: This exotic weapon is a heavy sling used with

a special sidearm throw to hurl a skiprock (see above) with

deadly power. Without skiprock ammunition, a war sling is

treated as a normal sling and deals the appropriate damage

when used to throw normal sling bullets or stones.

A user pro cient with both the skiprock and the war sling

can ricochet a sling-thrown skiprock just like a hand-thrown

skiprock; see the skiprock description, above.

WEAPON MODIFICATIONS

Bow, Elvencraft: One of the biggest problems facing any

archer is deciding what to do when a foe gets within melee

reach. Does one stand fast and take the consequences (which

can prove painful if not deadly), fall back (not always practi-

cal), or drop the bow and draw a melee weapon (inconvenient

at best). Elf bowyers have made the choice somewhat less

dif cult by crafting bows that can stand up to melee combat.

Thanks to elven ingenuity, these weapons work just as well

as melee weapons as they do as ranged weapons.

An elvencraft bow is thicker and heavier than a normal

bow.  An  elvencraft  shortbow  functions  as  a  club  when

wielded as a melee weapon. An elvencraft longbow functions

as a quarterstaff when wielded as a melee weapon. The wielder

incurs no penalty on attack rolls when using an elvencraft

bow as a melee weapon.

A character wielding an elvencraft bow can freely interchange

melee and ranged attacks during the same round. When wield-

ing an elvencraft bow, the user threatens the squares around

him no matter how he last used the weapon.

Magical enhancements to an elvencraft bow only affect its

use as a bow. Enhancements to the melee capabilities of the

weapon must be added separately.

An elvencraft bow costs 300 gp more than a normal bow.

Blade,  Close  Fighting:  Elves  love  swordplay,  but  even

elves recognize that a sword isnt always an ideal weapon.

They developed the close  ghting blade for times when they

must  ght in spaces too constricted for true swordplay.

A close  ghting blade is simply a knifelike blade concealed

within  the  hilt  or  haft  of  a  one-handed  or  larger  melee

weapon. Pressing a catch in the hilt (a free action) releases

the spring-loaded blade, which extends and locks into place

protruding from the pommel or butt of the larger weapon.

A  close   ghting  blade  is  the  equivalent  of  a  dagger  in

all respects, except that it is a bit more awkward to use. It

is most useful in situations where the wielder is suddenly

rendered  incapable  of  using  her  normal  melee  weapon,

such as when she is grappling or being swallowed by some

hulking monster.

While a close  ghting blade is extended, the wielder takes

a 2 penalty on attack rolls, both with the close  ghting blade

and with the weapon that normally conceals it (which becomes

more awkward to use). Retracting a close  ghting blade is the

equivalent of sheathing a weapon (a move action).

Even with the hidden blade extended, a weapon with a

close  ghting blade is not a double weapon. The user can

employ either the main weapon or the extended blade, but

not both in the same round.

A close  ghting blade must be enchanted separately from

the weapon in which it is housed.

Elves typically include close  ghting blades in longswords

or  rapiers  for  their  own  use.  Elf  wizards  sometimes  carry

quarterstaffs that contain close  ghting blades. In some areas,

elves fashion battleaxes, heavy maces, or similar one-handed

weapons with close  ghting blades, though these items are

usually sold to other races.

Adding a close  ghting blade to an existing weapon, or

including one as part of a new weapon, costs 100 gp.

ARMOR

Elves are famous for lightweight armor that provides good protec-

tion and considerable freedom of movement. Unlike dwarves,

who typically innovate in armorcrafting by inventing new

exotic types of armor, elves learn to use the materials available to

themoften augmenting them through alchemy or the simple

application of skillto create extraordinarily supple and  exible

suits of armor. Indeed, the armor popularly called elven chain is

nothing but a regular suit of chainmail made from mithral.

Over the years, these inventions have spread to hal ing and

raptoran armorsmiths, whose customers typically have similar

needs regarding a suit of armors weight and encumbrance.

Each suit of armor described on Table 72 represents an

are detailed later in this chapter (except for mithral, which is

1 Weight figures are for armor sized to fit Medium characters. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and

armor fitted for Large characters weighs twice as much.

2 When running in heavy armor, you move only triple your speed, not quadruple.

Netcutter  spikes  cost  200  gp  and  add  10  pounds  to  the

weight of a suit of armor.

Thistledown  Suit:  Long  used  in  the  creation  of  light-

weight padded armor by elven crafters, the silken fabric

known as thistledown (see Special Armor Materials, below)

has recently been used in other armors as well by inventive

haling armorsmiths.

Any armor that normally incorporates an underlying

layer of quilted fabric (including chain shirts, as well as

any medium or heavy armor normally made of metal) can

substitute a thistledown suit for the normal layer of fabric.

This alteration increases the armors armor check penalty

by 1 (because of the added bulk) but reduces its arcane spell

failure chance by 5% (because the quilted thistledown makes

the armor less restrictive for somatic gestures).

A thistledown suit requires a DC 15 Craft (tailoring) check

to create and costs 250 gp. It adds no weight to a suit of armor.

SPECIAL ARMOR MATERIALS

Generations  of  tinkering  and  experimentation,  mostly  by

the elves, have produced a variety of materials with special

qualities  suited  to  life  in  the  wild.  Three  of  these  special

materials are described below.

Leafweave:  As  the  name  suggests,  leafweave  armor  is

made from forest leaves, which are then treated with a special

alchemical process that makes them as tough and exible as

leather, with considerably less weight and encumbrance.

The arcane spell failure chance for leafweave armor is reduced

by 5% compared to ordinary armor of the same sort, due to its

increased exibility. The armors maximum Dexterity bonus is

increased by +1, and its armor check penalty (if any) is lessened

by 2. Leafweave versions of padded, leather, studded leather,

and hide armor exist; leafweave studded leather typically

incorporates darkwood studs to make it druid-friendly.

Creating leafweave armor requires a single successful DC

25  Craft  (alchemy)  check  in  addition  to  the  normal  Craft

(armorsmithing) checks.

Leafweave armor costs 740 gp more than ordinary armor

of the same sort. It has hardness 2 and 5 hit points per inch

of thickness.

Thistledown: This lightweight fabric gets its name from

its soft feel and dove-gray color. Elves have made padded

armor from this material for centuries, and it is well liked

by arcane spellcasters.

Thistledown padded armor weighs only half as much as

normal padded armor. It grants its wearer a +2 circumstance

bonus  on  Hide  checks  in  areas  of  darkness  or  shadowy

illumination, as it blends in with the dim background. It is

treated as masterwork armor (the masterwork cost is included

in the armors given cost).

Thistledown has 2 hit points per inch of thickness and

hardness 0.

Wildwood: The rare saelas tree (saelas is an Elven word that

translates as wildwood in Common) produces wood with a

peculiar set of qualities. Not only is it extraordinarily exible

for days after harvesting, but items crafted of wildwood regrow

after being damaged. At the hands of an armorsmith also

skilled in woodworking, wildwood can be crafted into light-

weight armor nearly as strong as steel. It is prized by druids,

who can wear it without sacricing their class abilities.

Wildwood armor provides 1 less point of armor bonus than

ordinary armor of the same sort. However, the armors maxi-

mum Dex bonus increases by 1, its armor check penalty is

reduced by 1 (minimum 0), and its arcane spell failure chance

is reduced by 5%. In addition, the wearer of a suit of wildwood

armor can ignore its armor check penalty on Hide checks

made in areas of undergrowth or heavy undergrowth.

Armor made from wildwood weighs three-quarters as

much as the same item made from metal. Armor not primarily

made of metal is not meaningfully affected by being partially

made from wildwood.

As long as it is exposed to sunlight for at least 1 hour per

day, a suit of wildwood armor naturally heals 1 point of

damage every 24 hours. If it is left to soak in at least one

gallon of water while exposed to sunlight for 8 hours, it heals

5 points of damage.

Armor made from wildwood is always of masterwork quality

(the masterwork cost is included in the armors given cost).

Wildwood armor costs double what ordinary masterwork

armor of the same sort costs, but it takes no longer to make than

masterwork armor of that sort. For each Craft (armorsmith-

ing) check required to create a suit of wildwood armor, a Craft

(woodworking) check against the same DC is also required

(though the same character need not make both checks).

Wildwood  has  10  hit  points  per  inch  of  thickness  and

hardness 6.

GEAR

Most mundane items that elves, raptorans, and halings use

passed into common use by all peoples long ago. Still, there

are a few items only they make well or fully appreciate.

Carry Net: This sturdy net has a looser weave than a sh-

net. Raptorans use them to haul goods from raptoran villages

to trading markets. The net is about 5 feet square and has a

20-foot-long hemp cord dangling from each end. The cords

allow two raptorans to share the nets load. The net can hold

100 pounds of material.

Cargo Kite: Actually something like a glider, a cargo kite

can lift up 250 pounds when towed forward. The cargo is

slung in a basket or net under the kite. A collection of ve

or so 30-foot-long hemp cords allows one or more creatures

to tow the kite. The kite itself is as big as a Large creature

(10-foot space).

To tow a loaded kite through the air, a creature (or several

creatures) must be able to drag the weight of the kite and its

cargo.  Material  carried  in  the  kite  doesnt  count  as  weight

the towing creatures carry, but the towing creatures move at

encumbered speed (see page 162 of the Players Handbook and

page 20 of the Dungeon Masters Guide) unless they are capable

of dragging at least twice the weight of the kite and its cargo.

A  towed  kite  has  poor  maneuverability  and  a  minimum

forward speed of 40 feet. If it does not maintain its minimum

forward speed, the kite descends at the rate of 60 feet a round.

A strong wind (see page 95 of the Dungeon Masters Guide)

can lift a loaded kite, provided someone stays on the ground

to steady it.

Elven  Harp:  Musicians  from  all  cultures  prize  these

masterwork instruments for their clear, dulcet tones. Bards

covet them. They produce a purity of sound unheard of in

any  non-elven  crafted  instrument.  Like  any  masterwork

instrument, an elven harp grants a +2 circumstance bonus

on Perform checks made with it. The instrument is so ne,

however,  that  a  truly  skilled  musician  can  work  wonders

with it. Characters with at least 5 ranks in Perform (string

instruments) gain an extra +1 circumstance bonus on Perform

checks made with the harp (for a total bonus of +3).

Not only does an elven harp produce music unrivaled by

any other mortal instrument, it is a beauty to behold. Because

its beauty relies on a particular intricate design, it is more dif-

cult to craft than other masterwork instruments, requiring

extra care and taking twice as long. When checking the item

makers weekly or daily progress in crafting the item, multiply

the check result by one-half the items DC to determine the

value of the crafters work.

The elven harp comes in several different sizes. A hand harp

is only about 6 inches tall and 8 inches wide. It has a high

pitch, thanks to its fairly short strings, but sounds sweet just

the same. The harps base includes a handle so the musician

can hold it rmly while plucking the strings.

A lap harp is about 2 feet high and 3 feet wide. The musi-

cian usually places the harp on a table or sits and holds it in

her lap. Its possible to play a lap harp standing up, but the

musician takes a 1 penalty on her Perform check (though

the circumstance bonuses from the harps quality and the

players skill still apply).

A great harp is a glorious instrument, nearly 6 feet high

and just as wide. The musician usually sits in a chair or on a

stool to play it.

Honey Leather: Honey leather is a light canvas used as

protection against rain and dampness. It gets its name from

its golden color and its texture, which resembles soft, cured

leather. Elves, raptorans, and halings use honey leather for

tents and to protect camping gear. It snags and tears easily, so

honey leather isnt much good outside camp. It is, however,

waterproof thanks to the alchemical treatment that gives it

its color and texture.

A character equipped with a honey leather tarpaulin big

enough  to  drape  over  his  body  gains  a  +1  circumstance

bonus on Survival checks made to resist the effect of severe

weather. If the character is stationary, the bonus increases

to +2. A tarpaulin ranges in size from 3 feet square (for Small

1 Weight figures are for armor sized to fit Medium characters. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and

armor fitted for Large characters weighs twice as much.

2 When running in heavy armor, you move only triple your speed, not quadruple.

Netcutter  spikes  cost  200  gp  and  add  10  pounds  to  the

weight of a suit of armor.

Thistledown  Suit:  Long  used  in  the  creation  of  light-

weight padded armor by elven crafters, the silken fabric

known as thistledown (see Special Armor Materials, below)

has recently been used in other armors as well by inventive

haling armorsmiths.

Any armor that normally incorporates an underlying

layer of quilted fabric (including chain shirts, as well as

any medium or heavy armor normally made of metal) can

substitute a thistledown suit for the normal layer of fabric.

This alteration increases the armors armor check penalty

by 1 (because of the added bulk) but reduces its arcane spell

failure chance by 5% (because the quilted thistledown makes

the armor less restrictive for somatic gestures).

A thistledown suit requires a DC 15 Craft (tailoring) check

to create and costs 250 gp. It adds no weight to a suit of armor.

SPECIAL ARMOR MATERIALS

Generations  of  tinkering  and  experimentation,  mostly  by

the elves, have produced a variety of materials with special

qualities  suited  to  life  in  the  wild.  Three  of  these  special

materials are described below.

Leafweave:  As  the  name  suggests,  leafweave  armor  is

made from forest leaves, which are then treated with a special

alchemical process that makes them as tough and exible as

leather, with considerably less weight and encumbrance.

The arcane spell failure chance for leafweave armor is reduced

by 5% compared to ordinary armor of the same sort, due to its

increased exibility. The armors maximum Dexterity bonus is

increased by +1, and its armor check penalty (if any) is lessened

by 2. Leafweave versions of padded, leather, studded leather,

and hide armor exist; leafweave studded leather typically

incorporates darkwood studs to make it druid-friendly.

Creating leafweave armor requires a single successful DC

25  Craft  (alchemy)  check  in  addition  to  the  normal  Craft

(armorsmithing) checks.

Leafweave armor costs 740 gp more than ordinary armor

of the same sort. It has hardness 2 and 5 hit points per inch

of thickness.

Thistledown: This lightweight fabric gets its name from

its soft feel and dove-gray color. Elves have made padded

armor from this material for centuries, and it is well liked

by arcane spellcasters.

Thistledown padded armor weighs only half as much as

normal padded armor. It grants its wearer a +2 circumstance

bonus  on  Hide  checks  in  areas  of  darkness  or  shadowy

illumination, as it blends in with the dim background. It is

treated as masterwork armor (the masterwork cost is included

in the armors given cost).

Thistledown has 2 hit points per inch of thickness and

hardness 0.

Wildwood: The rare saelas tree (saelas is an Elven word that

translates as wildwood in Common) produces wood with a

peculiar set of qualities. Not only is it extraordinarily exible

for days after harvesting, but items crafted of wildwood regrow

after being damaged. At the hands of an armorsmith also

skilled in woodworking, wildwood can be crafted into light-

weight armor nearly as strong as steel. It is prized by druids,

who can wear it without sacricing their class abilities.

Wildwood armor provides 1 less point of armor bonus than

ordinary armor of the same sort. However, the armors maxi-

mum Dex bonus increases by 1, its armor check penalty is

reduced by 1 (minimum 0), and its arcane spell failure chance

is reduced by 5%. In addition, the wearer of a suit of wildwood

armor can ignore its armor check penalty on Hide checks

made in areas of undergrowth or heavy undergrowth.

Armor made from wildwood weighs three-quarters as

much as the same item made from metal. Armor not primarily

made of metal is not meaningfully affected by being partially

made from wildwood.

As long as it is exposed to sunlight for at least 1 hour per

day, a suit of wildwood armor naturally heals 1 point of

damage every 24 hours. If it is left to soak in at least one

gallon of water while exposed to sunlight for 8 hours, it heals

5 points of damage.

Armor made from wildwood is always of masterwork quality

(the masterwork cost is included in the armors given cost).

Wildwood armor costs double what ordinary masterwork

armor of the same sort costs, but it takes no longer to make than

masterwork armor of that sort. For each Craft (armorsmith-

ing) check required to create a suit of wildwood armor, a Craft

(woodworking) check against the same DC is also required

(though the same character need not make both checks).

Wildwood  has  10  hit  points  per  inch  of  thickness  and

hardness 6.

GEAR

Most mundane items that elves, raptorans, and halings use

passed into common use by all peoples long ago. Still, there

are a few items only they make well or fully appreciate.

Carry Net: This sturdy net has a looser weave than a sh-

net. Raptorans use them to haul goods from raptoran villages

to trading markets. The net is about 5 feet square and has a

20-foot-long hemp cord dangling from each end. The cords

allow two raptorans to share the nets load. The net can hold

100 pounds of material.

Cargo Kite: Actually something like a glider, a cargo kite

can lift up 250 pounds when towed forward. The cargo is

slung in a basket or net under the kite. A collection of ve

or so 30-foot-long hemp cords allows one or more creatures

to tow the kite. The kite itself is as big as a Large creature

(10-foot space).

To tow a loaded kite through the air, a creature (or several

creatures) must be able to drag the weight of the kite and its

cargo.  Material  carried  in  the  kite  doesnt  count  as  weight

the towing creatures carry, but the towing creatures move at

encumbered speed (see page 162 of the Players Handbook and

page 20 of the Dungeon Masters Guide) unless they are capable

of dragging at least twice the weight of the kite and its cargo.

A  towed  kite  has  poor  maneuverability  and  a  minimum

forward speed of 40 feet. If it does not maintain its minimum

forward speed, the kite descends at the rate of 60 feet a round.

A strong wind (see page 95 of the Dungeon Masters Guide)

can lift a loaded kite, provided someone stays on the ground

to steady it.

Elven  Harp:  Musicians  from  all  cultures  prize  these

masterwork instruments for their clear, dulcet tones. Bards

covet them. They produce a purity of sound unheard of in

any  non-elven  crafted  instrument.  Like  any  masterwork

instrument, an elven harp grants a +2 circumstance bonus

on Perform checks made with it. The instrument is so ne,

however,  that  a  truly  skilled  musician  can  work  wonders

with it. Characters with at least 5 ranks in Perform (string

instruments) gain an extra +1 circumstance bonus on Perform

checks made with the harp (for a total bonus of +3).

Not only does an elven harp produce music unrivaled by

any other mortal instrument, it is a beauty to behold. Because

its beauty relies on a particular intricate design, it is more dif-

cult to craft than other masterwork instruments, requiring

extra care and taking twice as long. When checking the item

makers weekly or daily progress in crafting the item, multiply

the check result by one-half the items DC to determine the

value of the crafters work.

The elven harp comes in several different sizes. A hand harp

is only about 6 inches tall and 8 inches wide. It has a high

pitch, thanks to its fairly short strings, but sounds sweet just

the same. The harps base includes a handle so the musician

can hold it rmly while plucking the strings.

A lap harp is about 2 feet high and 3 feet wide. The musi-

cian usually places the harp on a table or sits and holds it in

her lap. Its possible to play a lap harp standing up, but the

musician takes a 1 penalty on her Perform check (though

the circumstance bonuses from the harps quality and the

players skill still apply).

A great harp is a glorious instrument, nearly 6 feet high

and just as wide. The musician usually sits in a chair or on a

stool to play it.

Honey Leather: Honey leather is a light canvas used as

protection against rain and dampness. It gets its name from

its golden color and its texture, which resembles soft, cured

leather. Elves, raptorans, and halings use honey leather for

tents and to protect camping gear. It snags and tears easily, so

honey leather isnt much good outside camp. It is, however,

waterproof thanks to the alchemical treatment that gives it

its color and texture.

A character equipped with a honey leather tarpaulin big

enough  to  drape  over  his  body  gains  a  +1  circumstance

bonus on Survival checks made to resist the effect of severe

weather. If the character is stationary, the bonus increases

to +2. A tarpaulin ranges in size from 3 feet square (for Small

A carry net and a cargo kite trail behind two soaring raptorans

or Medium characters) to 6 feet square (for Medium or

Large characters).

A  tent  made  of  honey  leather  provides  a  +4  bonus  on

Survival checks for anyone inside. The cost of all such tents

include poles and stakes. A small pup tent (roomy enough

for one Small character to lie down with his gear) is 2 feet

wide by 4 feet long. A medium pup tent (roomy enough for

one Medium character and gear) is 3 feet by 7 feet. Pup tents

are as tall as they are wide. A square tent 10 feet wide is big

enough for a party of four Small or Medium characters. A

square tent 20 feet wide is big enough for a party of eight

Small or Medium characters or four Large characters. Square

tents are half as tall as they are wide.

Sashling: This broad, pleated cloth belt hides a great many

interior  pockets.  Ten  pockets  are  sewn  into  the  folds  of  a

sashling, each capable of holding an item weighing about a

quarter-pound. A sashlings pleats can conceal almost any-

thing that may be placed inside the belt: An object up to the

size of a hens egg leaves no visible bulge on the sashlings

exterior. A sashling is ideal for carrying small items such as

coins, gems, vials, material components, and pieces of jewelry

unobtrusively. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight

of Hand checks made to hide small objects on your body (see

Sleight of Hand, page 81 of the Players Handbook).

For  wearers  who  need  to  carry  more  supplies,  many

sashlings are made with hooks on the outer side. The wearer

can hang pouches and other items from the outside of the

sashling as well, just as with a normal belt.

MAGIC ITEMS

Elf wizards have created many kinds of magic items over the

years, many of them now in common use. Halfling and

raptoran spellcasters have made their contributions as well.

WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITIES

Elf, raptoran, and hal ing magic weapons emphasize speed,

stealth, and adaptability.

Blurstrike: On command (a free action), a weapon with

this special ability fades partially from view, appearing as

only a faint outline, though the wielder can see it normally.

When used in an attack, an activated blurstrike weapon (along

with its wielders hand and arm) appears as nothing but an

amorphous blur near the wielders body. The blurring effect

prevents a foe from knowing exactly where the blow is aimed.

The  rst attack made with a blurstrike weapon each round

is made as if the target were  at-footed. Foes that dont rely

on sight for combat (such as creatures with the blindsight

special quality) and creatures with the uncanny dodge class

feature retain their Dexterity bonus and dodge bonuses to

AC against the wielders attacks.

A blurstrike weapon can remain blurry for up to 10 rounds

a day. The duration of the effect need not be in consecutive

rounds; deactivating the effect is also a free action.

This property can be applied only to melee weapons.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, blur or invisibility; Price +2 bonus.

Hideaway:  The  races  of  the

wild  like  to  travel  light.  To

help  satisfy  this  desire,  elf

and  hal ing  wizards  have

developed  hideaway  weap-

ons,  which  can  made  to

fold  up  simply  by  pressing

a stud on a handle or haft.

Hideaway weapons are easy

to conceal when folded and

not  easily  recognizable  as

weapons, making them very

popular with rogues.

When folded, a hideaway

weapon collapses into a small

cylinder small enough to  t

comfortably in the wielders

hand. Pressing a second stud

unfolds  the  weapon,  which

always appears in the wielders

hand, ready for use. Pressing the

stud to fold or unfold the weapon is a

free action.

If you use the Sleight of Hand skill to conceal a folded

hideaway weapon, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on your

check. Since the folded weapon  ts easily in your hand, you

can attempt to conceal a weapon of any size.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

shrink item; Price +7,500 gp.

SPECIFIC WEAPONS

The elven af nity with swords and bows reaches its apotheosis

with the swordbow.

Swordbow: The magical swordbow takes the concept of

the elvencraft bow (see page 166) and does it one better. As

the name implies, the weapon can transform from a sword to

a bow (or vice versa) upon a mere thought by the wielder (a

free action). A wielder can even interchange bow and sword

attacks as part of the same full attack action.

In sword form, the weapon features a bowlike grip and a

pommel that resembles the curving tip of a bow. The blade

is often decorated with an arrow. In bow form, the weapon is

made of metal, and each half of the bows arc resembles a

sword blade.

In either form, a sword bow has the same enhancement bo-

nus. A swordbows enhancement bonus can be improved as if

improving two separate weapons (for example, improving a

+1 swordbow to a +2 swordbow costs 12,000 gp, just as if you

were improving two +1 weapons to +2). A swordbow may

have special abilities added to it (such as  aming); such abili-

ties cost twice the normal amount (again, as if improving

two separate weapons) and apply to both weapons if pos-

sible. If a special ability is added

that cant apply to both weapons

(such  as  vorpal  or  distance),  it

applies  only  to  the  swordbow

when it is in an eligible form

(for  instance,  a  +1  swordbow  of

distance is a distance weapon

only in bow form).

Cost 3,650 gp + 240 XP (light swordbow), 3,690 gp + 240 XP

(swordbow), or 4,150 gp + 240 XP (great swordbow).

ARMOR SPECIAL ABILITY

Elf, raptoran, and hal ing magic armors focus on lightness

and utility. The races of the wild like to get as much use as

possible out of the weight they carry.

Woodwalk: Armor with this special ability allows the wearer

to enter a tree and exit from another tree as if under the effect of

tree stride, but only if he has the woodland stride ability. Using

this ability is a free action, but the wearer can use it only three

times each day (that is, he can enter one tree and exit from

another one on three occasions in 24 hours). Woodwalk armor

is a favorite among elf and raptoran druids and rangers.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and

SPECIFIC ARMORS

Elves, halings, and raptorans are adept at crafting armors

precisely suited to life in the wilds.

Bearskin Armor: A favorite of many elf ghters and bar-

barians, this +5 breastplate has an outer layer of shaggy brown

or black fur. The wearer can use bears endurance on himself

once a day. The armor also gives the wearer a +2 competence

bonus on grapple checks.

For up to 10 rounds a day, the wearer gains the scent special

quality (see page 314 of the Monster Manual). Activating this

effect is a free action; the rounds when this effect is in use need

not be continuous.

As a free action, the wearer can cause the armor to sprout

up to 10 rounds a day, and those rounds need

not be continuous.

WONDROUS ITEMS

As  with  their  armor,  wondrous  items  crafted  by  elves,

raptorans, or halings focus on utility and portability.

Belt of Hidden Pouches: This item might be made of silk

or soft leather, but its always fairly wide and with a big buckle

(usually brass or silver). Hidden inside the belt are ten small

pockets, each of which seems big enough to hold only a few

coins. Each pocket actually functions as a small bag of holding

and can hold up to 1/2 cubic foot or 5 pounds of nonliving

material. No object with any dimension exceeding 6 inches

can be placed in a pocket. Anything placed inside a pocket

effectively has only one-tenth of its normal weight, so a full

pocket weighs only half a pound at most.

In  addition,  two  secret  pockets  lie  behind  each  visible

one, for a total of thirty pockets in all. The hidden pockets

can be accessed only through a command word. A true seeing

spell reveals the presence of the hidden pockets but not the

command needed to open them.

Even when a pocket is full, it never bulges, so a belt of

hidden pouches stuffed with 150 pounds of items looks like

an ordinary belt.

Accessing any pocket (including the hidden ones) is a move

action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To place

any object in the belt, the wearer merely presses the object

into the belt. Doing so while speaking the command word

places the object in one of the hidden pockets (if one of them

is empty). Naming a stored object and speaking a second com-

mand word draws the named object out of the belt and places

it in the wearers hand (though he could also simply reach

into one of the ten regular pockets and draw it forth, just as if

retrieving a stored object (a move action that provokes attacks

of opportunity; see page 141 of the Players Handbook.

Simply frisking the wearer wont reveal any objects placed

in the belt, and searching the visible pockets cannot reveal

anything stored in the hidden pockets. It is possible to use a

Sleight of Hand check to pluck something out of one of the

ten visible pockets, but only someone wearing or holding

the belt can access the hidden pockets, and then only with

the correct command word.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, secret

chest; Price 5,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Safewing  Emblem:  This  small  feathered  token  can  be

worn or carried. If the owner falls at least 5 feet, the emblem

becomes a set of feathery wings that allow her to use a feather

fall effect to descend safely from any height up to 180 feet.

The emblem requires no activation. When the owner lands,

the token disappears, its magic expended.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, feather

fall; Price 250 gp.

Survival Pouch: This mundane-looking leather belt pouch

can literally save its users life in the wilderness. Five times

per day, the user of a survival pouch can reach into the bag

and retrieve his choice of one of the items listed below. The

user can draw out the same item ve times in one day, draw

out ve different items, or produce any other combination of

up to ve items. Drawing an item from the bag is a standard

action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Each item lasts for 8 hours unless otherwise indicated.

Trail rations for one Medium creature for one day.

Two  gallons  of  water  stored  in  a  waterskin.  The  bag

disappears if it is emptied completely.

A tent and two bedrolls sized for Medium creatures.

A 50-foot coil of hempen rope, which disappears after 4 hours.

A shovel.

A campre (about 2 feet square). The re can be left to burn, or

it can be pulled apart to produce eight lit torches. Each torch

removed reduces the remaining burning time by 1 hour. If

the re is extinguished, any unburnt portion vanishes.

A composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) and a quiver of 20

arrows. The bow disappears 1 round after the last arrow

has been drawn from the quiver.

A mule with bit, bridle, saddle, and saddlebags. The bit, bridle,

saddle, and saddlebags vanish if removed from the mule.

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving  Throw:  Fortitude  partial;

see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

A  golden  ray  springs  from  your

pointing  nger. You must make a suc-

cessful ranged touch attack to hit your

intended target.

A corpse or undead creature struck

by the ray takes 1d8 points of damage

per two caster levels (maximum 10d8).

Any Large or smaller creature reduced

to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is

disintegrated,  leaving  behind  only  a

174

trace of  ne dust. The ray has no effect

on objects that are not corpses; thus, the

creatures equipment is unaffected.

A creature that makes a successful

Fortitude takes half damage.

ENDURING FLIGHT

Transmutation

Level: Sky 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: See text

environment.

RAPTORS SIGHT

Transmutation

Level:  Druid  1,  ranger  1,

Sky 1

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard

action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

You can carry more weight aloft while

flying,  and  your  flight  lasts  longer

than  normal.  You  can   y  at  normal

speed  when  wearing  medium  armor

or  carrying  up  to  a  medium  load.  If

your ability to  y (whether natural or

magical)  has  a  limited  duration,  that

long as you remain airborne; it ends the

moment you land.

MASTERY OF THE SKY

Transmutation [Air]

Level: Sky 8

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

The  air  around  you  shapes  itself  to

assist you and interfere with your foes

attacks. While airborne, you gain a +2

competence bonus on attack rolls and

damage  rolls.  Your  maneuverability

becomes perfect, and your movement

(whether  airborne  or  not)  is  unaf-

fected by winds of less than hurricane

strength  (see  page  95  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide).

The  winds  whipping  around  you

(the equivalent of a windstorm) cause

ranged  weapon  attacks  made  against

you to automatically miss, and even

siege  weapons  take  a  4  penalty  on

attack rolls. Melee attacks made against

you by Huge or smaller creatures have

a 50% miss chance. Medium or smaller

creatures cannot enter your space (such

as to bull rush you or tumble through

your space).

Your  visual  acuity  improves  dra-

matically. You gain a +5 competence

bonus on Spot checks. If you have 5 or

more ranks in Spot, you take only half

the normal range increment penalty for

ranged attacks (1 per range increment

instead of 2).

Though the mysteries of the mind are

not  closely  associated  with  the  races

of  the  wild,  like  all  races  the  elves,

hal ings, and raptorans have developed

certain psionic powers that harness or

augment their natural tendencies.

CONTRARIAN URGE

Telepathy

Level: Psion/wilder 3

Display: Auditory and visual

Manifesting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: Will negates

Power Resistance: Yes

Power Points: 5

Contrarian urge forces its target to do

the opposite of its general intent for

a few seconds. A brief but uncontrol-

lable  urge  dominates  the  thoughts

of  the  subject,  who  will  act  on  that

urge to the best of its ability during

its next turn.

When manifested during combat,

contrarian  urge  almost  always  con-

vinces  its  subject  to  attack  an  ally

rather than a foe. In a social situation,

it  usually  means  the  subject  says

something  inappropriate  or  insult-

ing (imposing a 10 penalty on any

Diplomacy  or  Bluff  check  being

made). The subject comes to its senses

at  the  end  of  its  turn  and  can  act

normally thereafter.

Augment: For every 3 additional

power points you spend, this powers

save DC increases by 1, and the power

can  affect  an  additional  target.  Any

additional  target  cannot  be  more

than  15  feet  from  another  target  of

the power.

LIVING ARROW

Metacreativity

Level: Psychic warrior 5

Display: Auditory

Manifesting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Projectile weapon touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

Power Resistance: Yes (object)

Power Points: 9

NEW PSIONIC POWERS

NEW PSIONIC POWERS

(assuming  you  have  multiple  attacks

per round with that ranged weapon).

2.  If  you  spend  2  additional  power

points, you gain a brief vision of your

target from the arrows point of view

(as if you had manifested the clairvoyant

sense power; see page 83 of the Expanded

Psionics Handbook). You see the target

for  only  a  fraction  of  a  second,  and

the vision ends when the arrow either

strikes its target or fails to reach it.

When  you  manifest  living  arrow,  you

give  a  semblance  of  life  to  the  pro-

jectiles  you  shoot  at  your  foes  (often

arrows  red from a bow, but crossbow

bolts,  sling  stones,  and  other  projec-

tile  weapons  are  also  subject  to  this

power).  The  power  affects  the   rst

projectile you  re each round, granting

it semisentience and the ability to alter

its course in mid- ight.

You can launch a living arrow at a target

known to you and within the maximum

range  of  the  weapon.  The  living  arrow

travels to the target, even around corners.

Only  an  unavoidable  obstacle  or  the

limit of the arrows range prevents the

arrow from reaching its target. A closed

door thwarts a living arrow, as does an

otherwise  sealed  chamber.  This  effect

negates  cover  and  concealment  modi-

 ers, but the attack is otherwise rolled

normally. The arrow retains any magical

properties it would otherwise have, such

as an enhancement bonus from the bow

or the arrow itself.

Augment:  You  can  augment  this

power in one or both of the following

ways.

1.  For  every  additional  3  power

points you spend, you can launch an

additional  living  arrow  each  round

TELEKINETIC

BOOMERANG

Psychokinesis

Level: Kineticist 3, psychic warrior 3

Display: Visual

Manifesting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Touch

Target: One object

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

Power Resistance: Yes (object)

Power Points: 5

You  can  imbue  an  object  with  an

unusually  fast-acting  version  of  the

returning  weapon  special  ability,  so

that it returns to you an instant after its

attack resolves. Hal ings with psionic

powers often use telekinetic boomerang

on daggers or throwing axes.

Unlike a weapon with the return-

ing  special  ability  (see  page  225  of

the Dungeon Masters Guide), an object

imbued  with  telekinetic  boomerang

returns to the throwers hand imme-

diately  after  the  attack  is  resolved,

allowing the weapon to be used again

on the same turn.

Augment: For every additional 2

power points you spend, you can imbue

an additional object with the bene t of

telekinetic boomerang.

lves, halflings, raptorans, and their kindred

offer a wealth of ideas that a Dungeon Master

can use to make his campaign more varied and

interesting. This chapter provides advice on

tailoring the campaign guidelines from the

Dungeon Masters Guide to characters and cultures inspired

by  this  book,  including  sample  NPCs  for  a  variety  of

challenge ratings. It also includes new creatures the PCs

might befriend.

ASSEMBLING THE GROUP

Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide addresses ve basic

ways to bring an adventuring party together; the descriptions

included there apply to a group of characters including races

and material from this book just as they do to any group,

though a few twists might be in order.

Happenstance: Characters might come together as the

result of some disaster or other notable event. Perhaps a raging

forest re sends refugees scurrying to safety, and the PCs

happen to arrive at the same place of refuge to be charged

with escorting the old and sick away from danger, or perhaps

they all answer the call to ght the re and nd themselves

thrown together afterward.

History: Elf, halfling, and raptoran characters have

ample opportunities to get to know each other over the

years. All the characters might hail from an area where an

elf town stands near a raptoran ocks territory, a locale

visited regularly by haling caravans. Perhaps the charac-

ters simply grew up together. Between the elven practice

of  fostering  children  and  the  halings  propensity  for

adopting orphans, the members of almost any group

could have been childhood friends.

Mutual Acquaintance: Elf elders, haling heralds,

and raptoran sunspeakers make contact with many

people  of  all  kinds  and  make  excellent  advisors  and

mentors for beginning adventuring groups.

Outside Intervention: It isnt very likely that a

group of new characters could come together at the

behest of a single NPC unless they all live in the

same community. Groups of inuential NPCs, such

as some of the prestige classes described in Chapter

5 of this book, might send individual PCs to join a

combined effort.

The Clich: It is certainly possible for a group of

PCs to come together at a crossroads, border town,

or roadside inn. They might also meet when a haling

caravan comes to a town and sets up for business.

THE SETTING

A  campaign  focusing  on  one  of  the  races  covered  in  this

book is likely to feature wilderness locales far away from

cities. Adventures will take place in secluded valleys, among

trackless forests, and along long, lonely roads. Urban and

underground  adventures  might  prove  rare.  This  sort  of

campaign will impact play in several ways.

Regional Scope: The action in the campaign probably

will focus on an entire region rather than on one settle-

ment or dungeon. Characters will make long overland treks

fairly often as they pursue adventures in widely separated

locales. Most of their best friends and worst enemies will

be far away from wherever the group happens to be at any

given time.

Slower  Pace:  Encounters  may  occur  several  days  apart

when the PCs make a long wilderness trek, allowing them

ample  time  to  recover  their  strength  between  challenges.

Individual encounters can be tougher (and often should be)

because the PCs can start them with full hit points and full

complements of spells and class features.

On the other hand, it could be days or weeks before they

can replenish their supplies. Groups that run out of potions,

scrolls, alchemists re, silvered arrows, or other exhaustible

supplies may nd otherwise easy challenges more difcult

than usual. A long adventure undertaken with inadequate

supplies can be a real struggle for groups that dont plan

adequately. Even groups gifted with good foresight might

take days or weeks to complete simple tasks. The DM must

set the pace of events accordingly (at least until the party

gains access to teleportation magic or some other means of

rapid travel).

Sprawling Encounters: Most encounters will take place

outdoors. Indoor and underground encounters are conned

within the bounds of chambers and halls, and ghting takes

place at close range, with little time or room for maneuvering

before the two sides close to melee.

Outdoors, however, encounters can take place at distances

limited only by the extent of vision, which can be consider-

able  indeed.  Ranged  combat  is  common,  and  both  sides

usually have ample time and space to maneuver and use the

terrain to advantage.

DEMOGRAPHICS

Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide provides guidelines

for  randomly  generating  communities  of  various  sizes.

However, the communities described there are designed

to  mirror  average  communities  throughout  a  campaign

world and therefore favor humans as the most numerous

members of any community. To create racial communi-

ties that feel different from human communities, use the

following guidelines.

ELF COMMUNITIES

Elves rarely form big communities. They crave open spaces

and try to minimize their impact on the land. As such, elf

communities are generally smaller and farther apart than

human communities. Such communities also usually have

a nearly homogenous population. The exceptions are major

political, religious, or scholastic centersplaces that cannot

function well without a large number of people.

Elf communities have the normal gold piece limit for

purchases. However, the gold piece limit when purchasing

special items of elven manufacture (such as elven harps and

cloaks of elvenkind) is 50% higher than the indicated value.

The  same  increase  applies  for  items  that  elves  use  often

(both magical and mundane), including projectile weapons,

ammunition, light armor, scrolls, and potions.

Elf communities use the general guidelines for determin-

ing power centers, power center alignment, and highest-level

locals given in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide, except

as noted here.

HALFLING COMMUNITIES

Haling communities are generally smaller and farther apart

than communities of other races.

Halfling  communities  use  the  general  guidelines  for

determining power centers, power center alignment, and

highest-level  locals  given  in  Chapter  5  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide.

Permanent haling communities usually have a mercantile

base; the gold piece limit for purchasing items is doubled in

such communities.

2 In a permanent community (not a caravan), use twice

this value when setting the maximum value of items

available for sale.

3 Most caravans use these values when on the move.

4 Halfling large cities and metropolises exist only where

the DM chooses and are never generated randomly.

Elf communities usually get along without a visible police

force, but unseen sentries are on hand to quell trouble. Elves

are tolerant, but they can afford to be because they dont tend

to disrupt other lives.

Because so many elves work magic, elf communities tend

to have magical power centers. (The chance for an elf com-

munity to have a magical power center is considerably higher

than suggested on the Power Centers table on page 137 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide.)

Elf communities also tend toward chaotic power centers

most of the time, with chaotic good being most common

(see Table 86). Lawful elf settlements usually have some

connection with Vandria Gilmadrith (clerics of Vandria

may hold power, or key citizens may be her worshipers).

Likewise,  evil  settlements  often  have  some  connection

with Lolth.

RAPTORAN COMMUNITIES

Raptoran communities are even smaller and more scattered

than elf communities. A raptoran ock seldom has more than

100 adults. You can use  the values on Table 81 for raptoran

communities; 75% of them will be camps and 25% will be

outposts. Reduce the community gold piece limit by 50%;

raptorans have little money and seldom have goods for sale.

In any case, raptorans would rather barter for useful items

than accept money.

Use the table on page 137 of the Dungeon Masters Guide  to

determine the type of power center in a raptoran community.

Use Table 86, below, to determine a raptoran communitys

power center alignment.

Visiting a raptoran ock is much like visiting an isolated elf

community, except that strangers are unlikely to be admitted

to the ocks spiral tower or rock-cut cliff dwelling. Raptorans

are nocturnal, so their communities are active by night and

silent by day.

ADVENTURING IN

ELF COMMUNITIES

An elf community (or an elf enclave in a city where elves

are in the minority) looks more like a garden than city to

nonelves. There are few true streets; instead, paths wind

through groves of stately trees. Flowers and decorative

shrubs grow everywhere. Many building are raised on stilts

or perched in trees.

Elves  usually  treat  well-behaved  visitors  with  hospitality.

Guests can expect a welcoming meal, minor services such

as baths, laundering, and repair of travel-worn equipment,

and modest accommodations (usually not much more than

a dry place to sleep). Elves value self-sufciency, so visitors

are expected to move on after a day or two unless they have

been invited to stay longer.

Elves respect individual rights but place the welfare of

their own citizens above the freedom of visitors to do what

they please. Guests who commit misdeeds are usually pun-

ished by requiring them to undo the damage (in whatever

form that might take) and compensate the community elders

for  their  time  and  trouble  in  dealing  with  the  problem.

THE SETTING

A  campaign  focusing  on  one  of  the  races  covered  in  this

book is likely to feature wilderness locales far away from

cities. Adventures will take place in secluded valleys, among

trackless forests, and along long, lonely roads. Urban and

underground  adventures  might  prove  rare.  This  sort  of

campaign will impact play in several ways.

Regional Scope: The action in the campaign probably

will focus on an entire region rather than on one settle-

ment or dungeon. Characters will make long overland treks

fairly often as they pursue adventures in widely separated

locales. Most of their best friends and worst enemies will

be far away from wherever the group happens to be at any

given time.

Slower  Pace:  Encounters  may  occur  several  days  apart

when the PCs make a long wilderness trek, allowing them

ample  time  to  recover  their  strength  between  challenges.

Individual encounters can be tougher (and often should be)

because the PCs can start them with full hit points and full

complements of spells and class features.

On the other hand, it could be days or weeks before they

can replenish their supplies. Groups that run out of potions,

scrolls, alchemists re, silvered arrows, or other exhaustible

supplies may nd otherwise easy challenges more difcult

than usual. A long adventure undertaken with inadequate

supplies can be a real struggle for groups that dont plan

adequately. Even groups gifted with good foresight might

take days or weeks to complete simple tasks. The DM must

set the pace of events accordingly (at least until the party

gains access to teleportation magic or some other means of

rapid travel).

Sprawling Encounters: Most encounters will take place

outdoors. Indoor and underground encounters are conned

within the bounds of chambers and halls, and ghting takes

place at close range, with little time or room for maneuvering

before the two sides close to melee.

Outdoors, however, encounters can take place at distances

limited only by the extent of vision, which can be consider-

able  indeed.  Ranged  combat  is  common,  and  both  sides

usually have ample time and space to maneuver and use the

terrain to advantage.

DEMOGRAPHICS

Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide provides guidelines

for  randomly  generating  communities  of  various  sizes.

However, the communities described there are designed

to  mirror  average  communities  throughout  a  campaign

world and therefore favor humans as the most numerous

members of any community. To create racial communi-

ties that feel different from human communities, use the

following guidelines.

ELF COMMUNITIES

Elves rarely form big communities. They crave open spaces

and try to minimize their impact on the land. As such, elf

communities are generally smaller and farther apart than

human communities. Such communities also usually have

a nearly homogenous population. The exceptions are major

political, religious, or scholastic centersplaces that cannot

function well without a large number of people.

Elf communities have the normal gold piece limit for

purchases. However, the gold piece limit when purchasing

special items of elven manufacture (such as elven harps and

cloaks of elvenkind) is 50% higher than the indicated value.

The  same  increase  applies  for  items  that  elves  use  often

(both magical and mundane), including projectile weapons,

ammunition, light armor, scrolls, and potions.

Elf communities use the general guidelines for determin-

ing power centers, power center alignment, and highest-level

locals given in Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Masters Guide, except

as noted here.

HALFLING COMMUNITIES

Haling communities are generally smaller and farther apart

than communities of other races.

Halfling  communities  use  the  general  guidelines  for

determining power centers, power center alignment, and

highest-level  locals  given  in  Chapter  5  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide.

Permanent haling communities usually have a mercantile

base; the gold piece limit for purchasing items is doubled in

such communities.

halfling community ranges from 25% to 30% of the adult

population.

2 In a permanent community (not a caravan), use twice

this value when setting the maximum value of items

available for sale.

3 Most caravans use these values when on the move.

4 Halfling large cities and metropolises exist only where

the DM chooses and are never generated randomly.

Elf communities usually get along without a visible police

force, but unseen sentries are on hand to quell trouble. Elves

are tolerant, but they can afford to be because they dont tend

to disrupt other lives.

Because so many elves work magic, elf communities tend

to have magical power centers. (The chance for an elf com-

munity to have a magical power center is considerably higher

than suggested on the Power Centers table on page 137 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide.)

Elf communities also tend toward chaotic power centers

most of the time, with chaotic good being most common

(see Table 86). Lawful elf settlements usually have some

connection with Vandria Gilmadrith (clerics of Vandria

may hold power, or key citizens may be her worshipers).

Likewise,  evil  settlements  often  have  some  connection

with Lolth.

RAPTORAN COMMUNITIES

Raptoran communities are even smaller and more scattered

than elf communities. A raptoran ock seldom has more than

100 adults. You can use  the values on Table 81 for raptoran

communities; 75% of them will be camps and 25% will be

outposts. Reduce the community gold piece limit by 50%;

raptorans have little money and seldom have goods for sale.

In any case, raptorans would rather barter for useful items

than accept money.

Use the table on page 137 of the Dungeon Masters Guide  to

determine the type of power center in a raptoran community.

Use Table 86, below, to determine a raptoran communitys

power center alignment.

Visiting a raptoran ock is much like visiting an isolated elf

community, except that strangers are unlikely to be admitted

to the ocks spiral tower or rock-cut cliff dwelling. Raptorans

are nocturnal, so their communities are active by night and

silent by day.

ADVENTURING IN

ELF COMMUNITIES

An elf community (or an elf enclave in a city where elves

are in the minority) looks more like a garden than city to

nonelves. There are few true streets; instead, paths wind

through groves of stately trees. Flowers and decorative

shrubs grow everywhere. Many building are raised on stilts

or perched in trees.

HALFLING COMMUNITIES

Hal ings, the smallest of the common races, usually build

to suit their own stature. Gnomes will  nd the furnishings,

doorways, and ceiling height of hal ing dwellings fairly

comfortable (if slightly cramped), but most other characters

will feel a bit like adults visiting a room sized for children

and their toys. Businesses that cater to nonhal ings will

have doorways, ceilings, and at least some furniture tall or

large enough to accommodate Medium folk, but even in such

places taller characters, especially humans and half-orcs, will

bump their heads from time to time.

Most of the activity in a hal ing settlement is commercial

and social. Hal ings and their visitors usually have little

time or inclination for anything except buying and selling.

Because many hal ings have a larcenous streak, visitors must

beware of pickpockets and scam artists.

Use the table on page 137 of the Dungeon Masters Guide  to

determine the type of power center in a hal ing community.

Characters who visit a hal ing community can expect to  nd

comfortable  quarters  of  appropriate  dimensions  at  an  inn

or travelers hostel. These accommodations are never free,

though the proprietor may hand out complimentary refresh-

ments of some kind in good or neutral towns. Visitors rooms

in good or neutral communities will be equipped with sturdy

locks and bars or bolts on the inside (just to make guests feel

secure). Accommodations  in evil communities have locks

and bolts as wellin addition to secret entrances to some

rooms that are kept locked from the outside.

Guests of a caravan on the move are treated to at least one

free meal (though a caravan might not have much to share)

and are welcome to share the camp. Hal ing hosts always

prove curious, and guests receive numerous invitations to

relate tales of their recent adventures. A visitors failure to

relate a tale invariably causes great disappointment.

Hal ings  usually  have  a  fairly  lax  attitude  toward  non-

violent crimes, especially when they commit such crimes

against their visitors. Victims of petty crimes seldom get any

satisfaction in a hal ing community. A cut purse or a  lched

item brings sympathetic words from community authorities

but little more. Anyone who loses a particularly valuable item

can buy help in getting it back, for the right price. Should

the PCs manage to foil an attempt to steal from them, the

hal ings justice is swifthal ings have a low tolerance for

failure among their own. Hal ings also have a low tolerance

for violence directed against them, and characters who try

to take the law into their own hands will earn a quick escort

out of the settlement.

SAMPLE NPCS

The following NPCs include individuals player characters

are likely to interact with when approaching a community

of that race; these sample characters should make it easier for

the DM to design and run adventures set in the wilds.

The NPCs detailed here span low-level to mid-level play

and present some of the archetypes of the races of the wild.

Although these NPCs have good or neutral alignments, the

DM can use them as foes simply by changing their alignments

and alignment-related abilities (such as a clerics domains and

a rangers favored enemies).

Dexterity bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to

ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures

with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies,

and  creatures  immune  to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits

are all immune to sneak attacks. The burglar can choose to

deliver  nonlethal  damage  with  his  sneak  attack,  but  only

more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering

or disarming it.

Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  even  when  at-footed  or

targeted by an unseen foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus

HOLIDAYS

Overlooked in many campaigns, holidays provide a simple

and interesting way to convey a races culture and beliefs.

When the adventurers enter a haling camp during a Clan

Meet, they cant help but notice that halings are sharing and

swapping news with great efciency; haling culture seems

more completely developed because of this ourish.

Holidays shouldnt be common occurrences; in most cases,

a little goes a long way. Most cultures should have only three

or four major holidays in each year, but individual DMs have

plenty of room to go beyond this guideline for special races

or cultures. Remember, too, that holidays need not all be

annual events. A holiday that comes only once every four

hundred years might have more signicance (and therefore

more substantial game effects) than an annual celebration.

A holiday that occurs every month will have a much greater

chance of affecting an adventure than one that occurs only

once a year, and will therefore play a much greater role in

the campaign.

Holidays can also serve to differentiate groups within a

race or culturereligious holidays are the most common

example of this kind of holiday, but guilds, clans, or any other

group  might  have  holidays  of  its  own.  These  can  provide

a particularly interesting insight into a setting when they

differ noticeably from the main culture around them. For

example, the raptorans of the White Chalk Cliffs might not

worship Tuilviel Glithien and hence not celebrate the Long

Night. Perhaps they even have an antithetical holiday on the

summer solstice. This unusual custom might cause strained

relations  or  even  conicts  with  raptorans  who  revere  the

Queen of Air and Night.

The section below details sample holidays that you can

include  in  your  campaign.  Although  the  holidays  are

split between races, feel free to choose among them or

create your own if they better fit another race or culture

in your campaign.

ELF HOLIDAYS

Elf communities host a wide variety of seasonal festivals.

In addition, they often hold a party or feast to celebrate the

ofcial appointing of a new captain of the watch, master

builder,  or  other  ofcial.  Elven  holidays  tend  to  be  grand

community-wide events.

Arrow Meet and Arrow Sunder: Once a season, the

elves in a local militia gather for two days of training and

competition.  On  the  rst  day,  they  divide  into  teams  and

hold  a  capture-the-ag  wargame,  using  blunt  arrows  (see

page 163) that sting but deliver only nonlethal damage. The

rst game ends at dusk. Participants then form new teams,

mixing the victors and the losers, and hold a second game

that lasts from dusk to dawn.

On the second day, individual achievement is celebrated by

an extremely competitive archery tournament. The second

night ends with a festival that recognizes the achivements

of the victors.

During Arrow Meet and Arrow Sunder, all elves gain a +1

morale bonus on attacks with ranged weapons.

Childs Play: Once every four years in times of peace and

prosperity, elf communities celebrate their young by having

a day during which age-dependent roles are reversed. The

children are given free rein to do as they please and be in

charge. They can ask any question, pursue any activity, and

enlist adults help in any of their ventures. This holiday allows

children an opportunity to experiment with leadership roles

or to simply relax and be silly. Its a day of experimentation

and fun.

On the day of Childs Play, all elves gain a +4 morale bonus

on saves against fear effects.

Spring Revel: As spring stirs the sap in the trees, elves

feel nature renew their spirits. After a long winter, elves

welcome  the  return  of  spring  with  a  grand  affair.  The

Spring Revel is an event hosted by the clerics and follow-

ers of Alobal Lorril (see page 20), but its more a secular

than  a  religious  festival,  and  folk  of  all  faiths  happily

participate. The festivities last for ve days, during which

elves celebrate the crafts they have practiced and the skills

they have honed over the winter months. A large area is set

up for elves to buy, sell, or simply display their creations.

Events during the festival include singing, dancing, story-

telling, archery and swordplay competitions, wine tasting,

and demonstrations of new innovations in magic spells

and items.

During Spring Revel, all elves gain a +1 morale bonus on

Perform checks.

HALFLING HOLIDAYS

Halflings work hard and play hard. They enjoy festivals,

even more so when others are doing the work and providing

the food. Often the travels of a halfling caravan include

arrivals and sojourns timed to coincide with the nearby

friendly  community  hosting  a  celebration.  Thus,  they

often  benefit  from  other  races  holidays  in  addition  to

their own.

Clan Circle: Once every ve years, members of a clan

gather together to conduct clan business and catch up on

clan gossip. The event has an odd mixture of seriousness

and triviality. The main purpose is seriousselecting the

clan elder (or conrming the current one to continue in that

role). However, such large gatherings being rare, the event

gives a welcome opportunity for sharing of news, socializing,

and sport.

On the rst day of a Clan Circle, halings gain a +1 morale

bonus on Gather Information checks.

Clan Meet: When two haling caravans encounter each

other, they often unite to spend a few days camping or travel-

ing together. Its a time of frivolity, with much boasting and

telling of tales to impress the other clan. Often, unattached

halings use this opportunity to meet and irt with a variety

of romantic prospects (especially important since romantic

relationships with clan-kin are discouraged). After spending

several delightful days together, the caravans will separate

again,  sometimes  with  new  handfasted  partners  from  the

other clan.

During the rst week of a Clan Meet, halings gain a +1

morale bonus on Bluff checks.

All  Meet:  When  a  matter  of  grave  importance  to  all

halings comes up, word is passed from caravan to caravan

and clan to clan to come to the All Meet, a gathering of many

different clans. Even clanless halings attend.  This event is

exceedingly rare and is only scheduled to discuss matters of

world-shaking importance.

During an All Meet, halings gain a +2 morale bonus on

Will saves

RAPTORAN HOLIDAYS

Raptoran life is rich with traditions and holidays. Most family

and age-mates have days of remembrance for events special

just to them. They celebrate the anniversaries of signicant

happenings such as their Wingsweeps (see below), meeting

a dear friend, or acquiring a unusual item. These dates are

rarely recorded or remembered with precision, which leads

to many arguments and apologies for forgetting someones

special day.

Long Night: Raptorans who worship or respect Tuilviel

Glithien celebrate the winter equinox, the longest night

of the year. Those that fall on a night of the full moon

or  new  moon  are  especially  boisterous.  The  festivities

begin at dusk and end at dawn. This holiday is a celebra-

tion of the joyfulness of life. Since food is scarce during

the  winter,  theres  no  feasting.  Instead,  the  raptorans

Flight of the Lady (see page 77) at midnight. Many unat-

tached raptorans choose their seasons mate on this night.

Eggs conceived during the Long Night are supposed to be

particularly blessed.

During the Long Night, raptorans  y speed increases by

5 feet.

Wingsweep: A raptorans return from her Walk of the

Four Winds is marked with a great ceremony celebrating

her successful rite of passage. This event is always held in

a cavern or chamber that can only be reached by flying

creatures  and  presided  over  by  a  priest  of  Duthila  (see

page  77).  The  returning  raptoran  is  welcomed  and  the

community  proclaims  her  entry  into  full  adulthood.  It

is during this ceremony that the raptoran announces her

adult name, taking her place among them. She then plucks

a feather from her wing and adds it to the communitys

collection of feathers. The solemn rites conclude with the

raptoran making an aerial circuit of the settlement. Once

she returns to the cave, merriment and feasting replace

the earlier somber tone.

During  Wingsweep,  all  raptorans  who  can   y  gain  3

temporary hit points.

OTHER HOLIDAYS

Creating new holidays for your campaign is relatively simple.

Although most holidays do not have game effects associated

with them, those that do can quickly become important

events in a campaign.

Regardless  of  race,  class,  or  cultural  affiliation,  no

character  should  have  access  to  more  than  three  major

holidays with game effects. In addition, be careful about

giving significant combat benefits to holidays that last

for more than a day or two. Table 88 provides a list of

occasions that might be celebrated with holidays, along

with suggestions for how long the holiday would last and

the game effect associated with those who take part in

the celebration.

FRIENDS OF THE WILD

Elves, hal ings, raptorans, and other races of the wild typi-

cally see the creatures of their homelands as allies, rather

than as prey or enemies. Here are a few potential friends for

slightly  tough,  but  well   avored  (though

many people  nd the taste overly strong).

Well-fed females produce milk for about

nine months out of a year, and a well-man-

aged herd can produce milk year-round.

Both  does  and  bucks  produce  a   eece

suitable for making woolen cloth.

Brixashulties  are  surefooted,  even-

tempered, and fairly strong. They make excellent

pack and draft animals. They can carry riders of up to

Small size.

Combat

Brixashulties remain alert and sensitive to the presence of

intruders or predators. In spite of their even temper, they

become aggressive in the presence of strange sight, sounds, or

smells. When annoyed, they tend to charge foes and deliver a

dangerous gore attack. In a battle, brixashulties instinctively

band together to guard each others  anks and to concentrate

their attacks; using this tactic, a herd of brixashulties can

often fend off a pack of wolves.

Knockback (Ex): A gore attack from a brixashulty can lit-

erally drive back a foe. When a brixa hits with its gore attack,

it can immediately attempt a bull rush without entering the

foes space or provoking an attack of opportunity. The brixa

makes a Strength check with a +7 bonus, which includes a

+4 racial bonus. If the bull rush succeeds, the foe is driven

back 5 feet and must make a DC 12 Re ex save or fall down.

If being driven back would force the opponent into a barrier

or into a square where it cannot stop (such as a wall or a square

that already contains another creature), the foe falls down in

its square instead. The Re ex save DC is Strength-based.

Skills:  A  brixashulty  has  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Balance,

Jump, and Listen checks. A brixashulty uses its Dexterity

modi er for Jump checks.

The brixashulty (brixa for short) is a goatlike creature that

the hal ings have bred to serve a beast of burden, guard

animal, and source of food and  ber for textiles. Halflings

like to boast that a brixashulty is a surefooted as a mule,

Training a Brixashulty

A character with the Handle Animal skill can train a brixa-

shulty as noted in the Handle Animal skill description on

pages 7475 of the Players Handbook.

Brixashulty

A creature of up to Small size can ride a brixashulty using

a riding saddle or a military saddle. A brixashulty trained

for combat riding can  ght while carrying a rider, but the

rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a DC

10 Ride check.

A brixashulty kid is worth 30 gp and is ready for train-

ing by age two. It can live for up to 50 years. Brixashulties

bucks are usually trained for combat riding. Brixashulty

does are usually trained for guarding and also know the

work  and  stay  tricks.  A  fully  trained  adult  brixashulty

costs 150 gp.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a brixashulty is up to

75 pounds; a medium load, 76150 pounds; and a heavy load,

151225 pounds.

Brixashulties as Animal Companions

A hal ing who has the animal companion class feature can

choose a brixashulty as an animal companion.

A nonhal ing also can have a brixashulty companion, but

her effective level for the animal companion class feature

must be 4th or higher, and her effective level for deter-

mining the brixashulty companions abilities is reduced

by three. For example, if a 4th-level half-elf druid has a

brixashulty companion, that brixashulty has only 1st-level

companion abilities.

amuse themselves and each other by storytelling, races,

and other activities. One highlight of the festival is the

Flight of the Lady (see page 77) at midnight. Many unat-

tached raptorans choose their seasons mate on this night.

Eggs conceived during the Long Night are supposed to be

particularly blessed.

During the Long Night, raptorans  y speed increases by

5 feet.

Wingsweep: A raptorans return from her Walk of the

Four Winds is marked with a great ceremony celebrating

her successful rite of passage. This event is always held in

a cavern or chamber that can only be reached by flying

creatures  and  presided  over  by  a  priest  of  Duthila  (see

page  77).  The  returning  raptoran  is  welcomed  and  the

community  proclaims  her  entry  into  full  adulthood.  It

is during this ceremony that the raptoran announces her

adult name, taking her place among them. She then plucks

a feather from her wing and adds it to the communitys

collection of feathers. The solemn rites conclude with the

raptoran making an aerial circuit of the settlement. Once

she returns to the cave, merriment and feasting replace

the earlier somber tone.

During  Wingsweep,  all  raptorans  who  can   y  gain  3

temporary hit points.

OTHER HOLIDAYS

Creating new holidays for your campaign is relatively simple.

Although most holidays do not have game effects associated

with them, those that do can quickly become important

events in a campaign.

Regardless  of  race,  class,  or  cultural  affiliation,  no

character  should  have  access  to  more  than  three  major

holidays with game effects. In addition, be careful about

giving significant combat benefits to holidays that last

for more than a day or two. Table 88 provides a list of

occasions that might be celebrated with holidays, along

with suggestions for how long the holiday would last and

the game effect associated with those who take part in

the celebration.

FRIENDS OF THE WILD

Elves, hal ings, raptorans, and other races of the wild typi-

cally see the creatures of their homelands as allies, rather

than as prey or enemies. Here are a few potential friends for

your wild character.

A brixashulty doe stands about 3 feet tall at

the  shoulder,  measures  about  5  feet  long

uncommon,  and  a  few  have  white  coats

This  sizable  bird  is  bigger  than

a  housecat.  It  has  smoky  gray

plumage with white and black

bars. Its wide but stubby beak

is  fringed  with  long  bristles

that  resemble  a  cats  whis-

kers. The large eyes are black,

rimmed  with  silver.  The  body

seems very short, and the wings

seem very long.

The chordevoc is a nocturnal bird

bred  by  the  hal ings.  Its  call

sounds like a soft whistle, not

unlike a teakettle just coming

to  boil.  Many  people  find  the

sound  similar  to  the  call  of  a

screech  owl,  but  those  who  have

heard both know the chordevocs

call is shriller.

When  left  to  feed  on  its  own,  a

chordevoc corkscrews through the air,

zigzagging  and  sideslipping  so  much

that observers often have dif culty telling the birds

true  ight path.

Hal ings keep chordevocs primarily as guards and hunting

companions, but sometimes simply as pets. Wild populations

of chordevocs exist, but they are fairly rare, usually con-

sisting of widely scattered pairs or lone individuals that

have escaped or become orphaned from the hal ings who

raised them.

Chordevoc

Combat

Chordevocs are bred to attack, and theyre well equipped

for combat in spite of their miniature size and fairly low

Strength scores. A chordevoc prefers to  ght on the wing,

swooping in to slash with its talons (it uses both as a single

attack), then veering away to  y out of reach.

Blindsense (Ex): A chordevoc notices and locates crea-

tures within 60 feet. Opponents still have total concealment

against a creature with blindsense.

Skills: A chordevocs feathers provide excellent camou-

 age, granting it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

A chordevoc has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen

checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsense is negated.

Training a Chordevoc

Chordevocs resist most attempts to tame or train them.

To be trained, a chordevoc must have a friendly attitude

toward the trainer. A chordevoc usually has an indiffer-

ent attitude toward a halfling, but that attitude improves

to  friendly  if  the  halfling  supplies  the  bird  with

treats  for  at  least  a  week  and  other-

wise  treats  it  well.  A  chordevoc

is hostile to most other creatures.

Changing  a  chordevocs  attitude

requires a wild empathy check, or

a Diplomacy check if the character

has some way to communicate with

the creature (such as access to a speak

with animals spell).

Training  a  friendly  chordevoc

requires a Handle Animal check. A

hal ing can train a chordevoc with-

out penalty, but the Handle Animal

DCs for any other trainer increase

by 5. The time required depends on

the tricks or task the chordevoc must

learn, as noted in the Handle Animal

skill description on pages 7475 of

the Players Handbook.

A chordevoc egg is worth

25 gp on the open market, but

eggs are seldom offered for sale.

A chick is worth 150 gp. A chick

is ready for training by the age of six

months and can live for 150 years.

Adult  chordevocs  are  generally

trained  for  hunting  or  for  guarding.  A

fully  trained  chordevoc  costs  at  least

250  gp  on  the  open  market,  if  it  is  offered

for sale at all.

Chordevocs as Animal Companions

This powerful-looking bird of prey bears a bony protrusion on the

upper part of its beak. Several long feathers trail gracefully from

its lower body and tail.

A dire hawk is capable of taking down pigs, sheep, and even

the occasional small horse. This bird of prey prefers high,

remote nesting spots.

A typical dire hawk is about 5 feet long and has a wingspan

Dire Hawks as Animal Companions

A raptoran who has the animal companion class feature

can choose a dire hawk as an alternate animal companion

when his effective level for the animal companion class

feature  is  4th  or  higher.  The  raptorans  effective  druid

This powerful-looking bird of prey bears a bony protrusion on the

upper part of its beak. Several long feathers trail gracefully from

its lower body and tail.

A dire hawk is capable of taking down pigs, sheep, and even

the occasional small horse. This bird of prey prefers high,

remote nesting spots.

A typical dire hawk is about 5 feet long and has a wingspan

of about 11 feet.

Skills: *A dire hawk receives a +8 racial bonus on Spot

checks in daylight.

Dire Hawks as Animal Companions

A raptoran who has the animal companion class feature

can choose a dire hawk as an alternate animal companion

when his effective level for the animal companion class

feature  is  4th  or  higher.  The  raptorans  effective  druid

level for determining the dire hawks abilities is reduced

by three.

Dire hawk

A nonraptoran also can have a dire hawk companion,

but  her  effective  level  for  the  animal  companion  class

feature must be 7th or higher, and the characters effective

level for determining the dire hawks abilities is reduced

by  six.  For  example,  if  a  7th-level  halfling  druid  has  a

dire hawk companion, the dire hawk has only 1st-level

companion abilities.

The  elven  hound  (called  the  cooshee

in Elven) is a massive dog. It is most

commonly found in the company

of wood elves, who use it for both

hunting and guard duties. Occa-

sionally, high elves or gray

elves  will  keep  kennels

of these dogs.

An  elven  hound

weighs more than

200 pounds and

often  stands

as  much  as  2

feet  high  at

the  shoul-

der. Its huge

paws house strong

claws,  which  are

curved to provide better traction in the

soft loam of the forest lands. Its tail gener-

ally arcs over its back, but it hangs between

the creatures legs when the hound is be-

ing scolded. Its ears point straight up,

giving the creature an attentive, intel-

ligent look. Cooshees are long-lived

creatures, commonly reaching 100 years

of age.

Combat

Elven hound

An elven hound is a very effective  ghting

machine. It has a bone-crushing bite, capable

of dropping an orc warrior. Elves say one elven

hound is worth  ve orcs; thats an exaggeration, to be sure,

but an elven hound is a ferocious combatant nevertheless,

especially  when  attacking  prey  distracted  by  a  hail  of

elven arrows.

Resist Enchantment (Ex): Like their elf masters, elven

hounds have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against

enchantment spells or effects.

Sprint (Ex): Although an elven hound can go head to head

with many creatures, its strength lies in the chase. Once per

hour, an elven hound can move  ve times its normal speed

(250 feet) when it makes a charge.

Skills: Elven hounds have a +4 racial bonus on Balance,

Hide, Jump, and Swim checks, and a +2 racial bonus on Listen

and Spot checks. *Elven hounds have a +4 racial bonus on

Survival checks when tracking by scent.

Training an Elven Hound

Although  their  intelligence  is  no  higher  than  that  of  a

typical canine, elven hounds have an independent spirit

and tend to distrust nonelves. To be trained, an elven

hound must have a friendly attitude toward the train-

er. An elven hound usually has a friendly attitude

toward  trainers  who  are  elves  or  who  have  elf

blood (such as half-elves), provided the

trainer  supplies

the  hound  with

sustenance  for  at

least a few days and has

not  attacked  or

mistreated the

creature.  An

elven  hound

is indifferent (at best) toward

most  other  creatures.  Chang-

ing  an  elven  hounds  attitude

requires a wild empathy check

(with  the  normal  4  penalty

applied  against  magical

beasts). A character can

use  a  Diplomacy  check

instead,  provided  the

character has some way

to  communicate  with

the  cooshee,  such  as

access  to  a  speak  with

animals spell.

Training  a  friendly  elven  hound  requires  a

Handle Animal check. An elf (or a creature with

elf blood) can train an elven hound without penalty, but

the Handle Animal DCs for any other trainer increase by

5 (in addition to the normal +5 increase to DCs for train-

ing  a  magical  beast).  The  time  required  depends  on  the

tricks or task the elven hound must learn, as noted in the

Handle  Animal  skill  description  on  pages  7475  of  the

Players Handbook.

An elven hound pup is worth 150 gp on the open market,

but pups are seldom offered for sale. A hound is ready for

training by age two and can live for 50 years. Adult elven

hounds are generally trained for hunting or for guarding. A

fully trained elven hound costs at least 300 gp on the open

market, if it is offered for sale at all.

As noted in Races of the Wild, the Rifinti are fairly typical

as  raptorans  go.  To  uninitiated  visitors,  however,  they

may  seem  decidedly  oddsleeping  during  the  day,

staying  up  all  night,  holding  endless  debates  about

seemingly  trivial  matters,  and  disdaining  wealth  and

personal ornament. In addition, their communal living

and working arrangements are practically unknown in

other cultures. Odder still, the Rifinti seem distrustful

of strangers, yet unstintingly kind to beings in need.

Rifinti Cliff Dwelling is an adventure site that can be

dropped into any area that has a mountain valley, alpine

lakes, and considerable forest cover. Though the Rifinti

tend to shun strangers, those who seek out this area can

find a variety of adventures here. As always, feel free to

adapt the material presented here as you see fit to make

it work with your campaign.

PREPARATION

You  (the  DM)  need  the  D&D  core  rulebooksthe

Players  Handbook, the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide,  and  the

Monster  Manualas  well  as Races  of  the  Wildto  use

this  adventure  site.  The  information  presented  here

utilizes the D&D v.3.5 rules.

To get started, print out the adventure site, including

the  map.  Read  through  the  material  at  least  once  to

familiarize  yourself  with  the  situation,  site,  and  major

NPCs (particularly their motivations). You must decide

what  kind  of  action  takes  placewhether  the  PCs

simply stumble upon the site or have a reason to visit.

Monster  and  NPC  statistics  are  provided  with  each

encounter area in abbreviated form or, where appropri-

ate, references to entries in the Monster Manual or Races

of the Wild are given.

BACKGROUND

The Rifinti have used this particular cliff dwelling for

many  years,  and  they  are  constantly  maintaining  and

improving it. The flock varies in size from year to year,

but so far, it has never been too large for this home.

The flock has recently taken in a wounded elf named

Hannilac, who fell to an ambush while tracking some

strangers  through  the  wilderness.  The  Rifinti  have

established to their satisfaction that Hannilac presents

no threat to them, but the flock leaders are concerned

about  the  possibility  that  the  attack  on  him  portends

trouble in the nearby elf village, and possibly even for

the flock.

1

THE CLIFF

The Rifinti dwelling lies on the face of a 300-foot-high

cliff that looks out over a snug valley. At the foot of the

cliff is a deep lake nestled in the foothills of the shelter-

ing mountains. Vast mountain lakes provide additional

water, and the nearby alpine forests offer good hunting.

Farther on, the rolling plains of the lowlands spread out

in fertile grandeur.

The  nearest  settlement  of  any  kind  is  Kalandris

Crossing,  a  small  elf  town  with  fewer  than  1,000  resi-

dents. It lies across the lake, about 12 miles away as the

eagle  flies.  In  addition,  a  tribe  of  nomadic  human

barbarians sometimes hunts in the foothills where the

mountains meet the plains.

Rifinti  hunters  and  traders  have  sporadic  contact

with both the town and the nomads, but the raptorans

maintain no official ties with either group. To the elves,

the Rifinti are quaint, distant cousins who live in splen-

did  isolation,  sheltered  from  the  woes  of  the  broader

world.  To  the  humans,  the  Rifinti  are  near-legendary

creatures that occasionally sail down from their moun-

tain  heights  to  converse  with  a  lucky  few  who  know

their ways. In fact, contact between the raptorans and

the  nomads  is  so  infrequent  that  the  human  adept  or

hunter who meets a Rifinti in his youth might not see

another until he is in his dotage.

FEATURES

The Rifinti dwelling occupies the entire south face of

the cliff. The Rifinti use the areas above and below the

cliff  for  stargazing,  debates,  crafting,  weapon  practice,

and other community events. A bit farther to the east,

the Rifinti make charcoal in the forest.

The  main  portion  of  the  dwelling,  which  includes

living space as well as areas used for meetings, worship

and work in inclement weather, is shown on the map

on page 89 in Races of the Wild. The map has also been

reproduced here for convenience.

The  main  dwelling,  a  two-story  structure  set  into  a

natural hollow in the stone, is located 170 feet above the

lakeshore. The ancestors of the present-day Rifinti built

it generations ago with the help of many stone shape and

wall  of  stone spells.  Because  of  the  artistry  used  in  its

construction,  the  whole  structure  blends  seamlessly

into the cliffs natural stone.

Unless otherwise stated in the text for a specific area,

the dwellings major features are as follows.

hand-  and  footholds  for  climbers,  but  the  rock  is  so

badly weathered that it tends to crumble at the slightest

touch,  making  climbing  a  difficult  and  perilous

prospect.  The  statistics  below  represent  the  wall

sections near the dwellings doors and windows.

ss Cliff Face: 5 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 450; Break

DC 43; Climb DC 25.

The interior walls are also made of stone, but theyre

polished to the smoothness of silk.

ss Interior Walls: 5 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 450;

Break DC 43; Climb DC 30.

Ceilings

The ceilings in the Rifinti cliff dwelling are arched in

passages and domed in chambers. Each dome or arch is

at least 20 feet high in the center and 10 feet high where

it  meets  the  walls.  The  lofty  ceilings  are  designed  to

make  the  Rifinti  comfortable  by  providing  plenty  of

open space overhead.

Floors

The  floors  on  both  levels  are  made  of  smooth  stone.

Most  are  bare,  but  a  few  have  loose  coverings  of  furs,

reeds,  or  other  materials,  as  noted  in  the  individual

room descriptions.

Doorways

As with most raptoran structures, the doorways in the

cliff dwelling are about 8 feet high and have a T shape

that  easily  accommodates  raptoran  wings.  A  typical

raptoran doorway has a lower, vertical portion about 5

feet wide and an upper, horizontal portion about 3 feet

tall  and  8  feet  wide.  An  external  doorway  is  also

equipped with a narrow ledge about 2 feet deep to facil-

itate landings and takeoffs when the residents fly in and

out. A typical entrance is shown on the map.

Doors

The  dwelling  has  no  actual  doorsjust  a  few  leather

curtains  hung  up  to  keep  out  drafts.  In  addition,  the

Rifinti  have  constructed  a  few  sturdy,  wooden  parti-

tions that they can use to block the exterior openings

during emergencies. Cut to fit the T-shaped doorways,

these  250-pound  barriers  are  secured  by  driving

wooden  wedges  into  grooves  cut  into  the  doorway.

Propping  up  a  partition  in  a  doorway  and  wedging  it

into place requires a full-round action.

ss Strong Wooden Partitions: 2 in. thick; hard-

ness 5; hp 20; Break DC 25.

Walls

The  dwellings  exterior  walls  are  made  of  natural

stone.  Their  eroded  surfaces  appear  to  offer  plenty  of

Windows

The  dwellings  windows  are  simple  slits  cut  into  the

cliff  wall  to  admit  light.  Each  measures  about  1  foot

2

wide,  6  feet  high,  and  5  feet  deep  and  is  fitted  with

translucent  glass  panes  that  the  Rifinti  make  them-

selves. The glass is none too smooth or clear, but it does

the job. The windows can be removed to let in fresh air

or replaced with strong shutters that are just as sturdy as

the partitions used to block the doorways.

ss Glass Window Panes: 2 in. thick; hardness 1;

hp 4; Break DC 9.

Light

Any  room  with  a  window  or  doorway  leading

outside  has  at  least  shadowy  illumination  (see  page

165 in the Players Handbook) during daylight hours.

Some areas have artificial light sources that provide

additional  illumination,  as  noted  in  the  individual

area descriptions.

RAISING THE ALARM

Though  not  particularly  warlike,  the  Rifinti  have

designed a well-organized defense for their dwelling.

Any indoor disturbance eventually brings most of the

adult members of the flock to the scene of the action.

Unless a particular area description indicates a quicker

response, Rifinti inside the dwelling typically take 12

rounds to fetch their gear before traveling to the scene by

the shortest route. Rifinti outside the dwelling usually

need at least 1 minute to reach it in an emergency.

If an alarm indicates that intruders are already inside

the dwelling, the gliders (see area 7 and Races of the Wild,

page 88) are in charge of gathering the flocks eggs and

young and getting them to the safety of the forest. They

usually need at least 3 rounds to get everyone out and

on their way.

LOWER FLOOR

The lower floor of the cliff dwelling is used primarily

for  communal  activities.  The  following  sections

include  short  descriptions  of  the  major  areas  on  the

lower  level  of  the  dwelling,  which  are  numbered  for

easy reference.

1. Entrances

From  each  of  these  locations,  the  Rifinti  can  unroll  a

rope  ladder  that  extends  170  feet  to  the  lakeshore

below. The ladders are generally unrolled at dusk and

taken up again at dawn. Although its not apparent on

the map, a narrow trail runs along the lakeshore at the

base  of  the  cliff,  giving  easy  access  to  the  bases  of  the

ladders.

ss Rope  Ladder: 1  in.  thick;  hardness  0;  hp  2;

Break DC 23; Climb DC 0.

2. Landing Hall (EL 3 or 5)

By general agreement, adult Rifinti enter the dwelling

here when theyre flying or gliding. The short corridor

leading to the south has the same T shape as a raptoran

doorway  (see  the  Features  section),  so  that  a  flying

Rifinti can keep his wings extended and glide right into

the hall.

The floor in this area is recessed about 6 inches, and

the Rifinti have filled this space with loose sand taken

from  the  lakeshore  to  assure  soft  landings  for  fliers.

Next to each pillar stands a wooden rake, which is used

to smooth the sand in the corridor. Thanks to this thick

covering of sand, a +5 circumstance bonus applies to all

Move Silently checks made while traversing the floor.

By the same token, however, a +5 circumstance bonus

applies to any Spot checks made to locate invisible crea-

tures moving or standing on the floor.

The Rifinti have strung perches about 10 feet above

the floor of this chamber to aid in defense. The perches

run both north to south and east to west.

Creatures: One or two gliders are always on watch

here to guard against unauthorized visitors.

DD Gliders  (12): hp  20  and/or  31;  see  area  7  for

statistics.

Tactics: Though  still  unsure  of  themselves,  the

gliders are eager to prove their mettle. They sit on the

perches and keep a sharp lookout for intruders.

If  they  notice  strangers  roaming  about  unescorted,

they  immediately  demand  that  the  newcomers  lay

down their weapons and spell pouches. Strangers who

comply  are  escorted  out  of  the  dwelling  and  down  to

the  lakeshore,  where  theyre  told  to  await  the

sunspeaker (Elissto Nisian; see area 20).

Should  the  gliders  believe  strangers  to  be  hostile

(quite likely during the spring, or when the sentries at

area  12  have  given  the  alarm,  or  when  the  strangers

dont immediately disarm), the gliders attack to the best

of  their  ability.  Usually,  they  begin  by  launching

ranged  attacks  or  spells  from  their  perches,  jumping

from  perch  to  perch  as  needed  to  maneuver.  If  melee

attacks  seem  in  order,  the  guards  try  to  glide  past  the

foes  front  line  and  engage  the  rear  ranks.  No  matter

what tactics they employ, the gliders shout for help as

soon and as often as they can.

Any disturbance in this chamber brings the raptoran

in charge of the workshops (area 3) running. Likewise,

the guards here notice any disturbances in that area.

3. Workshops (EL 8 or 5)

These  three  chambers  are  furnished  with  sturdy

wooden  benches,  firepits,  and  racks  of  tools  and

3

4

supplies  for  craftwork.  Lamps  fueled  with  oil  that  the

Rifinti have rendered from animal fat provide illumina-

tion around the clock.

The  Rifinti  prefer  to  work  out-of-doors  when  they

can, but since doing so is not always possible or practi-

cal, the flocks crafters use these chambers as needed. At

any given time, the benches in these rooms may hold a

variety of unfinished items, including clothing, baskets,

and  pots.  The  Rifinti  sometimes  use  these  rooms  for

making  bows  and  arrow  shafts  as  well,  but  they  make

their metal weaponry in area 14.

Creatures: Delembril Vintagil, the Rifinti supply

chief,  often  drops  by  the  workshops  to  check  on  any

work in progress. In addition, Inkili, the oldest member

of the flock, spends at least 18 hours a day here blowing

glass or just puttering around. The elderly glassblower

sleeps  poorly  because  of  his  aches  and  pains,  so  he

arrives  well  before  sunset  and  usually  doesnt  leave

until after dawn.

DD Delembril Vintagil: hp  42,  see Races  of  the

Wild, page 8586.

DD Inkili: Male raptoran warrior 2/expert 4; CR 5;

Medium humanoid; HD 2d8+2 plus 4d6+4; hp 33; Init

+2; Spd 30 ft., fly 40 ft. (average); AC 16, touch 13, flat-

light vision, raptoran traits; AL NG; SV Fort +5, Ref +3,

Will +5; Str 10, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 16, Wis 13, Cha 9.

Skills  and  Feats: Appraise  +5  (+7  when  appraising

glass,  leather,  or  metal  items),  Climb  +6,  Craft  (glass-

blowing) +12, Craft (leatherworking) +9, Craft (metal-

working) +9, Handle Animal +3, Jump +14, Knowledge

(local) +6, Listen +6, Search +6, Spot +10, Survival +3;

Alertness,  Blind-Fight,  Weapon  Focus  (composite

longbow).

Languages: Common, Elven, Sylvan, Tuilvilanuue.

Raptoran Traits: Inkili takes only 1d6 points of

damage  from  a  fall  of  any  height.  He  has  an  unerring

sense  of  direction  and  always  knows  which  way  is

north.  Inkili  can  use  his  wings  to  glide,  negating  any

damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of

horizontal travel for every 5 feet of descent. Even if his

maneuverability  improves,  he  cant  hover  while  glid-

ing,  and  he  cant  glide  while  carrying  a  medium  or

heavy load. Inkili can fly for 1 round at no penalty, or

for  2  rounds  at  the  cost  of  becoming  fatigued.  While

flying, he can make a dive attack (as a charge, but must

fly  at  least  30  feet,  descend  at  least  10  feet,  and  use  a

piercing weapon to deal double damage on a hit).

Possessions: Masterwork studded leather armor, ring of

protection +1, masterwork dagger, masterwork composite

longbow with 20 arrows, universal solvent, potion of bears

endurance, 2 potions of cure light wounds, 2 tanglefoot bags.

Tactics: Both  Delembril  and  Inkili  react  to

strangers in much the same way as the guards in area 2

do, though theyre much calmer about the prospect of

repelling  intruders.  Both  fight  from  aloft  as  much  as

they can and loudly shout for help. Delembril uses hold

person on  a  fighter-type,  followed  by  silence against  a

spellcaster  or  a  melee  attack  against  a  likely  target.

Inkili  lobs  a  tanglefoot  bag  at  the  closest  foe,  then

shoots arrow at whichever foe appears most dangerous.

Development: Anyone  in  this  chamber  notices

disturbances in area 2 right away, and vice versa.

4. Kitchen (EL 08)

Food  of  some  sort  is  always  cooking  in  this  chamber,

filling the room with delicious smells. A pair of ovens

and  a  stone  hearth,  all  wood-fired,  provide  plenty  of

space for frying, broiling, and simmering food. In addi-

tion, the Rifinti often fill the three pits in the floor with

embers from their fires, then bury clay pots of food in

them to cook slowly.

Creatures: All  the  Rifinti  except  unfledged

infants use the kitchen from time to time. During the

night, at least one member of the flock is usually here

cooking for his extended family at any given time, and

the  chef  moves  in  and  out  during  the  day,  tending

whatever dishes she has in progress. At mealtimes, six

or seven cooks may be working in here at once.

Raptorans  (07): See  Races  of  the  Wild, page  68

(racial  traits),  page  88  (other  flock  members),  and

160162 (raptoran NPCs) for statistics.

5. Pantries

These  two  rooms  are  storage  areas  for  foodstuffs  and

herbs. Baskets and clay jars are stacked on the floors and

crammed into niches in the walls, and bunches of dried

fruits  and  mesh  bags  stuffed  with  dried  or  smoked

meats hang from the ceilings.

The  Rifinti  have  caches  of  food  (usually  buried  in

stone-lined  pits)  all  over  the  countryside  around  the

cliff dwelling, but they also keep a few supplies near the

kitchen for convenience. In an emergency, the Rifinti

can survive on the food stored in these pantries (and in

area 18) for several weeks.

6. Aviary (EL 5 or 6)

The Rifinti use this chamber to house some of their avian

allies. The air smells slightly musty, thanks to the birds

feathers and the moldering scraps from their past meals.

5

In  the  northern  portion  of  the  chamber  stand  six

pedestals, each about 5 feet high and topped with a plat-

form  about  3  feet  square.  Poles  about  6  feet  high  rise

from the southeast and northwest corners of each plat-

form, ending in sturdy perches.

The chambers south section is open, and a vertical

shaft leads upward 15 feet from its ceiling to area 20. A

wickerwork  liner  inside  the  shaft  facilitates  climbing

(Climb DC 15). Any creature with clawed appendages

(including a raptoran) gains a +10 circumstance bonus

on Climb checks inside the shaft.

The  floor  is  covered  with  a  mixture  of  twigs,  pine

needles,  herbs,  and  moss  that  absorbs  the  birds  drop-

pings and food scraps. The Rifinti sweep up the whole

mess several times a week and dump it in the forest. A

patch of edible mushrooms grows on the dumpsite, and

the Rifinti particularly relish these.

Creatures: Two  mated  pairs  of  giant  owls  and

two  dire  hawks  call  this  chamber  home,  and

Lightning  (Jenlisa  Iltingers  dire  hawk  animal

companion)  is  sometimes  here  as  well.  During  the

day,  Lightning  is  in  area  8a  with  his  master,  but  at

night  hes  here  about  50%  of  the  time  and  with

Jenlisa the rest of the time.

DD Giant Owls (4): hp 26 each; see Monster Manual,

page 205.

DD Dire  Hawks  (2): hp  32  each;  see Races  of  the

Wild, page 189.

DD Lightning: hp 71; see Races of the Wild, page 83.

Tactics: The  birds  in  this  chamber  dont  care  for

visitors,  and  they  wont  tolerate  intrusions  by  non-

raptorans  unless  Jenlisa,  Henesku,  Chanil,  or  Miithi

accompanies them.

In a fight, the two dire hawks fly at the closest foe,

clawing and biting. They are perfectly willing to fight to

the death to defend their roosting place.

The  giant  owls  are  cagey  enough  to  pick  out

dangerous foes, such as spellcasters, and attack them

first. The aviary is a little cramped for combat on the

wing,  but  the  owls  can  maneuver  by  hopping

between the perches and platforms. If reduced to 10

or  fewer  hit  points,  they  withdraw,  exiting  via  the

doorways  to  the  east  or  west,  or  through  the  shaft

leading  to  area  20whichever  route  proves  faster

and safer.

If Lightning is present, he joins the owls in attacking

spellcasters  or  other  potent  foes.  He  fights  until  the

owls flee or until any bird is killed, then withdraws to

find Jenlisa.

Development: In a fight, the birds in this chamber

screech  so  loudly  that  every  other  creature  in  the

dwelling can hear them. The noise brings the guards from

area  2,  plus  any  Rifinti  in  area  7,  in  2  rounds.  Rifinti

anywhere else in the dwelling take 3 to 4 rounds to arrive.

7. Great Hall (EL 6)

Most  of  the  Rifinti  prefer  the  great  hall  to  any  other

room  in  the  whole  dwelling.  Benches  line  the  walls

here,  and  perches  run  between  the  pillars  both  north

and south. When the chamber is in use, oil lamps simi-

lar to the one in area 3 are mounted in sconces on each

of  the  chambers  twelve  pillars.  During  cold  weather,

the Rifinti bring in massive clay urns filled with glow-

ing charcoal to provide heat.

The  Rifinti  gather  here  to  pursue  their  favorite

pastimes: storytelling and debate. They hold a commu-

nal debate whenever any kind of issuebe it important

or trivialfaces the community. They also meet here to

tell  stories  once  in  awhile  for  variety.  During  any

communal  gathering,  junior  Rifinti  (flock  members

who  have  not  yet  completed  the  Walk  of  the  Four

Winds)  sit  on  the  benches,  and  the  senior  members

occupy the perches.

Creatures: Most hours of the day, the hall stands

empty, except perhaps for three or four gliders (young-

sters who are approaching adulthood but have not yet

gone on the Walk of the Four Winds). They have a little

time on their hands because theyve mastered most of

their lessons, but they dont yet have adult responsibili-

ties.  So  they  gather  here  to  share  their  apprehensions

about their coming ordeals. Statistics for a few typical

gliders are given below.

Evasion  (Ex): If  Naefidrim  is  exposed  to

any effect that normally allows her to attempt a

Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no

damage with a successful saving throw.

Animal Companion Benefits (Ex): Claneari

and Naefidrim enjoy the link and share spells special

qualities.

Link  (Ex): Claneari  can  handle  Naefidrim  as  a  free

action.  She  also  gains  a  +4  circumstance  bonus  on  all

wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made

regarding her owl.

spell with a target of You on her animal companion.

Raptoran Traits: Claneari takes only 1d6 points

of damage from a fall of any height. She has an unerring

sense  of  direction  and  always  knows  which  way  is

north. Claneari can use her wings to glide, negating any

damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of

horizontal travel for every 5 feet of descent. Even if her

natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.

Woodland  Stride  (Ex): Claneari  may  move

through  natural  thorns,  briars,  overgrown  areas,  and

similar terrain at her normal speed and without damage

or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and over-

grown areas that are magically manipulated to impede

motion still affect her.

Tactics: The  gliders  in  here  use  the  tactics

described in area 2 to fight any intruders.

Development: Anyone  in  the  Great  Hall  reacts

instantly to disturbances in areas 8 or 10, and vice versa.

8. Nests (EL Varies)

These  small  chambers  serve  as  living  quarters  for  the

Rifinti. Each room is home to a family, which consists

of either a mating pair or a group of age-mates who have

chosen  to  bunk  together  for  a  season,  plus  fledglings

and gliders currently under the adults supervision.

Each  nest  chamber  contains  a  low  table,  several

baskets  for  storing  belongings,  and  a  few  chairs  and

stools. To the left and right of each entrance are twelve

bunks,  arranged  in  two  double  banks  stacked  three

high. Each bunk consists of a wooden frame with hide

stretched loosely over it to form a sort of hammock. The

Rifinti  tend  to  sleep  in  the  upper  bunks  and  use  the

lower ones for perching or extra storage.

A  few  of  these  nests  (8c8f)  include  vertical  shafts

just like the one in the aviary (area 6). The shafts lead up

to the nurseries (area 17) on the upper floor. Chambers

with shafts are occupied exclusively by mated couples.

Creatures: All  forty-one  adult  Rifinti  sleep  in

these  chambers,  along  with  a  varying  number  of  chil-

dren  and  fledglings.  Exactly  who  sleeps  where  varies

with the season and the current mood of the flock.

During the day, almost the whole flock is here sleep-

ing  except  for  the  sentries  in  areas  2,  10,  12,  and  20.

Inkili, however, tends to work nearly around the clock

in area 3. Elissto Nisian, the sunspeaker, stays on duty

in area 20 during daylight, along with a few gliders who

are too restless to sleep.

At  night,  one  or  two  Rifinti  chiefs  may  be  here

enjoying a quiet moment. At any given time, a restless

glider or two might be found here as well (see area 7 for

statistics).

Rifinti (41): See Races of the Wild, pages 8290 for

the Rifintis statistics.

9. Ramps

Each of these corridors slopes up 35 feet to the upper

floor. The pitch is very steep, requiring a DC 5 Climb

check to ascend.

10. Watchpost (EL 3 or 5)

Flanking  the  exits  of  this  round  chamber  are  perches

similar to the ones in area 2. A shaft just like the one in

area 6 leads up to area 22.

Creatures: One or two gliders are posted here to

keep an eye on the entrances nearby.

DD Gliders (12): hp 20 and/or 31; see area 7 for

statistics.

Tactics: The guards here use the tactics noted in area 2.

11. Chapel (EL 4 or 8)

This chamber serves as the chapel for the Rifinti. Read

or paraphrase the following when the PCs enter.

The vaulted ceiling of the main chamber has been

painted  to  resemble  a  glorious  sunset,  with  vari-

colored  clouds  and  a  purple  sun  sinking  in  the

west. But although the walls are fantastically deco-

rated,  the  room  is  completely  devoid  of  furnish-

ings.  The  alcove  to  the  south  is  decorated  with

frescoes showing a winged humanoid female with

clawed feet chasing a great boar and other scenes

depicting similar beings.

The  winged  female  in  the  south  alcove  is  Tuilviel

Glithien,  and  the  raptorans  depicted  in  the  other

images  are  also  raptoran  deities  (see Races  of  the  Wild,

pages 7680). The windows in the alcove provide light

during  the  day,  and  two everburning  torches illuminate

the  chapel  at  night.  The  Rifinti  do  not  clutter  their

chapel  with  furniture  or  even  perches  because  they

favor  simple  worship  and  feel  that  a  pleasant  atmos-

phere is the only necessary element.

8

Creatures: A cleric is always on duty here. The star

chief  (Jantril  Sestriin)  rotates  8-hour  shifts  with  two

glider clerics. The attendant can help fellow Rifinti with

their devotions but is primarily here to keep an eye on

the west entrance, just in case someone tries to sneak in.

DD Jantril  Sestriin: hp  54,  see  Races  of  the  Wild,

pages 87 and 126.

DD Thodreire  or  Solhareth: Female  raptoran

New spell described in Chapter 7 in Races of the Wild.

Languages: Common, Tuilvilanuue.

Raptoran Traits: Either  cleric  takes  only  1d6

points of damage from a fall of any height. She has an

unerring  sense  of  direction  and  always  knows  which

way is north. She can use her wings to glide, negating

any  damage  from  a  fall  of  any  height  and  allowing  20

feet of horizontal travel for every 5 feet of descent. Even

if her maneuverability improves, she cant hover while

gliding, and she cant glide while carrying a medium or

heavy load. Thodreire or Solhareth can fly for 1 round

at no penalty, or for 2 rounds at the cost of becoming

fatigued.

Cleric Spells Prepared (caster level 4th): 0cure minor

wounds, detect magic, light, mending, virtue; 1stbless, cause

fear (DC 14), command (DC 14), raptors sight*, shield of

faith;  2ndaid,  augury,  spiritual  weapon (+6  melee),

summon dire hawk*.

Sky  (fly  speed  or  glide  speed  improves  by  +5  feet),

Protection (protective ward 1/day).

shield,  masterwork  heavy  mace,  masterwork  light

crossbow  with  20  bolts,  2  scrolls  of  cure  light  wounds,

scroll of invisibility purge, wand of sound burst (8 charges).

Tactics: The attendant in this chamber uses much

the same tactics as the guards in area 2 do, except that

an effort is made to draw intruders toward area 10 (and

away from the corridor leading to the nests). Thodreire

or  Solhareth  uses  sound  burst or spiritual  weapon,  then

summons a dire hawk. Jantril casts ice storm, then uses

her  footbow.  She  may  also  try  to  lure  foes  outside  so

that she can use call lightning.

UPPER FLOOR

The  chambers  on  this  floor  are  generally  reserved  for

storage or private pursuits.

12. Sentry Posts (EL 8)

The perches set into this portion of the cliff face offer

an excellent view of the cliff and the lakeshore below.

The Rifinti love to sit up here and enjoy the breeze.

Between each pair of perches is a slit with a shallow

alcove behind it. These alcoves, which are not shown on

the map, offer the sentries posted here some protection

from the elements as well as a degree of cover.

Creatures: Each sentry post is manned around the

clock  by  a  Rifinti  ranger  and  a  Rifinti  rogue,  both  of

whom hunker down in the alcoves. Each sentry stands

a  12-hour  shift,  but  the  ranger  and  the  rogue  stagger

their watches so that only one of them is going off duty

at a time.

ranger  and  his  owl  enjoy  the  link  and  share  spells

special qualities.

way  is  north.  He  can  use  his  wings  to  glide,  negating

Languages: Common, Elven, Sylvan, Tuilvilanuue.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex): Each  rogue  deals  3d6  extra

points of damage on any successful attack against flat-

footed  or  flanked  targets,  or  against  a  target  that  has

been  denied  its  Dexterity  bonus  for  any  reason.  This

damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up

to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune

to  extra  damage  from  critical  hits  are  all  immune  to

sneak  attacks.  The  rogue  may  choose  to  deliver

nonlethal  damage  with  his  sneak  attacks,  but  only

when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such

as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion (Ex): If Eiraliam or Cyirevia is exposed to

any effect that normally allows him to attempt a Reflex

saving throw for half damage, he takes no damage with

a successful saving throw.

Raptoran  Traits:  Each  rogue  takes  only  1d6

points of damage from a fall of any height. He has an

unerring  sense  of  direction  and  always  knows  which

way  is  north.  He  can  use  his  wings  to  glide,  negating

any  damage  from  a  fall  of  any  height  and  allowing  20

feet of horizontal travel for every 5 feet of descent. Even

if  his  maneuverability  improves,  he  cant  hover  while

gliding, and he cant glide while carrying a medium or

heavy load. Each rogue can fly for 1 round at no penalty,

or for 2 rounds at the cost of becoming fatigued. While

flying, he can make a dive attack (as a charge, but must

fly  at  least  30  feet,  descend  at  least  10  feet,  and  use  a

piercing weapon to deal double damage on a hit).

Trapfinding  (Ex): Each  rogue  can  find,  disarm,

or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use

the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to

disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used

to  create  it).  If  his  Disable  Device  result  exceeds  the

traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the

trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): Each  rogue  retains  his

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed

or targeted by an unseen foe (he still loses his Dexterity

bonuses if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).

Possessions: Masterwork  studded  leather  armor,

masterwork  short  sword,  +1  shortbow with  20  arrows,

10

cloak of elvenkind, oil of magic weapon, 2 potions of cure light

wounds, potion of shield of faith (+2).

Tactics: The  sentries  have  cover  in  their  niches,

and they try to stay hidden because they believe that

unnoticed  guards  are  more  effective  that  obvious

ones.  All  the  sentries  take  10  on  their  Hide  checks,

and each gets a +2 bonus for the time and effort spent

in concealment.

All the sentries are contrariesraptorans trained to

say  the  opposite  of  what  they  mean.  If  they  note

strangers approaching, the ranger speaks up: Welcome

travelers!  What  brings  you  to  visit  the  Rifinti?  This

greeting means that the visitors arent welcome at all. If

they seem willing to talk, however, the ranger whistles

for Elissto Nisian, the sunspeaker. He arrives from area

20 in 2 rounds and takes over the negotiations.

If strangers attack or try to enter the cliff dwelling

without  Elisstos  invitation,  the  sentries  attack.  The

ranger leaps off the cliff and fires his footbow until he

runs out of +2 arrows. Then he dives to the attack, using

his rapier, and sends his owl to harass enemy spellcast-

ers while he fights. The rogue stays hidden for as long

as  is  practical.  He  tries  to  begin  with  a  sneak  attack  if

possiblemost likely with a bow. Thereafter, he keeps

firing until the ranger engages in melee, then joins in

the melee attack, trying to work his way into position

for more sneak attacks.

13. Armory

Chanil  Akiilin,  the  Rifinti  war  chief,  has  laid  in  a  big

supply  of  armor  and  weapons  in  this  chamber.  Long

racks hold swords, bows, foot spikes, bucklers, shields,

and several kinds of armor.

Treasure:  Among  the  arms  collected  here  are  3

pairs  of  masterwork  raptoran  foot  spikes,  5  suits  of

masterwork  studded  leather,  5  suits  of  wildwood

banded  mail,  3  wildwood  chain  shirts,  a  suit  of  wild-

wood half-plate, and a mithral chain shirt.

14. Smithy

This chamber resembles the workshops at area 3, except

that  it  contains  a  furnace  equipped  with  two  massive

bellows, two anvils, and three troughs full of oily water.

A  collection  of  hammers,  punches,  files,  and  other

metalworking tools rounds out the equipment here.

Currently,  the  smithy  is  empty  and  quiet.  The

Rifinti  metalsmiths  have  been  working  hard,  but

theyve  run  out  of  charcoal.  Chanil  Akiilin  is  pressing

for  more  fuel  to  keep  up  weapon  production,  but

Delembril  Vintagil,  the  supply  chief,  has  put  her  foot

down (see Races of the Wild, pages 85 [Chanil] and 8586

[Delembril]).

15. Playroom

This room looks like a smaller version of the great hall

(area 7). The Rifinti children gather and play here on a

regular basis. The chamber also doubles as a classroom.

16. Guest Room (EL 2)

The  guest  room  was  just  another  nest  until  recently,

and it still has a nests furnishings (see area 8). Not long

ago, however, Rifinti scouts discovered a wounded elf

in the forest near the cliff dwelling. He had been badly

mauled, and his life was literally hanging by a thread.

The  Rifinti  have  made  their  guest  comfortable  in

this room and bidden him stay until hes strong enough

to leave. Henesku Finlist, the medicine chief, has been

tending  his  wounds,  and  Jenlisa  Iltinger,  the  flock

chief, has been gently questioning him about his ordeal.

Hannilac lives in Kalandris Crossing.

Several days ago, he and several friends were return-

ing  from  a  hunt  when  they  spotted  several  figures

slipping furtively out of town.

Hannilac and his friends abandoned their game and

tried  to  shadow  the  strangers.  The  group  led  them

right into Rifinti territory.

Shortly thereafter, the strangers suddenly turned and

attacked  Hannilac  and  his  friends,  and  something

else hit them from behind.

Hannilac went down under a hail of arrows and dragged

himself into the brush. He blacked out after that.

The  Rifinti  cant  add  much  to  his  story.  Their  scouts

found  numerous  arrows  of  elven  make  on  the  scene.

Because  of  the  sheer  number  of  footprints,  their

rangers  couldnt  get  a  clear  picture  of  what  had

happened to Hannilac, other than the fact that he had

been expertly ambushed.

Should the PCs wish to pursue this plotline, its up to

you as DM to decide what was really going on. Perhaps

the  strangers  were  infiltrators  (drow  or  other  evil

humanoids)  reconnoitering  the  town,  or  perhaps  an

agent  of  evil  is  at  work  in  Kalandris  Crossing.  Jantril

Sestriin already half-suspects that the latter possibility

is true (see Races of the Wild, page 87 and 126).

17. Nurseries

These  chambers  serve  as  incubators  for  the  Rifintis

eggs and snug homes for the fledglings. The walls are

lined  with  perches  about  waist  high  to  an  adult

raptoran.  Below  the  perches  are  narrow  shelves  piled

with downy moss, dry grass, and bits of fur.

18. Granary

The Rifinti keep baskets full of seeds and nuts piled in

this chamber, along with a flat stone for grinding meal

and flour. A few pounds of finished flour are stored in

bags hanging from the ceiling.

19. Gallery

A hidden shaft in the ceiling of this chamber admits

moonlight for a liessit display (see page 71 in Races of

the  Wild).  At  night,  the  room  is  alive  with  cool

colors  that  shift  ever  so  subtly  while  the  moon

crosses the sky.

During the day, the Rifinti keep the shaft closed, so

the chamber stays fairly dark. A few shelves and niches

here  and  there  hold  small  sculptures  finished  with

phosphorescent paint (which provide some light), plus

an assortment of artistically made glassware.

Treasure: The  liessit display  is  a  true  work  of  art,

but  it  cant  be  removed  from  the  chamber  without

destroying  it.  However,  the  glassware  and  sculptures

are  of  some  value.  The  collection  includes  three  stat-

uettes worth 25 gp each and seven pieces of glassware

worth 50 gp each.

20. Sunspeakers Chamber (EL 8)

This  chamber  is  similar  to  the  aviary  (area  6),  except

that  it  has  only  one  perch,  and  the  shaft  in  the  north

end leads down to area 6.

Creatures: Elissto Nisian, the sunspeaker, is here

during daylight hours. He is always ready to speak for

the Rifinti should any diurnal visitors arrive.

DD Elissto  Nisian: hp  22,  see  Races  of  the  Wild,

page 8788.

Tactics: Elissto would rather talk than fight, but he

puts  the  flocks  safety  over  all  other  concerns.  Hes  a

skilled  negotiator,  but  hes  also  a  contrary.  Like  the

raptorans in area 3, Elissto demands immediate surren-

der from any unescorted strangers he encounters inside

the  cliff  dwelling.  If  the  PCs  approach  the  dwelling

openly, however, they probably wont encounter Elissto

until the sentries at area 12 call for him.

In  any  case,  Elissto  plays  the  contrary  when  he

greets  strangers  outside  the  dwelling.  Read  or  para-

phrase the following in such cases.

Hail  travelers,  I  am  most  pleased  to  see  you;  to

leave, you must ascend with me.

This speech means that hes not terribly pleased to see

the  strangers,  but  if  they  wish  to  stay,  they  must

descend to the lakeshore, away from the dwelling.

After giving this greeting, Elissto glides downward.

If  the  visitors  dont  follow  him,  Elissto  reverses  direc-

tion and addresses them as follows.

Go! Your  welcome  becomes  new.  Ascend  now!

The guards will not shoot if you dont stay here!

In this case, Elissto means that the guards will shoot if

the visitors linger. In fact, the Sunspeaker will be happy

if  visitors  move  away  from  the  dwelling,  either  up  or

down the cliff.

Development: A  DC  10  Sense  Motive  check

reveals  the  true  gist  of  Elisstos  speech,  and  a  DC  15

Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (geography) reminds

a  character  of  the  existence  and  general  nature  of

12

raptoran contraries. If visitors can establish communi-

cations and obey the true meaning of his instructions,

Elissto proves charming and helpful. He can extend the

PCs  permission  to  visit  Rifinti  territory  and  answer

questions abut the lay of the land. In the summer, fall,

or  winter,  he  might  even  invite  polite  visitors  inside,

though he flatly refuses to admit anyone in the spring.

If violence erupts, Elissto tries to fascinate the most

dangerous-looking  or  troublesome  character,  then

makes a suggestion designed to render that opponent less

dangerous,  such  as  Throw  all  your  weapons  in  the

lake. (Elissto knows better than to use contrary speech

when making a magical suggestion). Thereafter, he casts

haste on himself and his allies, then uses inspire courage

and joins the fray himselfprobably by attacking with

his footbow.

21. Upper Aviary

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs enter.

Continuous rows of perches and nesting boxes in

various sizes line the walls from floor to ceiling. In

the  domed  portion  of  the  ceiling,  perches  criss-

cross  the  open  space.  The  chamber  echoes  with

avian cries.

The Rifinti keep birds of all kinds in this room, and the

air is thick with loose feathers. To keep the place clean,

the Rifinti keep the floor covered with litter similar to

that in area 6.

Creatures:  In  this  chamber,  the  Rifinti  keep

chickens and ducks for meat and eggs, pigeons for long-

distance communications, and a pair of chordevocs that

Elissto obtained from a band of halflings.

DD Chordevocs (2): hp 5 each; see Races of the Wild,

page 188.

Tactics: The  chordevocs  arent  exactly  tame,  but

theyve  learned  to  tolerate  the  Rifinti.  They  attack

anyone  or  anything  else  that  enters,  including

raptorans from other flocks.

22. Upper Landing Stage (EL 5)

This  area  is  similar  to  area  2,  but  much  smaller.  The

shaft in the floor leads to area 10.

Creatures: One or two gliders are always on watch

here.

DD Gliders (12): hp 16 and/or 27; see area 7 for

statistics.

Tactics:  The  gliders  try  to  remain  out  of  sight  in

the two alcoves. If combat ensues, they use the tactics

described in area 2.
