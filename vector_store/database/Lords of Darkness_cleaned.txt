This  book  presents  the  most  important  and  in-

triguing agencies of evil in Faern, along with in-

formation  about  how  to  use  them  in  your

campaign. Perplex your players with a murder perpetrated by

the  famed  group  of  assassins  called  the  Night  Masks.  Draw

your player characters into courtly intrigue and involve them

in negotiations with the sharp-eyed, bald, and tattooed Red Wiz-

ards of Thay. Whatever path your campaign takes, you can use

these antagonists to challenge your players and their characters.

No roleplaying game would be complete without enemies,

and  Faern  has  a  plethora  of  them.  Take  the  basics  pre-

sented  in  this  book  and  build  your  campaign  around  them.

Give your antagonists depth and breadth. Allow them some

personality.  Let  them  care.  Good  villains  are  no  less  right

and  justified  in  their  actions  than  the  heroesfrom  their

point of view. Treat each villain as the protagonist of his or

her own story, and not simply antagonists that confront the

heroes at dramatically appropriate points.

How to Use This Book

This book has three principal parts. The first chapter, Major

Organizations,  discusses  seven  primary  organizations  in

Faern. Each entry details various aspects of these organiza-

tions, offers sample encounter groupings, and presents a loca-

tion important to that particular group. The actions of these

groups have effects that ripple through all of Faern.

The  second  chapter,  Minor  Organizations,  describes  a

number of less powerful or smaller organizations. The villains

in this chapter may prove more accessible to heroes than those

in  the  first  chapter,  or  there  may  simply  be  fewer  of  them.

They range in power from extensive thieves guilds to shape-

changers of terrifying lethality.

An  appendix  at  the  end  compiles  all  the  new  feats,  magic

items, and spells noted in the book. Just as player characters

create new spells and weapons with which to combat their foes,

so  too  do  evil  organizations  construct  items  and  magic  to

defend their interests.

ALIGNMENT

Most of the organizations described in this book have evil in-

tentions,  and  the  majority  of  their  members  share  that  evil

alignment.  This  may  not  always  be  the  case,  however,  since

there are exceptions to every rule. Sometimes good people do

bad things for good reasons. You, the DM, must determine the

alignments  of  your  NPC  antagonists  and  establish  their  mo-

tives for the things they do.

Something makes the members of these groups commit evil

deeds.  Theyve  undoubtedly  done  despicable  things,  though

they may have done them in the name of justice, love, or igno-

rance. Maybe they simply lashed out like injured animals and

then couldnt escape the mess they made. Did they choose an

evil path, or end up there through accident or bad choices? Can

your  heroes  help  them  change  their  ways?  Was  one  of  your

heroes responsible for the antagonists downfall? By determin-

ing these facts in advance, you can create complex antagonists

that add roleplaying flavor to your game.

ATTITUDE AND ABILITIES

What  kind  of  antagonists  do  you  want  in  your  campaign?

There are as many models for villains as there are for heroes.

Some  openly  and  obviously  follow  an  evil  agenda,  shrieking

curses  and  causing  bloody  mayhem  as  they  storm  the

fortresses of good. Some sit back, gather their followers, and

wait with eternal patience for the perfect moment to strike.

Within the organizations described in this book, individuals

in  the  actual  membership  vary  greatly.  They  have  different

motivations,  philosophies,  and  personalities.  The  leader  may

not want the same thing as a new initiate. Their priorities un-

doubtedly differ. One may be smart while the other can barely

put  on  his  armor  without  help.  Cookie-cutter  villains  may

speed combat, but they wont surprise and delight your players

as much as unique personalities will.

Introduction

CAMEO OR MASTERMIND?

You  can  keep  your  campaign  straightforward  by  presenting

your  players  with  one  encounter  after  another,  each  unique

and isolated. Or, you can increase the complexity by introduc-

ing antagonists with history, personality, goals, and desires.

Cameo  Appearance.  Chance  encounters  happen  as  part  of

the  adventuring  experience.  The  one-shot  conflict  occurs  at

any time, in any environment. The heroes surprise one of the

Shadow Thieves in the middle of an assassination attempt, or

they meet a Red Wizard while negotiating the sale of a magic

item  they  salvaged  from  a  dungeon.  In  these  instances,  the

heroes  have  no  preexisting  connection  to  the  antagonist  and

will likely never see the villain again.

Recurring  Thread. You  can  give  an  antagonist  long-term

utility. Over the scope of your campaign, build a saga of grand

proportions by having your villain grow as your player charac-

ters do. Your players will love having (and dread meeting) an

antagonist  who  appears  again  and  again,  especially  if  they

know theyre interfering with that antagonists evil plans.

Nemesis.  You  dont  get  anywhere  in  Faern  without

making enemies. All successful adventurers risk acquiring a

nemesis.  You  may  wish  to  draw  the  recurring  antagonist

from one of your heroes backgrounds. Villains have parents,

possibly  siblings,  friends,  lovers  and  even  children  of  their

own. Did one of your heroes know the antagonist many years

ago? If the two actually know one another, have developed a

history between them, or have something in common, then

you have the makings for a truly dramatic encounter.

Mastermind. Build the story up as the characters advance in

level. You can add an epic feel to your campaign by having your

heroes face the masterminds minions early in their careers. They

can then face increasingly dangerous followers as they become

stronger, until finally they meet the mastermind himself.

The rest of this introduction explains how the information

in each organization is arranged.

Brief History

The organizations discussed have long histories, sweeping stories

of  intrigue,  backstabbing,  and  carefully  planned  political  coups

that can (and have) filled novels in their detail. This text is an

overview of these histories, which can be embellished as required.

The Organization

This text gives statistical information on the organization at a

glance. In some cases the statistics reflect a specific subgroup

rather than the entire organization, as noted.

Headquarters: The location of the agencys headquarters, if any.

Members: The groups approximate population throughout

the whole of Faern.

Hierarchy: Classification of the general nature of the hier-

archy, which determines various factors as described below.

Leader: The name and title of the leader or leaders.

Religion: The deity or deities commonly worshiped by the

members of the organization, if any.

Alignment: The  overall  alignment  of  the  organiza-

tionwhich does not necessarily apply to all members within

the organization. If multiple alignments are given, the first is

the most common, with the rest listed in decreasing order.

Secrecy: Classification of the level of secrecy of the group,

as described below.

Symbol: A description of the symbol or symbols used by the

organization.

Hierarchy: The way an organization is structured falls into

one of four general categories.

Loose: In  this  type  of  organization,  the  only  constant  is

change. Leaders come and go as easily as the weather changes.

Something other than a charismatic leader keeps this group

working as a unit. Perhaps the members all worship the same

deity, or all share a hatred of one race. Members know their

leaders,  openly  welcome  recruits,  and  usually  rely  on  brawn

rather than brain and on passion rather than premeditation.

Militaristic: This type of organization maintains a strict hier-

archy. Orders come down from the top. Members obey their supe-

riors. Lawful evil groups often use this model for their hierarchy.

The leader could be an individual or a committee, but the highest

level of authority remains isolated from the lesser members.

Segmented: This  type  of  hierarchy  has  pods  or  branches

that function independently of one another. Sometimes these

branches  serve  redundant  purposes,  but  dont  know  about

each other. Other times, the branches may complement one

another and work together closely. Only the highest levels of

the hierarchy know the whole structure. They create hidden

subsidiaries to protect their assets in times of trouble, to di-

versify their contacts, and to maintain their secrecy.

Webbed: A  webbed  hierarchy  has  cells  connected  by  a

single linking thread. A cell could be an individual or a small

group. Members know only other members with whom they

have direct contact. These organizations dont have a clearly

traceable hierarchy. Theyre layered in deep secrecy, and even

those in the highest level of the organization dont know all

their agents.

Secrecy: Since most of these organizations cannot operate

in  the  public  eye  without  fear  of  reprisal,  they  adopt  one  of

four levels of secrecy.

High: Members know only their immediate superiors, un-

derlings, and others they work with frequently. Information

is  passed  through  intermediaries  and  is  often  in  code.  Only

those at the highest levels of authority know the true agenda

of the group, and if multiple people are at this level, they all

may  have  their  own  secret  agenda.  Members  communicate

with outsiders via disguises, aliases, and anonymous messages.

Medium: Members know their superiors and inferiors, one

step up and down the chain of command. Mid-level agents are

usually informed of major plans, or at least how their role af-

fects the plan. Few members are open about their affiliation,

and the lowest-level agents may be unaware that they work for

the organization at all.

Low: Members of the organization know most of the other

members, particularly the leaders. Some effort is made to con-

ceal the identity of important individuals from the common

folk.  Outsiders  know  the  affiliation  of  many  members,  and

some flaunt their relationship and status with the group.

None: The group works entirely in the open and makes

no  efforts  to  conceal  its  agenda,  headquarters,  or  operatives.

Members are easily recognized, and most people are familiar

with the nature of the organization and its ultimate goals.

Motivation and Goals: This section describes the motives

Introduction

and objectives of the organization, along with the typical ac-

tivities used to achieve these goals.

Recruiting: Every organization has its own views on gaining

new  members  and  its  own  methods  for  doing  so.  Some  groups

dont actively recruit but acquire members who want to belong.

Others  send  their  members  out  into  the  world  to  coerce,  con-

vince,  or  capture  their  newest  cohorts.  Some  organizations  use

the term recruit loosely, when they really mean enslave. This

section describes how the organization approaches recruiting.

Allies: A description of famous individuals, groups, faiths,

or creatures that commonly associate with the organization.

Enemies: Famous individuals, organizations, or faiths that

frequently oppose the group.

Encounters

In this section, youll discover the tools needed to incorporate vil-

lainous  agents  from  the  organization  in  your  campaign.  These

tools may include a description of a typical group of travelers, a

breakdown  of  NPC  classes  and  levels  for  a  series  of  encounter

levels, a prestige class, common magical abilities held by mem-

bers, and the strengths and weaknesses of the group in question.

The major organizations have delineated sections as follows.

Sample Groups: A breakdown of encounters by EL.

Combat  and  Tactics:  Notes  on  specific  strategies  and  ten-

dencies of the organizations members in combat.

Strengths  and  Weaknesses:  The  organizations  greatest

assets and shortcomings.

Weapons  and  Equipment: Some  organizations  equip  their

followers  with  specific  items  or  provide  greater  support  for

their missions. This section lists items common to the group in

question  and  gives  equipment  and  feats  possessed  by  typical

members  of  the  organization.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  it

does not include bonus equipment for a character having a pre-

ferred class for his or her home region.

Special  Items  and  Supernatural  Abilities:  Any  extraordi-

nary magic items or powers available to members of the group.

NPCs and prestige classes

Some of the organization descriptions include statistics for non-

player characters associated with that organization. In addition,

some of the entries include new prestige classesthe Spur Lord

(church  of  Cyric),  the  darkmask  (drow),  the  Thayan  knight

(Red  Wizards  of  Thay),  the  Zhentarim  skymage  (the  Zhen-

tarim), and the entropist (House Karanok).

The sample NPC tables cover character levels 1st10th. NPCs

above 10th level tend to be unique individuals requiring custom

attention, and should be created by you with that in mind. You can

use the sample NPCs as a baseline or guide for creating higher-

level  characters.  Because  the  sample  encounters  at  high  En-

counter Levels use NPCs above 10th level, you will need to create

these higher-level characters before you can use those encounters.

Also, three prominent nonplayer characters are highlighted

in NPC Gallery sidebars. Youll get more information about

Artemis Entreri and Sememmon (both originally described in

the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting) as well as full sta-

tistics and a detailed description of the fearsome lich Larloch.

Sample Location

For each of the major organizations and some of the minor

ones, a sample location such as a base or lair is presented with

information on its inhabitants and its role in the greater or-

ganization.  Unique  or  important  creatures  and  characters  at

this location are presented with full statistics blocks.

Some of the organizations presented in this book use mon-

sters from Monstrous Compendium: Monsters of Faern as

allies, slaves, or servants. If you do not have that book, you

might  want  to  substitute  those  monsters  with  an  alterna-

tive creature from the Monster Manual. The following is a

list of these creatures, each paired with a creature or crea-

tures from the Monster Manual that can be used as a sub-

stitute.

Greetings, Ombert. I trust you have our payment?

Yes.  You  have  information  on  who  holds  the  dead  body  of

our slain cleric friend?

Why yes. Yes, I do. Its me. As the man grinned, his fea-

tures  and  clothing  shifted,  revealing  a  haughty  man  of  dusky

features in ceremonial black full plate.

Malark! exclaimed the paladin, drawing her sun blade.

The evil cleric grinned and drew his weapon. It flashed in

the night, bearing the profane symbol of the Cyric and exuding

an  aura  of  true  evil.  My  skull  blade thirsts  for  your  blood.

Now I shall avenge my brothers death at your hands. With his

words, six swordsmen appeared out of thin air and surrounded

the heroes.

The church of Cyric is a fanatical organization devoted to the

deity  of  murder,  treachery,  and  deception.  The  most  devout

followers of the Prince of Lies are willing to give their lives

for their cause, and often do so if they can take others with

them. Worshipers of Cyric include murderers, liars, spies, trai-

tors,  and  assassins  with  no  loyalty  to  anyone  except  them-

selves. Even loyalty to their church is tenuous at best in the

face  of  destruction.  Others  embrace  this  dark  deity  because

they  hope  his  philosophy  of  supremacy  and  power  will  em-

power them as well.

Cyrics church is a large cult with members in every city. Be-

cause  it  is  by  and  large  a  chaotic  organization,  its  members

often  act  independently  or  in  small  groups  with  little  or  no

knowledge  of  each  other,  making  the  church  very  hard  to

combat. Likewise, its members are hard to predict

and  incorrigible  in  their  evil,  some  willing  to

betray  their  fellows  for  their  own  gain,  others

more  likely  to  lie  their  way  through  a  situation

until they can murder their captors and escape.

Brief History

Born to a lower-class woman in Zhentil Keep (pre-

sumed by Cyrics detractors to be a prostitute), the

mortal Cyric never knew his parents and was sold

into slavery after his mother was killed when he was very young.

As a young adult, he fell in with a thieves guild and learned to

This chapter details seven of the largest and most in-

sidious  evil  organizations  in  Faern.  These  power

groups  hold  influence  across  huge  territories  and

manipulate events both through their actions and their oppo-

nents responses to their actions. The presence of the drow in

Cormanthor will affect the Dalelands for years to come, and

the Red Wizards enclaves are creating a new dynamic in cities

around  the  Moonsea  and  beyond.  These  organizations  might

suffer  setbacks  that  delay  the  realization  of  their  goals,  but

their schemes will always have an effect on life in Faern.

The Church of Cyric

The  three  heroes  reached  the  rendezvous  point  without  being

followed. Their contact had not yet arrived, and Dorn was be-

ginning  to  get  nervous.  The  sorcerer  scratched  his  head  and

looked about nervously.

Are they late?

No, replied Ombert, buffing a metal stud on his

leather armor. Were early. Nothing to worry about.

Cease  your  talk,  my  friends,  chided  the

woman  in  full  plate.  Bad  enough  we  have  to

deal  with  these  criminal  contacts  of  yours,  I

shouldnt  have  to  hear  you  babble  on  about  it.  She

gripped  her  holy  symbol  of  Lathander  and

frowned.

I hear someone, whispered the halfling. A few

seconds later, three humans stepped into view, two

wearing  chainmail  and  the  third  only  common  clothing.

Each carried a sheathed longsword. The unarmored one spoke.

The Church of Cyric

fight during his travels. During the Time of Troubles, he rose to

godhood and inherited the divine portfolios of Bane, Bhaal, and

Myrkul, the deities of tyranny, murder, and death. His meteoric

rise from orphan to deity would eventually suffer several dra-

matic plummets before his power stabilized at its current level.

Through  divine  events  he  himself  orchestrated,  Cyric  lost

the portfolio of tyranny to Xvim, much of Myrkuls portfolio

to  Kelemvor,  and  caused  the  destruction  of  Zhentil  Keep,  at

that  time  one  of  the  largest  concentrations  of  his  own  wor-

shipers.  This  weakened  his  power  and  the  authority  of  his

church. He later made the mistake of reading the Cyrinishad, a

magical book of his own creation that caused the reader to be-

lieve that Cyric was the most important being in the universe.

The madness and megalomania this caused weakened him fur-

ther. Since that time he has regained his senses, consolidated

his power, and encouraged a renewed fervor in his church. Bol-

stered by their evil deitys new focus, the Cyricists work harder

than ever to promote his goals.

The Organization

quarters, although several outposts vie for the title.

Headquarters: The church maintains no true central head-

Members: Roughly 12,000 clergy and 250,000 worshipers.

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: Cyric (the deity himself holds power over the entire

church).

Religion: Cyric.

Alignment: CE, NE, CN.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: The  symbol  of  Cyric  is  a  white  jawless  skull  cen-

tered on a black or purple sunburst. He kept this symbol even

though it originated from his ownership of the portfolios of

death and the dead, which he no longer has. Some of his tem-

ples  display  minor  variants  on  the  symbol,  such  as  a  sword

under the skull, flaming eye sockets, or even multiple skulls.

Cyric still has a few worshipers who converted to his church

from Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul when those deities died during

the Time of Troubles. These worshipers use the symbols of their

original deity (an upright black hand on a red shield for Bane, a

skull surrounded by streaming teardrops for Bhaal, and a skull

on an inverted shield bordered by finger bones for Myrkul) or a

combination of the old symbol and Cyrics. Most of these splin-

ter cults have been eliminated or absorbed into larger groups.

The  church  of  Cyric  is  cellular  in  structure,  with  different

groups  of  Cyricists  keeping  their  location  and  agenda  secret

and often even working against each other. These habits stem

from the Dark Suns former period of madness, when he would

give conflicting information to different high priests, causing

them  to  turn  their  temples  against  each  other.  Cyric  has

stopped doing this overtly, but his chaotic nature and the fact

that he embodies lying and intrigue attracts people of similar

character who regularly betray their allies, which makes elimi-

nating the problem difficult.

HIERARCHY

A Cyricist temple is led by the most powerful cleric of Cyric

present (usually the one with the most cleric levels, but some-

times a cleric/blackguard takes this role). The temples hierar-

chy is based on power and personal influence, with the most

charismatic and dominant leaders taking positions of author-

ity.  Regular  turnovers  in  leadership  ensure  that  those  who

manage to stay in power tend to be very paranoid, often con-

trolling their immediate subordinates and allies with magic to

prevent betrayal.

The churchs fractious nature leads to the creation of nu-

merous splinter groups and cults, such as the Flames of the

Dark Sun, an order of assassins devoted to Cyric and based in

the  Cloud  Peaks  Mountains.  The  order  is  allied  with  the

Mountain of Skulls temple in Amn and dedicated to the de-

struction of heretical sects of Cyricists, such as those located

at the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse (described later in

this entry).

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The Cyricists wish to destroy anyone who opposes Cyric, elimi-

nate  rival  churches  (of  their  own  religion  and  others),  kill

those devoted to good, and take over the world. They pursue

these goals with many different methods, sometimes at odds

with  the  plans  of  other  Cyricist  temples.  Some  start  armed

conflicts against temples of other deities. Some quietly assassi-

nate influential beings of good alignment. Some promote ban-

ditry. Some take over guilds and cause economic destruction.

Kidnapping, murder, and espionage are also common activities.

Because of their fragmented and independent nature, the cells

of the church might be plotting just about anything that fur-

thers the cause of the Prince of Lies.

Appearance and Personality

The following are typical personalities and attitudes for cler-

ics of Cyric and those who usually travel with them. These de-

scriptions assume a person of chaotic evil alignment known to

be a worshiper of the Black Sun (instead of being disguised).

Cleric of Cyric: Haughty and menacing, with wild eyes and

a presence that inspires simultaneous distrust and belief.

contemplating  secrets  and  the  lust  to  destroy  those  who

offend them.

Barbarian  of  Cyric: Murderous  and  hot-headed,  with  a

hair-trigger  temper  and  the  thoughts  of  murder  and

mayhem close to the surface.

Fighter  of  Cyric: Bloodthirsty  and  sharp-eyed,  with  the

Sorcerer  of  Cyric:  Angry  and  aggressive,  with  a  habit  of

intent to smite every enemy in sight.

making threatening gestures and comments.

Ranger of Cyric: Feral and cruel, with the posture of an

Wizard  of  Cyric:  Withdrawn  and  aloof,  with  an  air  of

animal that kills for the love of killing.

The Church of Cyric

RECRUITING

The  Cyricists  welcome  new  converts.  They  see  their  deity  as

the one true divine authority, and thus joining Cyrics church

is  the  only  sensible  choice.  Even  defeated  enemies  can  buy

themselves time if they volunteer to convert. However, con-

version to Cyric under such circumstances usually involves tor-

turous  rituals  and  horrible  evil  rites  (including  human

sacrifice) performed by the would-be converts to prove their

devotion,  so  anyone  of  good  alignment  who  uses  such  a  ruse

needs to escape before such events occur or risk a forced align-

ment change.

Some temples recruit people, brainwash them into fanatics,

and then send them on suicide missions. These converts are par-

ticularly dangerous because they have been convinced that their

deaths  advance  the  cause  of  Cyric.  In  their  minds  they  win

either way, since martyrdom brings them favor in the afterlife.

Although the temples have gained many new recruits, be-

cause the church was initially formed of worshipers of three

other deities, Cyric has been known to call for purges to elimi-

nate  heretics.  He  has  done  so  at  least  twice  to  remove  those

with allegiance to Bane (while that deity was dead) and some-

times calls for a purge simply to stir up his followers. Those

who  flee  such  purges  (whether  justified  or  not)  often  start

their own cells and recruit more followers to the cause.

The  church  is  fond  of  disguising  agents  as  benign  parties,

then  having  these  agents  pay  good-aligned  adventurers  large

amounts of magic items (typically scrolls and potions) to un-

dertake a quest. When the quest proves to further the cause of

the church or is an outright evil act, other agents surprise the

adventurers and either slay them or attempt to gently convert

them  to  the  cause  of  Cyric.  These  methods  have  resulted  in

several powerful adventuring companies turning to Cyric.

In addition to the people who revere Cyric out of genuine de-

votion, Cyric has many worshipers who pay him lip service in

the hope of staving off his attention and wrath. The devout of

Cyric look upon these weak-willed folk with contempt, but are

not above taking advantage of these lay worshipers if necessary.

ALLIES

Cyrics church allies itself with monsters that have similar in-

terests  or  creatures  that  are  easily  dominated  or  bribed  into

service.  The  church  is  particularly  fond  of  demons,  undead,

evil humanoids, and chaotic and evil outsiders. In wilder lands

where it has no need to disguise its allies, the church employs

creatures  such  as  athachs,  chimeras,  giants,  hieracosphinxes,

howlers, minotaurs, ogres, ropers, wyverns, and young dragons.

The  following  creatures  from  the  Monsters  of  Faern  acces-

sory are also common allies: banelars (although some zealous

Cyricists  dislike  their  lawful  nature,  the  banelars  are  loyal),

black  unicorns  (only  in  Thay),  dread  warriors,  and  yuan-ti

tainted  ones  (in  Calimshan,  Chult,  Hlondeth,  and  Tashalar).

Some  powerful  clerics  keep  a  high-level  summon  monster or

planar  ally spell  or  scroll  in  reserve  just  in  case  they  need

backup. Most clerics also keep a few skeletons or zombies in

their lair.

The  church  sometimes  supports  cells  of  the  Cult  of  the

Dragon (although this is less frequent since Cyric lost the port-

folio of death), monasteries of the Long Death (again, not as

common since Cyric lost that part of his portfolio) and other

evil organizations on a small scale.

Currently  the  Zhentarim  forces  in  Darkhold  are  in  chaos

due to infighting between followers of Cyric and worshipers of

Bane.  Fzoul  Chembryl  of  Zhentil  Keep  has  encouraged  this

strife by sending unruly members of the Zhentarim or those

who  openly  worship  Cyric  to  this  western  castle,  because  he

sees Darkhold as a place to weed out the weak from his organi-

zation.  His  plan  may  backfire  if  Cyrics  devout  take  charge,

and several cells of Cyricist cultists have been supplying aid to

their comrades in the castle. Should Darkhold turn to Cyric,

the Zhentarim will lose their western arm and Cyric will gain

a large and established military force and fortification in the

Western Heartlands.

Though Cyric is opposed to nearly every other deity, Shar

has been tempting Cyric with the power of the Shadow Weave.

This power would allow his clerics to sever the ties they have

with Mystra to cast their spells, which he finds abhorrent.

The best ally for a single member of the church is an asso-

ciate from a nearby allied temple. If a temple can be convinced

that a particular group (such as a band of heroes) is a threat to

the church or an affront to the holy power of Cyric, a Cyricist

is almost guaranteed assistance from that temple, even if its

only in the form of sanctuary, supplies, and information.

ENEMIES

Because  he  opposes  everything  good  and  considers  all  other

deities either beneath him or rivals for his power, Cyric is an

enemy  of  nearly  every  organized  benevolent  group  and  the

churches of all other deities, including evil ones such as Mask

and Bane. His rivalry with Bane is especially fierce now that the

Black Hand has returned. Cyric also particularly hates Mystra

and Kelemvor and directs his church to eliminate worshipers of

these  deities  at  every  opportunity.  Because  of  these  conflicts,

followers of Cyric rarely work with those of other deities.

The Cyricists oppose the Zhentarim because of the latters

alliance with the Banites, although followers of the Dark Sun

usually dont go out of their way to attack Zhentarim troops

since both groups promote evil.

No group hates the Cyricists more than the Banites. They

consider Cyric a usurper of Banes portfolio, and only the fact

that  Bane  reclaimed  much  of  his  power  from  Cyric  has  pre-

vented an all-out holy war. As it is, Bane sees Cyric as an an-

noying cur who once stole a piece of meat from his table, and

when he finds it convenient Bane will have that cur put down.

The followers of the Black Hand treat the Cyricists in a simi-

lar manner, not going out of their way to find the servants of

the Prince of Lies, but wasting no time slaying them if they

are discovered. The Cyricists are more active in their pursuit of

the Banites, but the feeling is otherwise mutual.

Individual  members  of  the  church  of  Cyric  tend  to  have

many  enemies,  particularly  within  their  own  organization.

Fortunately, these feelings shift quickly at all but the highest

levels of power, so someone who is an enemy one day might

not be one the next.

Because they engage in murder and deceit across the conti-

nent, and because their deity is a foe of every other deity, fol-

lowers of Cyric expect to be opposed by just about anyone that

discovers  their  identity.  Even  followers  of  other  evil  deities

have  been  known  to  interrupt  a  battle  with  heroes  when  a

group of violent Cyricists arrives.

The Church of Cyric

Encounters

Cyricists  prefer  to  travel  alone  or  in  small  groups,  because

larger groups are more difficult to manage (with all the inter-

nal conflict and backstabbing) and likely to draw attention. A

typical encounter with a group of Cyricists is a cleric leader of

at least 2nd level plus a wizard or sorcerer and one or two bar-

barian, fighter, or ranger bodyguards each one level lower than

the  cleric,  all  worshipers  of  Cyric.  Barbarian  bodyguards  are

common in barbarian lands, fighters in civilized lands and on

well-traveled  roads,  and  rangers  in  forested  regions.  If  the

wizard and fighters are powerful enough, they may have levels

in the arcane devotee or divine champion prestige classes. The

wizards  who  work  with  Cyric  rarely  specialize  in  a  school  of

magic, since they lack the discipline to focus on a single school.

Cyricists  encountered  on  the  road  may  be  moving  to  or

from a known temple, preparing to establish a cult cell, in the

middle of a mission of woe, or fleeing persecution elsewhere.

Those founding a cell or fleeing another place are more likely

to be secretive and nonconfrontational toward any they meet,

not wishing to draw attention to themselves. The others dis-

play their allegiance openly and violently challenge any groups

they think they can overcome, or whose destruction they think

would benefit the church.

SAMPLE GROUPS

Clr13 of Cyric), 1 mage (CE human Sor12 or Wiz12), 2 body-

guards (CE human Bbn12, Ftr12, or Rgr12).

COMBAT AND TACTICS

The forces of Cyric are generally too undisciplined to formu-

late consistent group tactics. Each individual tends to act inde-

pendently, trying to balance the desire to slaughter many foes

in the name of Cyric and the fear that ones allies will take ad-

vantage  of  the  distractions  of  combat  to  eliminate  a  rival.

Only  in  the  presence  of  a  powerful  and  respected  leader  are

Cyricists able to coordinate their attacks. This does not mean

they are stupidthey dont interfere with each others attacks

and  take  advantage  of  cooperative  opportunities  when  they

occur, but they rarely enter combat with these plans in mind.

About half of Cyrics clerics use their spells to augment their

physical prowess and attack their foes in melee, while the rest

attack directly with their spells. Both types shout the glories of

the Dark Sun while in combat. The wizards and sorcerers con-

ceal themselves with illusions and defensive magic and attack

suddenly with aggressive and destructive spells. Barbarians use

their  rage  often  and  early,  fighters  focus  on  raw  power  over

tricky  maneuvers,  and  rangers  optimize  their  two-weapon

fighting abilities.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The church of Cyric draws power from its many worshipers,

its magical resources, and its very persuasive and believable

members.  Cyricists  are  unpredictable,  zealous,  and  even

willing to die if it means they can destroy enemies of their

religion  in  the  process.  This  makes  them  very  dangerous

people  to  cross,  and  since  their  deity  is  a  deity  of  illusion,

lies, and murder, anyone who thwarts their plans can expect

multiple  assassination  attempts,  devious  incriminating

Church of Cyric: Tips for the DM

As masters of lies, intrigue, deception, and murder, cultists of

Cyric can pop up anywhere. Even trusted NPCsparticularly

those whose background isnt known too well by the heroes

can  be  replaced  by  masquerading  Cyricists.  These  agents

murder innocents in town, refer heroes to disreputable mer-

chants  or  hirelings,  start  rumors  about  the  heroes  while

theyre out of town, and do their best to make life difficult

for the player characters, destroying any trust between them

and the other townsfolk.

Because they can rarely afford to make their presence pub-

licly  known,  Cyricists  tend  to  take  over  existing  buildings

rather than constructing new edifices. This means that any

strange  building,  abandoned  house,  forgotten  dungeon,  dry

sewer, or nearby cave might become a lair for the followers

of Cyric. Since some of their wizard allies are quite eccentric,

they might operate from a tower where odd magical effects

continually  function,  creating  some  unusual  opportunities

for adventuring.

The Dark Sun seeks the worship of all creatures, so almost

any evil monster with the potential to be a cleric could be a

cleric of Cyric, and those that dont might be allied with a

small cell of cultists. For example, heroes who expect to con-

front a brutish manticore may be surprised when they find

out the manticore is the ally of a Cyricist ranger and his bar-

barian friends.

The church also provides raise dead and healing spells for

evil monsters it is trying to convert or that are already in its

service. This benefit tends to cement the monsters loyalty to

the church and makes certain creatures a recurring thorn in

the side of local heroes.

The Church of Cyric

rumors, and haunting images in dreams and the waking world.

The greatest weakness of the church is its fractious and dis-

trustful nature. Its low-level followers tend to be unruly and

argumentative. Its agents in the middle ranks of its hierarchy

distrust  the  leaders,  exploit  the  grunt  followers,  and  plot

against each other. The leaders of the church are even worse

than  the  mid-rank  members,  and  different  temples  to  the

Dark Sun have holy wars against each other as often as they do

against bastions of good such as Lathander and Torm. Some-

times the best way to defeat a group of Cyricists is to alert an-

other group of Cyricists to its presence.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Because  of  their  dependence  upon  stealth  and  their  predilec-

tion for egregious murder, clerics of Cyric tend to have differ-

ent  equipment  than  the  standard  equipment  presented  for

NPC clerics in Chapter 2 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Any regional equipment from having a preferred class  should

be added to that given below. The feat progressions do not in-

clude bonus feats for humans or strongheart halflings. Some

characters may vary from the listing by having regional feats.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND

SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES

The church of Cyric invented the magical skull blade and is

the primary user of such weapons. Cyric or the deities whose

power he inherited created the spells mortal wound, skull eyes,

skull  of  secrets,  and  triple  mask, all  of  which  are  commonly

used by his clerics. See the appendix for descriptions of these

items and spells.

The worship of Cyric does not grant any spell-like or super-

natural abilities by default, although the church knows of sev-

eral  rituals  that  grant  permanent  powers  to  the  devout  in

exchange for personal and monetary sacrifices. A ritual typi-

cally  takes  several  hours  and  requires  the  intervention  of  a

cleric of Cyric of 9th level or higher.

The Ritual of Honest Pain: The recipient of this ritual gains

a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Handle Animal checks.

The  recipients  lies  cannot  be  detected  as  such  by  spells  of

lower than 5th level, and she can lie freely within the bounds

of  a  zone  of  truth or  similar  spell.  This  supernatural  ability

functions automatically. The cost of this ritual is 2 points of

Constitution, since the magical process causes great pain and

trauma to the body. Restorative spells (such as restoration or

greater restoration) do not reverse this Constitution loss.

The Ritual of Black Charms: This ritual gives the recipient

the ability to use charm person (DC 11 + recipients Charisma

modifier) and suggestion (Dc 13 + recipients Charisma modi-

fier) each once per day as a supernatural ability. When used,

the recipients eyes turn completely black for 1 full round. The

recipients caster level is 5th. The ritual requires an opal worth

500 gp or more as a material component and drains 1,600 XP

from the recipient.

The Ritual of the Dark Flames: This ritual was created while

Cyric was still insane from reading the Cyrinishad. It allows the

recipient to invoke black flames of negative energy from her

hands as a supernatural ability. The flames are a ranged touch

attack with a range of 10 feet that deals 1d6 points of damage

per Hit Die of the user (undead are healed rather than damaged

by this effect). Unlike the similar ability possessed by the Spur

Lords  (see  below),  this  power  has  a  cost:  Each  time  the  dark

flames  are  invoked,  the  user  suffers  2  points  of  temporary

Wisdom damage. The ritual requires a black onyx worth at least

100 gp and drains 1,200 XP from the recipient.

Spur Lord Prestige Class

Cyricists who survive to reach higher levels usually show devo-

tion  to  their  deity  by  advancing  in  the  arcane  devotee,  divine

champion, divine disciple, divine seeker, or hierophant prestige

class. In recent years a unique military order has arisen within

the church called the Company of the Ebon Spur, composed of

fighters  and  warriors  of  at  least  3rd  level  who  favor  armor

spikes and shield spikes. Fanatics to the extreme, this group is led

by  evil  men  and  women  with  the  ability  to  channel  Cyrics

power. These strange and terrifying agents of the Dark Sun are

called Spur Lords.

The Spur Lords are the elite zealots of the church, wielding

the  dark  power  of  Cyric  and  commanding  the  attention  of

even the most fanatical clerics. Some consider them the future

dark saints of the church, destined to become powerful extra-

planar servants of Cyric after their deaths. Protected by Cyrics

power against threats within the church, the Spur Lords are

free  to  pursue  their  agendas  and  watch  over  the  trained  sol-

diers in their care. Because they can ignore clerical powers with

impunity, the Spur Lords work with the clerics without fear of

betrayal  to  promote  the  cause  of  Cyric.  Some  Spur  Lords

pursue  their  own  course,  with  a  small  contingent  of  Ebon

Spurs  in  tow.  When  not  acting  as  the  martial  arm  of  the

unholy power of Cyric, a Spur Lord is charismatic, confident,

and persuasive.

Most Spur Lords are fighters, rangers, rogues, or some com-

bination  thereof.  Clerics  have  never  been  known  to  become

Spur Lords, perhaps because their connection to Cyric prema-

turely  spoils  the  part  of  their  soul  that  Cyric  must  touch  to

create a leader of this caliber.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Spur Lord, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Bluff 3 ranks, Concentration 3 ranks, Knowledge (re-

ligion) 3 ranks, Sense Motive 3 ranks, Tumble 5 ranks.

Patron: Cyric.

Feats: Iron  Will,  Leadership,  Lightning  Reflexes,  Quick

Draw.

Special: The character must have either made peaceful con-

tact  with  an  evil  outsider  that  served  Cyric  or  received  a

prophetic dream from Cyric.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Spur Lord prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Spur  Lords  gain  profi-

ciency  with  the  longsword  and  one  other  simple  or  martial

weapon of their choice. They gain no proficiency in armor or

shields of any type.

Dark Bond (Su): A Spur Lord is immune to any harmful

spell,  spell-like  ability,  or  supernatural  ability  that  originates

from the power of Cyric. Such effects act as if the Spur Lord is

not  included  in  their  area.  This  includes  spells  waiting  to  be

triggered (such as glyph of warding) but not magic items cre-

ated by worshipers of Cyric. Whenever this ability is triggered,

a brief manifestation of a skull surrounded by black flames ap-

pears above the Spur Lords head.

Secret Blade (Su): At 2nd level, a Spur Lord has the ability

to magically hide an item as if he were wearing a glove of stor-

ing. Only one item can be concealed at a time in this manner,

although  the  Spur  Lord  can  cause  the  item  to  reappear  in

either hand as a free action, regardless of which hand was used

to store the item.

Dark Flames (Su): A Spur Lord of 3rd level or higher can

invoke  black  flames  of  negative  energy  from  his  hands.  The

flames are a ranged touch attack with a range of 10 feet and

deal 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the user (maximum

15d6). Undead are healed rather than damaged by this effect.

A Spur Lord can use this ability a number of times per day

equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier.

Cyrics  Glory (Sp): This  ability  allows  a  Spur  Lord  of  4th

level or higher to temporarily increase his presence and deter-

mination  to  phenomenal  levels  once  per  day.  He  gains  +4  to

Charisma  and  a  +2  morale  bonus  on  Will  saves.  Cyrics  glory

lasts  for  a  number  of  minutes  equal  to  1  +  the  characters

(newly improved) Charisma modifier.

Flesh of the Prince (Su): Usable once per day, this extreme

manifestation of Cyrics power shows that the Spur Lord has

reached the pinnacle of Cyrics favor. When it is invoked, his

skin turns chalk-white and his eyes turn dark and blaze with in-

fernal energy. In addition to all the abilities of the Cyrics glory

ability,  any  weapon  wielded  by  the  Spur  Lord  becomes  a  +1

flaming  weapon,  trailing  dark  flames  (this  does  not  increase

12

the bonus of a weapon with an enhancement bonus, but does

add the flaming ability if the weapon does not have it). The

Spur Lord also gains a +2 natural armor bonus and a +2 de-

flection bonus to AC. This ability lasts for a number of rounds

equal to 1 + the characters (newly improved) Charisma modi-

fier. When the power ends, the Spur Lord is fatigued until he

is able to rest for 1 minute. Using this ability does not count

toward his ability to call upon his Cyrics glory ability.

Twin Towers of the

Eternal Eclipse

Small Teeth Mountains, Amn.

Headquarters: The Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse, the

Members: Nearly  300  (including  servants)  split  between

two towers.

Leader: Blackwill Akhmelere.

In  the  Small  Teeth,  the  mountains  that  define  the  southern

border of Amn, loom a pair of fortified towers along the path

of the trade route into Tethyr. Originally constructed as tem-

ples  to  Bane,  they  were  overtaken  by  followers  of  Cyric  in

1362 DR, who tore down all evidence of Banes worship and re-

consecrated them in the name of the Dark Sun.

The towers are well concealed, each built within a stand of

tall and thick trees and protected from the sun by the moun-

tains  themselves.  Even  from  the  air  they  are  obscured,  with

only a shield-sized disc visible on each. The discs are made of

bronze  and  bear  Cyrics  holy  symbol  inset  with  tarnished

silver.  Each  castlelike  tower  stands  five  stories  tall  and  is  a

near duplicate of its neighbor. The towers are five miles apart,

with the Trade Way passing near the center of the distance be-

tween  them.  A  winding  underground  tunnel,  normally  used

only in emergencies, connects the towers. The general public

does not know the location of the Twin Towers, although Amn

and Tethyr would like to find and eradicate them.

The temples devotees keep its location secret through the use

of  illusion  and  abjuration  magic,  bribes  of  local  officials,  and

murdering anyone they think knows too much about the temple.

Each tower is almost fully independent, with over one hun-

dred soldiers, eleven clerics, six mages, and servants and support

staff  to  run  the  tower  itself.  An  adjacent  pen  holds  twenty  to

thirty pigs that dispose of slops and provide food. Large amounts

of grain and other staples are stored within each tower, and fresh

supplies are delivered weekly. The soldiers often engage in ban-

ditry and acquire supplies from caravans that use the Trade Way.

The  members  of  the  Twin  Towers  of  the  Eternal  Eclipse

exist  to  serve  Cyric.  Their  leader,  Blackwill  Akhmelere  (NE

Blackwill and guards

Cyric,  the  Mountain  of  Skulls.  That  temple  is  led  by  Tynnos

Argrim  (CE  male  human  Clr12  of  Cyric),  and  since  he  and

Blackwill Akhmelere both claim to oversee the supreme temple

to Cyric in southwestern Faern, bloody conflicts are inevitable.

If your campaign is not set near Amn or Tethyr, the map

of  the  Twin  Towers  can  be  used  for  another  location  near  a

major trade route.

LAYOUT OF THE TWIN TOWERS

These locations are rooms within the western tower. Because

of  the  towers  almost  identical  structure,  the  map  for  the

western tower can be rotated 180 degrees and used as the map

for the eastern tower.

The tower cannot be entered from the ground level, since the

drawbridge connects to the second floor of the tower. Therefore,

the numbering on the map begins on the second floor.

Unless otherwise noted, all doors are simple wooden doors

(break DC 15) with average locks (Open Lock DC 25). Interior

doors that do not lead to bedrooms are usually unlocked.

Several  locations  mention  an  alarm  bell,  which  is  a  large

brass bell with an attached cord. If rung, the alarm bell can be

heard  anywhere  on  that  floor  and  up  or  down  one  floor

(Listen Check DC 0). Each additional floor between the bell

and the listener increases the DC by 10.

The  foundation  around  the  dungeon  level  is  5-foot-thick

stone.

1. Entryway

The double doors on the other side of the drawbridge are iron

(break DC 28) with an amazing lock (Open Lock DC 40). The

doors  leading  farther  into  the  tower  are  strong  wood  (break

DC 25) with good locks (Open Lock DC 30). When the draw-

bridge  is  raised,  it  covers  the  main  door.  The  drawbridge  is

made of 4-inch-thick wood.

Two  soldiers  stand  guard  at  all  hours  in  this  location.  A

peephole on either side of the main doors allows them to see

outside  to  identify  visitors.  They  are  instructed  to  ring  the

alarm bell if anyone enters the tower without permission, par-

ticularly if intruders use magic to bypass its defenses, such as

by teleportation or gaseous form.

The areas marked 1A indicate the winches used to raise and

lower the drawbridge. One character on each winch can raise

or lower the drawbridge as a full-round action (Strength check

DC 12). A single character can attempt to raise or lower the

drawbridge halfway as a full-round action (DC 20). Each of

the winches is made primarily of rope and wood, and it can be

disabled if 15 or more points of damage penetrate its hardness

of 5.

Inside, the entry room is decorated with Cyricist tapestries

on the bare walls and paintings on the doors.

2. Watch Station

Each of the four corners of the temple has a pair of soldiers on

duty  at  all  times.  Each  tower  is  stocked  with  a  pair  of  long-

bows, forty arrows, and an alarm bell. With the arrow slits on

each open side, anyone here has a clear field of fire to targets

on this side of the tower.

3. Kitchen

This kitchen bustles almost every hour of the day. The people

who live here eat in staggered shifts, so the cooks work from

dawn  until  after  nightfall.  Extra  food  is  left  out  once  the

cooks go to bed so that residents up late (such as clerics in-

volved in a midnight ritual) can pick it up without having to

wait.  (Of  course,  if  the  clerics  dont  find  anything  to  their

liking, they dont think twice about pulling the cooks out

of  bed  to  serve  them.)  The  place  is  crammed  with  basins,

pots,  pans,  dishes,  and  silverware.  If  combat  takes  place

The Church of Cyric

here, inevitably a great deal of noise is generated from items

that  are  knocked  over  and  broken.  A  broad  fireplace  vents

outside the tower, and the small window opens upon a small

ledge  that  hangs  over  the  trough  in  the  pigpen.  Leftover

slops from the meals are dumped out this window to supple-

ment the pigs diet.

The  area  marked  3A  is  a  pantry,  primarily  used  to  store

spices,  cooking  supplies,  and  other  goods  that  are  used  often

but in small quantities.

4. Mess Hall

This  mess  hall  seats  thirty  comfortably.  Fifteen  to  twenty

people can be found here at any time during the day, most of

them soldiers.

5. Servants Quarters

Each of these quarters houses six servants (N humans Com1).

The servants clean the tower, prepare the food, and perform

other domestic duties.

6. Large Guardrooms

This  guardroom  is  the  sleeping  area  for  sixteen  Cyricist  sol-

diers (CN, NE, or CE humans Ftr1). Sixteen bunk beds fill the

room, and underneath each bed lies a chest protected by a very

simple lock (Open Lock DC 20). New soldiers transferred to

the tower are usually placed here. The coveted smaller guard-

rooms (area 7) are used as rewards for meritorious conduct.

7. Small Guardrooms

These guardrooms are the sleeping area for four Cyricist sol-

diers. The rooms contain two bunk beds and four chests, each

protected by a very simple lock (Open Lock DC 20).

8A/8B. Lieutenants Quarters

These  quarters  house  two  Cyricist  lieutenants  (NE  humans

Ftr3) each. Each lieutenant has a bed, a small desk, and a chest

with an average lock (Open Lock DC 25). 8A is the room of

Darvin and Stedd, and 8B is the room of Lusvil and Miri.

9. Guards Storage

The  guards  hang  their  armor  and  traveling  gear  in  these

rooms  when  not  in  use  (in  short,  anything  other  than  their

personal items, clothes, and melee weapons).

10. Shrine to Cyric

A  large  jawless  skull  made  of  stone  hangs  on  the  wall  in  the

center of a black-painted fireburst. A semicircular line on the

floor defines the border of the shrine, and a continual flame il-

luminates the area. The soldiers occasionally light a small fire

in a brazier and make offerings to Cyric here.

11. Guardpost

One soldier stands on duty here at all times in case any of the

prisoners manage to escape. Both doors in this room are usu-

ally kept closed to prevent the prisoners groans from bother-

ing the soldiers sleeping upstairs.

12. Escape Tunnel

This trapdoor in the floor (marked F) opens to a ladder that

leads 15 feet downward into a dry tunnel floored with stones

and  shored  up  every  20  feet  with  timbers.  Eventually  the

tunnel reaches the eastern tower. Small clay tubes pierce the

roof of the tunnel to allow some airflow. Two points along the

tunnel are merely a wooden roof with about 1 foot of dirt on

it, making it relatively easy to create an emergency exit from

the tunnel should both towers be attacked.

13. Torture Room

This room has a rack, a flat table with manacles, and various

torture instruments. There are no official torturers on staff in

the tower, so the clerics take turns. The less experienced clerics

sometimes accidentally kill their victims. The senior clerics con-

sider  this  unfortunate,  both  because  of  the  lost  chance  to  ac-

quire  information  and  because  of  the  loss  of  a  potential

sacrifice to the Dark Sun.

14. Cells

Iron bars enclose these cells, each of which has an iron door

with an average lock (Open Lock DC 25). Prisoners are only

doubled up in cells if no open cells are available. Between six to

ten prisoners languish here at any given time.

15. Meat Storage

This room has stacks of dried meats of various kinds. Only the

tower steward, the clerics, and the cooks have keys to the aver-

age lock (Open Lock DC 25) on this door.

16. Grain and Vegetable Storage

This room has bushels of grains and vegetables for use by the

cooking  staff.  Only  the  tower  steward,  the  clerics,  and  the

cooks  have  keys  to  the  average  lock  (Open  Lock  DC  25)  on

this door.

17AD. Minor Clerics and Lesser Mages

These room each house two minor clerics (all of Cyric) and a

lesser mage. Each person has a bed, a small desk, and a chest

with an average lock (Open Lock DC 25).

17A:  Malas  (CE  human  male  Clr2),  Randil  (CE  male

human Clr5), Mehmen (CE male human Wiz4).

17B:  Helem  (CE  male  human  Clr2),  Martas  (CE  female

human Clr5), Atala (CE female human Sor4).

17C:  Jaemorn  (CE  male  human  Clr2),  Thallonia  (CE

human female Clr5), Kaseir (CE male human Wiz4).

17D: Betha (CE female human Clr2), Talindra (CE female

half-elf Clr5), Westenra (CE female human Sor4).

18. Meeting Room

This  meeting  room  features  a  long  table  and  twelve  chairs.

Maps of Amn and Tethyr hang on the walls, with trade routes

marked  and  a  record  of  known  caravans  posted  nearby.  The

clerics,  mages,  captains,  and  lieutenants  meet  here  to  discuss

plans  such  as  banditry  against  caravans,  military  strikes

against other churches, recruitment, and so on.

19A/19B. Captain

This is the quarters for two Cyricist captains. Each room has a

bed,  a  small  desk,  and  a  chest  with  an  average  lock  (Open

Lock DC 25). Captain Sihvet (NE female human Ftr6) occu-

pies  room  19A,  Captain  Stev  (NE  male  human  Ftr6)  room

19B.

The Church of Cyric

20. Steward

This  is  the  quarters  of  Zasheir  (NE  male  human  Exp4),  the

tower steward. He commands the servants and is responsible

for  tracking  the  towers  supplies  and  requisitioning  more

goods. Zasheir is a coward and surrenders if threatened by in-

vaders. The room has a bed, a small desk, and a chest with an

average lock (Open Lock DC 25).

21A/21B. Religious Items

The door to this room is painted with the symbol of Cyric. The

room contains the ceremonial robes and other religious items

used by the clerics during ceremonies and rituals. The door has

a good lock (Open Lock DC 30). Any person aside from the

clerics  who  handles  these  items  without  permission  is  sen-

tenced to death.

Some of the items are made of or contain precious materi-

als.  If  these  items  are  collected,  they  weigh  a  total  of  25

pounds and are worth 500 gp. All bear symbols of Cyric.

A hidden compartment (Search DC 20) in the back of room

21A  holds  six  scrolls  placed  for  use  if  the  tower  is  attacked.

Only the lesser clerics and Blackwill know the scrolls are here.

22. Banelars Lair

This large room contains little more than a pair of staircases,

four pillars, and an alarm bell. It is also the lair of Sebesken, a

banelar in the service of the temple. Everyone who lives in the

tower (including all the soldiers) are introduced to the creature

so it may recognize them later. It rings the alarm and attacks

if it notices intruders. The banelar carries a ring of protection

+2 and a wand of magic missile (5th-level caster, 23 charges)

at all times. A small shelf near the top of the southeast pillar

contains the rest of its personal treasure (632 gp in a leather

sack), which it sometimes uses to bribe other residents of the

tower for information and livestock. When here, the banelar

coils  about  one  of  the  pillars  near  the  ceiling.  It  is  familiar

with the tactics of the other beings that live on its floor and

coordinates its attacks appropriately. Sebesken knows the invis-

ibility and see invisibility spells, and often wanders the tower in

search of invisible invaders.

23A/23B. Lesser Cleric

This is the residence of a lesser cleric. The door is protected by

a  glyph  of  warding (inflict  serious  wounds,  3d8+7,  Will  half

DC 14, Search DC 28, Disable Device DC 28) set to react to

anyone who touches the door without first speaking the pass-

word  (known  only  to  this  cleric  and  to  Blackwill  Akhmelere

himself). The room has a bed, a small desk, and a chest with an

average lock (Open Lock DC 25). Room 23A is the residence

of Zorn (NE male human Clr7 of Cyric). Room 23B is the res-

idence of Kari (NE female human Clr7 of Cyric).

24A/24B. Mages

This  is  the  residence  of  a  mage  of  the  church.  The  door  is

locked  by  an  arcane  lock spell.  The  room  has  a  bed,  a  small

desk,  and  a  chest  with  an  average  lock  (Open  Lock  DC  25).

Room  24A  is  the  room  of  Barkeid  (CE  male  human  Sor9).

Room 24B is the room of Yabasina (CE female human Wiz9).

Room 24C is the roof of one of the towers, used as a bal-

cony. The door to the balcony is an iron door with a good lock

(Open Lock DC 30) and is also warded by an arcane lock spell.

This balcony is an excellent vantage point for hurling spells at

times when the tower is under attack.

25. Tower Roof

This roof of this secondary tower is normally used as an obser-

vation  point,  but  it  has  been  the  site  of  several  accidental

falls that resulted in the death of more than one upstart cleric

or soldier. The door to the balcony is an iron door with a good

lock (Open Lock DC 30). A soldier stands guard at this point

at all hours, and a large bell can be struck to alert the tower.

26. Watchful Skull

This  is  the  room  of  Blackwill  Akhmelere,  the  high  priest  of

this  temple.  His  title  is  the  Watchful  Skull,  and  within  the

temple  he  normally  dresses  in  his  ceremonial  armor  and

priestly garb.

The door is protected by a greater glyph of warding (slay

living, Fort partial DC 19, Search DC 31, Disable Device DC

31) set to react to anyone other than Blackwill himself. The

room  has  a  large  luxurious  bed,  a  large  desk,  a  sturdy  and

comfortable chair, and a chest with a good lock (Open Lock

DC 30).

Room 26A is the roof of one of the towers, used as a balcony.

The door to the balcony is an iron door with an amazing-quality

lock. It is also warded by a greater glyph of warding identical to

the one on the door. This balcony is an excellent vantage point

for hurling spells at times when the tower is under attack, but

Blackwill typically uses it to enjoy some fresh air.

In the eastern tower of the Eternal Eclipse, this room is

occupied  by  Olma  Kulenov  the  Bloody  (NE  female  human

Clr11 of Cyric), the second most powerful cleric at the Twin

Towers.  She  loathes  Blackwill  but  knows  she  cannot  defeat

him without help.

Blackwill  Akhmelere  was  born  of  a  merchant  family  in  the

Tethyrian capital of Darromar. He joined the church of Bane

when traveling with a caravan to Amn, where he was an un-

exceptional cleric. When Bane died during the Time of Trou-

bles,  Blackwill  converted  early  to  the  worship  of  Cyric,  a

move that allowed him to rocket to a station unavailable to

him under the old church. He was one of the leaders of the

army that sacked the Twin Towers, and he later claimed it for

his own when all the other leaders died or left under mysteri-

ous circumstances.

Blackwill  has  gathered  a  large  number  of  loyal  Cyricists

under his command and feels confident in his ability to detect

or defeat those who would try to remove him from his posi-

tion. His years in the service of Bane taught him the need for

discipline,  information,  and  preparation,  which  helps  him

maintain control of his temple.

27. Unholy Chamber

This profane chamber stinks of evil and human sacrifice. All

but a 10-foot-wide path around the perimeter of the room is

inlaid with dull gray tiles. A tall brazier stands in the corner

of each room, decorated with motifs of skulls, closed eyes, and

bloody weapons. The center part of the tile mosaic changes to

purple tiles that form a sunburst, at the center of which is a 2-

foot-tall pedestal in the shape of a jawless skull and adorned

with  white  tiles.  The  entire  room  is  warded  by  an  unhallow

spell  (with  the  secondary  effect  of  protection  from  elements

[fire] on anyone who holds Cyric as their patron).

Lining the outer perimeter of the room are twenty skele-

tons (marked S on the map), each wearing full plate and hold-

ing  a  longsword.  Each  was  given  unlife  by  Blackwill.  They

attack anyone who isnt a cleric of Cyric. Because clerics gain

a  +4  profane  bonus  on  rebuking  undead  here,  any  cleric  of

Cyric has a good chance to be able to command these skele-

tons into service. While the skeletons are too weak to be much

of a threat against most attackers that would be able to pene-

trate this part of the tower, they are good at slaying weak but

lucky foes or delaying those of moderate power.

The ceiling has four trapdoors (marked C on the map), each

locked with an amazing lock (Open Lock DC 40) and guarded by

a  greater  glyph  of  warding (slay  living,  Fort  partial  DC  19,

Search DC 31, Disable Device DC 31) triggered by anyone not of

the Cyricist religion. Only Blackwill and the lesser clerics have

copies of the key.

High  rituals  to  Cyric  are  performed  here,  ranging  from

human  sacrifice  to  ordaining  new  clerics  to  summoning

demons and other creatures to serve the Dark Sun.

Defending the Tower

While they may be generally undisciplined and chaotic, Black-

wills soldiers are trained in certain tactics to deal with attacks

against the tower, particularly those that manage to penetrate

its defenses.

External Attacks

Standard procedure is to sound the alarm bell, then send volley

after volley of arrows into whatever external threat appears.

17

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/23/01  4:23 PM  Page 18

The Cult of the Dragon

If the enemy has defenses against arrows, is capable of making

magical attacks (including the presence of a spellcaster), or is

otherwise a strange creature capable of ignoring such damage

and  still  harming  the  tower  or  its  inhabitants  (such  as  a

chimera or dragon), the spellcasters of the tower bolster the

towers defenses and lash out magically against their foes.

Invasion

If an alarm sounds, the first groups to arrive are two squads of

six soldiers, each led by a lieutenant (EL 6 each group). The

lieutenants  evaluate  the  situation  before  entering  combat,

shouting for more aid if they think it necessary (especially if

they  feel  they  need  backup  from  the  clerics  or  mages).  An-

other squad of six guards (EL 5) arrives every fifth round to

deal with the problem unless it is apparent that doing so is bla-

tantly  suicidal  (although  these  guards  might  stay  at  a  range

and fire upon the enemy without closing to melee distance).

If clerics are requested, minor clerics (one Clr2 and one Clr5)

accompanied by six more guards arrive to participate (EL 7).

If  mages  are  requested,  one  of  the  lesser  mages  (Sor4  or

Wiz4) arrives with six guards and a lieutenant (EL 7).

Should these groups prove insufficient to repel or slay the in-

vaders, a captain comes with one of the lesser clerics (Clr7) or a

mage (Sor9 or Wiz9) and a squad of six guards (EL 9 for cleric

group, EL 11 for mage group). The banelar enters the fray only

if commanded to by Blackwill (or, if he is absent, the lesser cleric

he placed in command), and Blackwill only appears if it seems

that his minions have proven unable to defeat their opponents.

The Cult of the

Dragon

And naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers.

But the dead dragons shall rule the world entire. . . .

As  the  purple  robed  figure  on  the  platform  continued  to

intone the litany, Harnath Tommor, lesser mage of the Cult of

the Dragon, gave only part of his attention to the speaker. The

other  half  was  focused  on  the  incredible  sight  before  him:  an

aged blue dragon, its serpentine form at rest on the platform next

to the Wearer of Purple. As he watched the ceremony continue,

Harnaths chest swelled with pride. At last, here was the day

that he had waited and worked for since he first joined the

Cult. Today, he would see the ultimate proof of Sammasters

wisdom  as  the  dragon  abandoned  its  fetters  of  life  and

became a Sacred Onea dracolich.

.  .  .  and  the  dominion  of  the  dead  dragons  shall

endure  until  the  end  of  all  things.  So  we  swear,  con-

cluded the Wearer of Purple.

So we swear, echoed the dozens of cultists who stood

expectantly  within  the  Chamber  of  Ascendance.

From somewhere within the folds of his ceremonial

garb, the officiating cultist withdrew two objects: a

clay flask and an enormous ruby. Unstoppering the

flask, the cultist proffered it to the dragon. Gracefully, the blue

wyrm opened its huge maw. The cultist obliged, pouring the con-

tents of the flask onto its tongue. A collective ahhh went through

the watching cultists, and Harnath thought that he could catch a

hint of a strange scent in the air. Sulfur?

Suddenly the dragons jaws clenched tightly together, and the

Wearer  of  Purple  snatched  his  hand  away  barely  in  time.  A

spasm  wracked  the  great  creatures  body,  and  then  it  slumped

forward on the platform and lay still. A brilliant light filled

the  ruby,  spilling  over  into  the  hand  of  the  Wearer  of  Purple.

The light flared once, and then receded until it became a muted

but constant glow. It was done. The first part of the transforma-

tion was complete. By the time the sun set this evening, Faern

would know a new terror.

The  members  of  the  Cult  of  the  Dragon  believe  that  it  is

Faerns destiny to be ruled by undead dragons. The Cult takes

upon itself the responsibility of helping that destiny along, di-

recting all its plans and energies toward gaining the wealth and

magical  power  necessary  to  transform  living  dragons  into

undead dracoliches. Cult members undertake magical research,

espionage, mercantilism, and a variety of criminal activities to

fund and support their goal in anticipation of the day when the

undead dragons will hold sway over the entire world. Many Cult

members are therefore criminals, though in their minds and in

the minds of their peers they are heroic and devoted individuals

who take great personal risks on behalf of the organization.

More than one adventurer has remarked on the fact that the

minds  of  the  Cults  current  members  (including  the  Cults

founder, the archmage Sammaster) are not always entirely bal-

anced. Indeed, some are quite mad, though their insanity makes

them all the more dangerous in the deadly serious pursuit of their

goals. The cultists venerate dragons to the point of worshiping

them as deities, and certain dragonslured by promises of eter-

nal unlife and overwhelming powerrevel in the attention.

Brief History

Over four centuries have passed since the Cult of the Dragon

first appeared in Faern, and another century before that since

the  Cults  founder  and  first  leader,  Sammaster  First-Speaker,

was born. Sammaster was a powerful archmage who became one

of Mystras Chosen, an honor that proved too great a burden.

The archmages mind could not bear the divine power, and Sam-

master eventually went insane. By the time the deity rescinded

her gift, it was too late: Sammaster was incurably mad.

Suffering  from  terrible  delusions,  the  mad  archmage  in-

sisted that he possessed special insight into the future of Toril,

its  people,  and  its  deities.  He  began  collecting  both  well-

known and obscure works of oracular knowledge and trans-

lating  them  (or  reinterpreting  them,  as  the  Cults

detractors and enemies would have it) as validation of

his  claims.  In  the  pages  of  one  of  these  tomes,

Maglass Chronicle of Years to Come, Sammaster discov-

ered a cryptic prophecy that he believed predicted that

undead dragons would eventually rule the world. Thus

inspired, the irrational archmage gathered a band

of followers and persuaded them that his fore-

telling  of  the  future  was  accurate.  In  902  DR

the Cult of the Dragon created its first dracol-

ich, using necromantic formulas that Sammaster inscribed in

his magnum opus, Tome of the Dragon. Sammaster eventually

diedor, as some Cult members believe, became a lich and dis-

appeared. Today, the inheritors of his terrible knowledge con-

tinue to carry out his legacy.

The Cult of the Dragon

The Organization

Headquarters:  The  members  of  the  Cult  do  not  presently

maintain  a  central  headquarters.  However,  they  are  in  the

process of constructing onea mighty fortress in the Western

Heartlands,  built  over  an  extinct  volcano  that  houses  the

fabled Well of Dragons.

Members: Nearly  1,000  individuals  are  knowing,  willing,

and  active  members  of  the  Cult.  Countless  more  serve  the

cultists without suspecting who they serve.

Hierarchy: Webbed.

Leaders: The Wearers of Purple (formerly the name used

by leaders of the Sembian cells, now adopted for the organiza-

tion as a whole).

Religion: None, though the Cults few clerics primarily wor-

ship  Bane,  Shar,  Talos,  Talona,  or  Velsharoon.  A  handful  of

others venerate Cyric, Gargauth, Malar, or Tiamat.

Alignment: CE, CN, NE.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: The  Cult  uses  the  symbol  of  a  flame  with  eyes

burning  above  a  dragons  claw,  but  cultists  display  it  openly

only when a cell or individual member can be sure that it will

not attract the attention of the Cults many dedicated foes. Be-

cause some groups of cultists sometimes take it into their heads

to work at cross purposes with their fellows for reasons rang-

ing from madness to pure contrariness, the exact appearance

of this symbol varies from cell to cell.

The  Cult  of  the  Dragon  continues  its  founders  work  by  or-

ganizing itself into a number of independent cells, each with a

specific purpose and role to play in the groups larger plans.

The teachings of Sammaster have attracted a limited number

of  followers,  some  of  them  as  delusional  as  he  was,  others

lured by the promise of great rewards gained by means other

than  honest  toil.  Many  of  the  Cults  current  members  are

sane  (so  far)  but  exhibit  other  defects  of  mind  or  character

that convince them that the Cult offers a path to their desires

that is quicker and easier than any other. Virtually all cultists

are human.

HIERARCHY

Individual cells comprise the basic units of the Cults organiza-

tional structure. Even as each cell is specialized, so too do rank,

function,  and  purpose  differentiate  the  members  roles.  Any

given cell normally has from ten to one hundred members, de-

pending on its relative importance in the Cults great schemes.

The cells hierarchy is based on a structure followed through-

out the Cult.

So  called  because  of  their  purple  ceremonial  robes,  the

Wearers of Purple are the chief authority in every cell. Small

cells have only one Wearer of Purple at the helm, but larger

cells can have several, all acting (theoretically) in concert as

part  of  a  coalition.  More  than  a  few  Wearers  of  Purple  are

necromancers who seek out Cult of the Dragon cells for the

specific  purpose  of  joining  their  ranks.  These  necromancers

oversee the complex process by which a living dragon is trans-

formed into a dracolich. They also create magic items, both

for use by Cult members and as gifts and bribes to evil drag-

ons. It is additionally their burden to make up the shortfalls

faced  by  the  Cult  due  to  the  scarcity  of  clerics  among  its

membership. These wizards cannot afford to be armchair gen-

erals  if  the  Cult  is  to  achieve  its  goals:  When  a  cell  faces

danger from enemies, the Wearers of Purple must lead their

forces against the enemy.

The Cult offers necromancers access to the otherwise diffi-

cult-to-find research conducted by Sammaster, and the chance to

work directly with some of the most powerful undead creatures

in all Faern. Others join to further their own ambitions or be-

cause they found the endless internal conflicts of other organi-

zation (such as the Zhentarim) unsatisfactory to their tastes.

Below the Wearers of Purple are the lesser members of the

cell, their designations determined by the cells specific function.

Mercantile Cells

Some cells are devoted to pursuing completely legitimate busi-

ness interests as a means of generating cash flow. The lesser

members of these cells tend to be merchants, many of them

quite  wealthy.  These  cells  take  advantage  of  their  trade  con-

tacts and communications to gather and pass along interesting

information to other cells.

Criminal Cells

The majority of Cult cells generate the needed coin through il-

legal means, and the schemes in which they are involved are as

varied as the members themselves.

Banditry

Cells sometimes engage the services of bandits, brigands, and

highway robbers to relieve travelers of their excess cash. Raids

on merchant caravans can be extremely lucrative, both in gold

and trade goods (later sold by mercantile or smuggling cells).

These  cells  are  small,  consisting  generally  of  a  Wearer  of

Purple  and  perhaps  half  a  dozen  subordinates  who  deal  with

the local bandits. The outlaws who do the actual work usually

do not know who hired them, and they usually dont care.

Protection

The  Cult  of  the  Dragon  generally  avoids  protection  rackets

on  the  small  scale.  The  organization  isnt  large  enough  to

dominate the underworld in most major cities, which is where

protection  money  really  pays  off.  It  leaves  such  pursuits  to

local  thieves  guilds  and  unscrupulous  merchants.  Instead,  it

engages  in  grand-scale  protection  rackets,  threatening  care-

fully  chosen  merchants  with  draconic  intervention  should

they  fail  to  meet  the  Cults  demands  for  money,  goods,  or

services.  Once  a  merchant  so  approached  realizes  exactly

whom hes dealing with, he usually pays the demanded price:

Everyone knows, after all, that you cant bargain with insane

people. These cells usually consist of a Wearer of Purple who

deals  with  the  dracolich  or  dragon  muscle,  and  a  dozen  or

more operatives who deal with the merchants themselves. The

cell may also employ laborers or traders who handle any ill-

gotten merchandise for a fee.

Kidnapping

Abducting wealthy nobles and ransoming them back to their

families  can  generate  a  large  amount  of  gold.  Many  aristo-

crats  pay  up  less  out  of  any  desire  to  regain  the  kidnapped

member  of  the  family,  and  more  out  of  a  more  profound

desire not to suffer the embarrassing notoriety of being the

A dracolich created by the Cult

targets  of  a  successful  kidnapping  plot.  The  Cult  almost

always  releases  its  hostages  after  the  ransom  is  paid;  other-

wise, other victims families might start refusing to pay, and

that would end this particular line of handsome profit very

quickly.

The lairs of evil dragons make very convenient and secure

holding places for kidnapping victims who might be located by

friends  or  allies  before  their  ransom  is  paid.  The  Cults  few

rogues generally work within kidnapping cells, along with sev-

eral fighters who take care of the actual kidnapping as directed

by the Wearer of Purple.

Blackmail and Extortion

Here again, the desire to avoid scandal generates a good deal of

money.  Few  people  want  to  see  their  dark  secrets  publicized,

and  some  folk  possess  secrets  that  are  more  dangerous  than

they are embarrassing.

Blackmail is a delicate business, because it involves continu-

ous regular payments. Cells engaged in this activity must use

care not to demand such a high fee that they kill the golden

goose, or that the goose decides that exposure is less expensive

than payment.

Extortion, on the other hand, requires only a one-time pay-

ment and is therefore preferable in situations where the target

has a limited amount of ready cash. The cells that engage in

these activities generally have only a very few actual cultists,

but large numbers of paid spies and informers, most of whom

sell information not only to the cell but to anyone who can

pay. Some cells boast their own private spy networks, but com-

petition for genuinely blackmail-worthy secrets is so stiff that

this is a rarity.

Smuggling

An old favorite not only of the Cult but many other criminal

groups,  smuggling  is  a  thriving  industry.  Stolen  magic  items

make up the bulk of the Cults smuggled goods, though poisons

and illicit drugs are also popular. These cells can be quite large:

The Cults Sembian smuggling cell has more than one hundred

cultists.

Vice

A  very  few  cells  possess  enough  control  over  the  criminal  ele-

ment in some smaller communities to run secret (and therefore

untaxed) gambling dens, drug parlors, and festhalls. These cells

rarely boast more than a dozen members, though they do employ

several times that number of hired muscle. The employees of the

vice establishments almost never know who pays their wages.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The senior members of the Cult are unequally divided into two

camps:  those  who  believe  completely  and  wholeheartedly  in

Sammasters  prophecies,  and  those  who  pretend  to  do  so  for

their  own  reasons.  The  latter  few  are  most  often  individuals

who see membership in the Cult as a way to fulfill whatever

personal desires they may have for power, wealth, self-impor-

tance,  magical  knowledge,  or  even  amusement.  Whats  the

harm  in  working  toward  a  Faern  ruled  by  undead  dragons,

they reason, if it makes me rich, powerful, and important along

the way? These members suspect that the Cult wont ever reach

its goals, but theres no denying that having a dracolich or two

as an ally certainly makes a life of crime a lot easier.

The fanatics, however, are the really dangerous members of

the Cult, and they make up the bulk of the membership at the

20

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/23/01  4:37 PM  Page 21

The Cult of the Dragon

higher levels. They believe so strongly and completely in their

insane goal that they are willing not only to die for it, but also

to take anyone else who may get in their way along with them.

Many  people  who  aid  the  Cult  of  the  Dragon  dont  even

know that they are doing so. These folk are the bandits, merce-

naries, merchants, and smugglers who go about their normal

activities in return for payment, unknowing and uncaring of

their employers identity. But some do know, and purposefully

seek  out  the  Cult  with  the  intention  of  becoming  members.

Why would an otherwise ordinary person decide to join a group

of power-hungry wizards who use the demented ravings of a

long-dead  madman  to  transform  dragons  into  undead  mon-

strosities as a prelude to conquering the world?

For  starters,  some  power-hungry  recruits  lack  the  talent,

wealth,  or  charisma  to  attain  that  power  on  their  own.  The

Cult offers them a way to sate that hunger in a way thats more

viable  than  vague  self-generated  plans  to  conquer  the  world.

Others are greedy and relish the coin that the Cult generates;

the promise of future power is merely an added enticement to

the  avaricious.  Still  others  are  the  descendants  of  previous

members, and they intend to carry on the family tradition. A

fairsome  might  say  alarmingnumber  of  the  average

Cultists either believe or come to believe very strongly in the

prophetic doom pronounced by Sammaster.

Those  who  have  seen  the  terrible  grandeur  and  awesome

power of a dracolich begin to believe that the crazy old arch-

mage may have been onto something after all. To many ordi-

nary folk, a dragon might as well be a deity: It might not be

able to grant divine spells, but it ranks among the most power-

ful mortal creatures on Toril.

When the chance of ones patron deity coming to ones aid in

times of difficulty is unlikely at best, the Cults dracoliches and

evil dragons can serve as reliable allies. Additionally, the notion

of an impending apocalypse is appealing to some people, partic-

ularly those who are convinced that only the true believers

will survive the doomsday and then inherit the world.

RECRUITING

The  Cult  of  the  Dragon  has  mixed  feeling  about  new  re-

cruits.  On  the  one  hand,  theres  no  denying  that  the  Cult

needs fresh blood to replace those members who either die

of  old  age  (rather  than  become  liches,  an  option  actively

sought  by  some)  or  who  perish  at  the  swords  of  enemies.

And  the  more  members  the  Cult  has,  the  more  quickly  it

can bring about the subjugation of Faern under the claws

of the dracoliches.

On the other hand, the Cult has been the victim of count-

less infiltration attempts sponsored by its enemies. Several of

the Cults weaker cells have been wiped out by foes, and it takes

time, money, and effort to recover these losses. So how does

the Cult deal with the double-edged sword of the prospective

recruit?

Simple:  It  doesnt.  The  Wearers  of  Purple  trust  in  the

word  of  Sammaster,  who  wrote:  .  .  .  and  all  our  enemies

shall be revealed in good time. Those who would oppose us

shall fall to ruin and death in the jaws of the dead dragons.

And their bodies shall crack and their hair shall burn, and

they  will  know  in  their  last  moments  that  theirs  was  the

path of folly. For the reign of the dead dragons cannot be

forestalled, cannot be thwarted, cannot be broken. Despite

the fact that the Cults enemies do sometimes succeed in in-

filtrating its ranks and wreaking havoc with operations, the

Wearers  of  Purple  nonetheless  cling  stubbornly  to  their

belief that all the efforts of their foes will prove, ultimately,

to be futile.

ALLIES

The most common allies of the Cult are evil dragons and the

dracoliches that the Cult creates. The Cult is not averse to co-

operating  temporarily  with  evil  monsters  or  even  a  few  evil

adventurers, and certainly its necromancers are capable of cre-

ating undead creatures to serve many different functions. In-

dividual members have been known to make deals with chaotic

Cult of the Dragon: Tips for the DM

The Cult is, compared to some of the other groups that are

considered leading evil organizations, something of a white

elephant.  Its  numbers  are  not  large,  and  while  some  of  its

allies are quite powerful the Cult does not wield vast influ-

ence. The sheer insanity of its goals makes it difficult to take

the organization seriously. Nevertheless, the Cult is both per-

sistent and pervasive. Its weathered some nasty knocks in its

four hundred-plus years of existence, retrenched, and rebuilt.

But  more  important,  the  Cults  potential  for  doing  serious

harm  makes  it  an  attractive  component  of  campaign  vil-

lainy. If Faerns heroes were to ignore the Cult completely,

dismissing  it  as  just  an  association  of  fringe  lunatics,  the

number of dracoliches might well proliferate speedily.

Because  the  Cult  has  so  many  interests  in  a  number  of

cities, all busy raising money and gathering information for

the  greater  glory  of  a  dracolich-ruled  Faern,  encounters

with cultists can occur nearly anywhere. Heroes who inter-

fere  with  a  group  of  bandits  or  smugglers  might  discover

that theyve actually just thwarted the plans of the Cult, and

that they must now contend with angry necromancers and

their undead allies. An adventuring party might sign on to

guard  a  merchants  caravan  as  it  makes  its  way  across  the

treacherous Savage Frontier, only to be attacked by a dracol-

ich because the merchant refused to pay the Cults blackmail

(and forgot to mention that little fact to the heroes).

The Cults need for secrecy means that cell headquarters

wont be easily visible: Adventurers hoping to do battle with

the Cult wont be able to knock on the door of a big temple

with a convenient Cult of the Dragon symbol or sign hung

on the exterior. Ferreting out a Cult cell takes patience, time,

perseverance,  and  some  luck.  Attempting  to  infiltrate  a

known cell, perhaps at the request of a Harper agent or the

local government, can make an exciting adventure all on its

own. And an expedition to the Well of Dragons (see below)

might  prove  to  be  a  challenging  multipart  adventure  for

higher-level characters.

The Cult of the Dragon

and evil outsiders, though Cult policy discourages interacting

with  demons  and  devils.  The  church  of  Cyric  is  a  sometime

ally, though this is a less common occurrence since Cyric lost

the portfolio of death.

Its  members  know  the  dracoliches  created  by  the  Cult  as

Sacred  Ones,  since  they  are  the  forces  destined  to  reign

supreme over the world. The process of creating a dracolich,

and  the  statistics  for  these  fell  creatures,  are  detailed  in  the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Dealing with Dragons

Dragons  in  general  are  a  notoriously  self-centered  race,  and

none more so than the evil dragons of Faern. Yet the Cult ap-

proaches  these  incredibly  powerful  beings  routinely,  visiting

their  lairs  to  advise  them  of  the  great  destiny  that  awaits

them. Cultists bring large gifts of treasure to the dragons they

visit, as a contribution to their hoards (another reason why the

Cult  requires  such  a  large  amount  of  cash).  They  flatter  the

dragons,  praise  their  skill  and  cunning,  offer  to  provide  any

services that the dragons may desire, andusually on a visit

subsequent to the firstread to the dragon from Sammasters

Tome of the Dragon.

Some evil dragons deal regularly with the cultists, exchang-

ing the Cults services for permission to shelter in the dragons

lair in times of emergency. Cult cells serve as the eyes and ears

of the evil dragons with which they have allied. Others dismiss

the  cultists  as  crazed  fools,  and  the  cultists  generally  leave

these  dragons  alone,  at  least  for  a  generation  or  two.  More

than one dragon that rejected a deputation from the Cult of

the Dragon centuries ago is more disposed to treat with them

after two or three hundred years have passed, particularly the

lesser dragons that havent done as well for themselves as they

had hoped to do. Theres no harm, these creatures reason, in al-

lowing the cultists to add some new traps to the lair if all thats

required is paying attention to some ancient prophetic writings

(which many evil dragons find quite interesting when they ac-

tually pay attention).

While  the  cultists  venerate  the  evil  dragons,  their  visita-

tions and offers of aid do have ulterior motives: first to per-

suade  the  dragons  to  cooperate  actively  with  the  Cult,  and

second  to  eventually  convince  the  dragons  to  undergo  the

transformation into lichdom.

The Sacred Ones

Many folk mistakenly assume that the Cult of the Dragon

exercises  complete  control  over  the  dracoliches  it  creates.

Dracoliches are, just like living dragons, independent-minded

creatures  that  can  and  do  embark  on  plans  and  schemes  of

their  own  (presumably  to  keep  themselves  occupied  while

they wait for Sammasters predictions to come true). Dracol-

iches do cooperate regularly with the Cult, however, exchang-

ing  their  protection  for  the  cultists  services.  A  dracolich

might agree to destroy a merchant vessel or caravan, for in-

stance, so that a Cult cell can persuade a noble or merchant

to  cooperate.  In  return  the  Cult  brings  the  dracolich  offer-

ings of treasure and valuable information, and provides reas-

surance  that  the  end  times  for  Faern  are  indeed

approaching quickly.

ENEMIES

Most  Faernians  see  the  Cult  of  the  Dragon  as  a  dangerous

group of lunatics. But the Cult doesnt receive as much atten-

tion as the Zhentarim, the church of Cyric, or the shades be-

cause the threat posed by the Cult seems less immediate. (At

least, it seems less immediate to anyone who has never watched

in stupefied horror as a dracolich makes mincemeat out of her

adventuring companions, or smashes a Sembian warship into

so many splinters.) Nevertheless, the Cult of the Dragon has

its enemies, principally those groups who either compete with

the Cult for resources and turf, or those dedicated to ensuring

that evil folk do not prevail.

The Cult of the Dragon is content to leave the Red Wizards

of  Thay  to  their  own  devices,  secure  in  the  knowledge  that

Thay will eventually be just another vassal state when the un-

dead dragons rule the world. Indeed, recent relations between

the Cult and the Red Wizards have been businesslike and pro-

fessional  to  the  point  of  courteousness,  because  the  Cult  has

discovered that its quicker and easier to purchase magic items

at an enclave than to create its own. But individual Red Wiz-

ards continue to plague the organization: They have an annoy-

ing  habit  of  attempting  to  acquire  the  Cults  necromantic

knowledge for themselves, and an even more annoying habit

of trying to subvert the evil dragons allied to the Cult. How-

ever,  strife  between  the  organizations  is  generally  limited  to

individual Red Wizards and Cult cells rather than to society-

wide warfare.

Wherever the Cult of the Dragon maintains criminal cells,

it comes into conflict with the local crime lords. Whether its

the Night Masks in Westgate or the Iron Throne in Sembia,

the Cult runs afoul of those competing for the same ill-gotten

gains. These conflicts can be as inconsequential as a disagree-

ment over territory that is settled by a pact or a sum of com-

pensating gold paid to one side or the other. They can also be

as desperate as full-scale armed opposition with both factions

struggling  openly  for  control  of  the  desired  prize.  The  Cult

prefers to bargain its way out of these problems, but when it

cant,  its  members  dig  in  and  fight.  The  Wearers  of  Purple

devise the strategy their cells employ against rival organiza-

tions, and they also join the rank and file in the fighting.

Not  surprisingly,  the  Cult  of  the  Dragon  and  the  Harpers

have battled one another ever since the Cult came into being.

The Harpers oppose the Cult the same way that they oppose all

individuals or groups who seek to force their will on others (or

conquer the world, a much broader application of the same con-

cept). Harper agents continually attempt to infiltrate Cult cells

and disrupt their operations. Some individual Harpers have ded-

How Cultists act

The  following  are  typical  personalities  and  attitudes  for

Cultists.

Wearer  of  Purple: Scholarly  and  visionary,  with  a  fa-

natical demeanor and the wide-eyed stare of the devoted

lunatic or absent-minded professor.

Lesser Mage: Ambitious and power-hungry, with an eye

toward the future.

Fighter Bodyguard: Alert and aggressive.

22

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/23/01  4:39 PM  Page 23

The Cult of the Dragon

icated their entire lives to identifying and stopping Cult agents,

while others merely strive against the cultists whenever they are

encountered. Its a special event for a cell when a Harper spy is

discovered  in  its  midst:  After  taking  the  agent  prisoner,  the

cultists  usually  convey  him  or  her  to  the  nearest  allied  evil

dragon  or  dracolich  to  be  messily  devoured.  This  sight  never

fails to bring broad smiles to the faces of the attending cultists.

Encounters

Cultists rarely, if ever, travel openly. They cannot afford to

proclaim  their  presence,  so  they  disguise  themselves  and

travel in small groups to avoid scrutiny. A typical encounter

with a group of Cultists involves a wizard leader plus another

wizard and some bodyguards (usually fighters but sometimes

barbarians  or  even  warriors,  if  the  leader  is  from  a  weaker

cell).  The  wizards  are  normally  specialized  in  Necromancy.

Only the biggest and most important cells contain clerics. The

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting contains statistics for

a typical wizard Cult member.

SAMPLE GROUPS

Cult Encounter (EL 4): 1 lesser mage (CE human Wiz2), 2

bodyguards (NE human Ftr1, Rgr1, or Rog1).

assistant (CE human Sor2 or Wiz2), 2 bodyguards (NE human

(NE  human  Clr6  of  Velsharoon),  2  bodyguards  (NE  human

Ftr8, Rgr8, or Rog8).

COMBAT AND TACTICS

Though  the  Cultists  are  organized  into  differentiated  cells,

their reaction to danger tends to be unstructured. Each member

of the cell tends to act according to his or her best judgment,

though all attempt in their own way to support the cell. Cult

wizards normally respond to threats directly with their spells,

and clerics do likewise, while bodyguards and flunkies do their

best to engage attackers physically. If a battle goes poorly, the

wizards generally shift to defensive spells or illusions and try to

escape. They may or may not stop to assist colleagues, depend-

ing on their individual relationships. The Cults lack of specific

responses may make it more dangerous than a more predictable

foe, since each cell responds differently to similar situations.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The Cult of the Dragon boasts as its chief strengths powerful

allies and its members fanatical devotion to the cause. Its rela-

tively small membership, however, often hampers its ability to

effectively accomplish its goals. In addition, the chaotic nature

of many of the cultists makes them unpredictable, which can

be both a blessing and a curse.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Wizards  of  the  Cult  of  the  Dragon  use  the  standard  equip-

ment and ability scores presented in the DUNGEON MASTERs

SPECIAL ITEMS AND SUPERNATURAL

ABILITIES

The  Cult  of  the  Dragon  possesses  a  sacred  book,  written  by

Sammaster  First-Speaker  himself,  entitled  Tome  of  the

Dragon. The tome is a thick stack of vellum pages bound to-

gether inside a cover made of cured red dragon hide. The Cult

symbol appears in gilt on the front cover. The original copy

The Cult of the Dragon

contains details on all the insane archmages research in creat-

ing dracoliches. It also holds the complete text of his prophe-

cies  regarding  the  fate  of  Toril,  the  reign  of  the  undead

dragons,  and  the  role  of  the  Cult  in  administering  the  new

world  order.  Moreover,  it  holds  all  the  Players  Handbook

spells from the school of Necromancy, and details the process

that must be followed to turn a dragon into a dracolich (see

the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting).

The  book  is  written  in  a  cipher  invented  by  Sammaster.

The  solution  to  the  code  is  one  of  the  Cults  most  closely

guarded secrets, and only the Wearers of Purple are permitted

to learn it. The Cult has made several copies of the original,

and most cells have their own copy kept in the possession of

its Wearer of Purple. All members of the Cult are expected to

guard their cells copy of Tome of the Dragon with their lives,

if necessary.

The Well of Dragons

Members: Nearly 350 (including servants).

Leader: Naergoth Bladelord.

In the wilderness southeast of the Battle of Bones rises the life-

less caldera of a long-extinct volcano. Within its hollow depths

lies  the  place  at  which  legends  have  long  hinted:  a  dragon

graveyard, where the great beasts go to perish when their time

is  nigh.  It  is  a  grim  sight,  lined  with  countless  thousands  of

dragon bones bleached white by time. But to a member of the

Cult, this is a vision of beauty, for the graveyard is a veritable

treasure trove for those who worship undead dragons.

As noted in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, the

Cult of the Dragon discovered this site only recently, and it ac-

quired possession after releasing the undead dragon guardian.

However,  though  it  has  sent  a  number  of  cultists  and  much

material to the place, it has not thus far been able to enjoy its

windfall.  The  Cult  is  not  the  only  organization  interested  in

looting the treasures that lie in the volcanos hollow interior.

Though  the  Cult  is  building  a  fortress  to  guard  the  Well  of

Dragons  from  rivals,  the  work  proceeds  slowly  due  to  the

nearly  constant  obstruction  from  intruders.  Fending  off  the

interference of adventurers, archmages, dragons who object to

the Cults activities, and a host of other interests isnt easy, but

the  Cult  members  stationed  there  have  so  far  managed  to

grimly defend their foothold.

This  location  is  a  series  of  natural  caverns,  together  with

some hastily built chambers, in a nearby area of the volcano. It

serves as a temporary headquarters for the commander of the

fortress.  While  the  work  progresses  above,  the  commander

spends much of his time in his rooms below, directing his min-

ions  who  in  turn  supervise  the  laborers  building  the  strong-

hold. Roughly three hundred fifty cultists are assigned to this

project, including servants. Mostabout two hundred fifty

are laborers and craftsfolk who are working frantically to raise

the  fortress  so  that  the  Well  of  Dragons  can  be  protected

against  intruders.  The  work  would  certainly  go  faster  if  the

Cult  hired  outside  labor,  but  it  fears  the  breach  in  secrecy.

Better  to  finish  the  task  somewhat  slowly,  the  Wearers  of

Purple reason, than risk spreading all over Faern the knowl-

edge of what is happening here. Of the remaining one hundred,

about twenty are lesser mages who defend the site against un-

wanted eyes and interlopers. About seventy are servants who

keep the laborers fed, clothed, and supplied, and the remainder

are Wearers of Purple assigned to help guard the site and begin

cataloguing  its  treasures.  The  cultists  assigned  to  raise  the

secret fortress that will soon become the Cults new headquar-

ters are among the most devoted of its members.

Naergoth Bladelord, inarguably the Cults most powerful

warlord (CE male human Ftr18), oversees the entire enter-

prise. The Wearers of Purple assigned him the command of

the construction project when it became clear that somebody

would have to defend it. Naergoth was previously attached to

a  large  Cult  cell  in  Sembia,  where  he  and  his  soldiers  pro-

tected  various  illegal  Cult  activities.  He  doesnt  much  care

for this assignment, however: The Wearers of Purple are too

paranoid about discovery to hire a proper-sized construction

crew, and there hasnt been time for a sufficient number of

soldiers  to  be  assigned  to  the  place.  Naergoth  feels  exposed

and vulnerable, and he spends a lot of his time trying to con-

vince the Wearers of Purple to hire a mercenary company to

help  him  fend  off  intruders.  Thus  far,  the  senior  Cultists

present at the site have preferred to rely on their spells and

those of their lesser mages to repel interlopers. This strategy

has worked so far, but the Cult has lost some members in the

process.

Unknown to Naergoth, help is on the way. The Wearers of

Purple  have  summoned  aid  from  Arsekaslyx,  a  mature  red

dragon that the Cult has been cooperating with for years. They

anticipate her arrival any day now, and hope that her presence

enables the laborers to finish the fortress without the need to

import more workers or soldiers.

Only the commander, his aide, and several of his soldiers

are  quartered  here.  The  Wearers  of  Purple  have  already

moved  into  makeshift  quarters  in  the  unfinished  fortress

above,  the  better  to  defend  it.  Most  of  them  visit  the  com-

mander (who is starting to wonder just what hes in command

of) at least once a day.

LAYOUT OF THE WELL OF DRAGONS

This location is reached by a wide natural cavern that exits the

main  dragon  graveyard  in  the  hollow  volcano  interior,  run-

ning  for  about  200  yards  southeast  at  a  downward  angle  of

about 15 degrees. Unless noted otherwise, metal braziers that

servants keep filled and stoked light all the rooms of the com-

plex.  The  structure  itself  is  natural  stone,  worked  in  some

places to create rooms and chambers.

1. Tunnel Entrance

A pair of the commanders soldiers (LE humans Ftr2) stand

guard  at  all  times,  forbidding  entrance  to  any  except  those

they recognize and who have legitimate business with the com-

mander. They have orders to question everyone who comes this

way,  even  if  known  to  them,  and  to  ask  for  the  password,

which is changed daily. If anyone approaching fails to give the

password, the guards raise the alarm by blowing their horns.

Raising and blowing the horn is a move-equivalent action. The

horn  is  heard  throughout  the  complex.  Anyone  approaching

the  complex  from  this  area  can  hear  the  sound  of  running

water  directly  ahead  (the  sound  is  made  by  the  underground

stream, area 16).

The Cult of the Dragon

2. Storeroom

This small room is only partially finished: The walls and ceil-

ing  still  bear  visible  gouges  and  marks  where  the  cultists

hacked  away  stone  to  create  the  room.  It  is  piled  high  with

boxes of dry biscuits, barrels of water and wine, sacks of flour,

beans, and rice, and bags of similar items.

3. Trap

A  threadbare  woolen  rug  has  been  thrown  over  the  floor  of

this vestibule. Worked into the rugs pattern is the faded image

of a red dragon, wings spread, breathing a gout of flame as it

hovers above a tiny farming community. The half-dozen build-

ings in the picture are all ablaze, as are the nearby crops and

haystacks. Panicked little people run out of their houses. The

rug itself smells strange, exuding an odor more reminiscent of

a pine forest than a big square of wool.

Trap: The  10-foot-square  rug  is  guarded  by  a  glyph  of

warding triggered  by  any  nonevil  creature  that  enters  the

area. The blast ignites the rug (which is coated with pitch) and

deals 5d8 points of fire damage to the character who stepped

on the rug and anyone within 5 feet of him or her. The rug

burns  for  1  round  following  the  explosion.  All  creatures

standing  on  the  rug  or  within  5  feet  of  the  rug  take  2d6

points  of  fire  damage.  Activating  the  trap  makes  sufficient

noise to draw the attention of everyone in the complex who is

not in areas 12, 13, or 14.

Glyph of Warding: CR 3; 5-ft. fire blast (5d8); Reflex half

(DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

Burning Rug Trap: CR 3; +5 ranged touch attack (2d6 fire);

Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 28).

4. Armory

This room stores the armor, weapons, and personal gear of the

complexs guards. The weapons and armor here include swords,

axes,  daggers,  crossbows,  and  suits  of  chainmail  and  studded

leather armor, none of it magical.

5. Servants Quarters

Four servants (NE humans Com1) who serve the commander

and his staff are housed in this room. The only items in the

room are the servants ordinary personal effects.

6. Guardroom

Two of the commanders soldiers (NE humans Ftr2) are sta-

tioned here at all times. Their orders are to stop and question

everyone who approaches, even if the guards recognize them,

and to halt anyone lacking legitimate business with the com-

mander.  They  request  the  daily  password,  and  if  it  is  not

forthcoming  one  soldier  attacks  while  the  other  blows  his

warning horn.

7. Guards Quarters

This is the sleeping quarters for eight Cult soldiers (NE or LE

humans Ftr2). The area has four bunk beds set against the walls,

a small wooden stand containing a ceramic washbasin, a cham-

ber pot in one corner, and the guards personal effects.

8. Aides Quarters

This is the quarters of Klaram (NE male human Ftr10), the

commanders  aide-de-camp.  He  is  responsible  for  seeing  to  it

that the commanders orders are carried out, arranging for the

daily  password,  acting  as  the  commanders  liaison  with  the

Wearers  of  Purple,  and  overseeing  the  sites  overall  progress

while  the  commander  works  on  plans  to  defend  it  from  in-

truders. Klaram is a mercenary who has been with the Cult for

three years. The room holds his bed, a writing desk, a chair, and

a packing crate that doubles as a footlocker. The crate is locked

with  an  average  lock  (Open  Lock  DC  25),  and  contains

Klarams personal effects as well as three potions of cure mod-

erate wounds and the aides password book. This is a slim book

cheaply bound in cowhide that contains columns of hundreds

of words, all written in a neat, plain script. A check mark next

to a word indicates that it has been used as a password. Klaram

appears to be using the words in order.

9. Commanders Quarters

This is the personal chamber of the commander of the site.

When not among the Wearers of Purple trying to turn them

to his point of view or observing in frustration while the work

on the fortress slowly continues, Naergoth can be found here

writing in his log or reviewing his aides reports. Within the

room  is  a  bed  (somewhat  larger  than  the  other  beds  in  the

complex), a writing desk and chair, a washbasin, and a wooden

chest reinforced with brass fittings. The chest is locked with

an average lock (Open Lock DC 25). The chest contains the

commanders personal effects, plus a number of his old cam-

paign logs.

Naergoth: Male  human  Ftr18;  CR  18;  Medium-size  hu-

manoid; HD 18d10+75; hp 174; Init +1; Spd 20; AC 23 (touch

11,  flat-footed  10);  Atk  +27/+22/+17/+12  melee  (1d0+10/

Possessions: +4 bastard sword of wounding, +2 mighty com-

posite longbow (+4 Str bonus), masterwork full plate, potion of

heroism, quiver of Ehlonna, ring of protection +4.

10. Unfinished Room

Only one wall of this room is finished, giving it a rather lop-

sided  appearance.  The  room  is  crammed  with  furniture  that

presumably will be put to good use when the fortress is finished:

chairs, chests, bookshelves, writing desks, and a long oak table.

11. Holding Cell

Unlike the other parts of the complex, this room is unlit, and it

reeks of sweat, blood, and despair. Six iron pillars, each 6 inches

in  diameter,  have  been  hastily  erected  in  this  chamber  and

bolted to the floor and ceiling. A pair of shackles has been fas-

tened to each pillar. Most of the shackles are empty but coated

with dried blood and bits of desiccated skin. Two prisoners who

26

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/24/01  8:32 AM  Page 27

The Cult of the Dragon

attempted to spy on the progress of the fortress but were spot-

ted and captured occupy the center pillars.

One  prisoner  is  Nevrizil,  a  Zhentarim  agent  (LE  male

human  Rog3).  The  other  is  Avarra  of  Battledale,  a  Harper

agent  (CG  female  half-elf  Rgr2).  Both  have  been  beaten,

gagged,  and  shackled  here  to  await  further  mistreatment  at

the hands of the commander and the wizards. Nevrizil claims

to  be  a  merchant  who  got  separated  from  his  caravan  and

wandered into the area by mistake. Avarra admits to being a

ranger, but keeps her tie to the Harpers a secret until she is

sure that any rescuers are not in league with the Cult.

12. Chamber of Ascendance

When the cultists moved in to take over the Well of Dragons,

they first outfitted this area as a makeshift staging ground for

any  dragon  that  might  become  a  Sacred  One  before  the

fortress is finished. While some might question the Cults pri-

orities, it made sense to the Wearers of Purple to be ready for

the contingency. This immense cavern is ideal for the task, be-

cause it is open to the sky above via an old lava tube that rises

above the newly made pond (area 14), offering easy access for

a dragon. The cavern ceiling is 40 feet high. During daylight

hours, the light filtering down through the open shaft dimly

lights the cavern. At night the area is lit by braziers placed on

the great platform (area 13).

13. Great Platform

Constructed from massive limestone blocks hauled down here

by  the  laborers,  this  huge  stage  is  meant  to  hold  a  dragon

awaiting transformation during its final moments. Four short

flights of stairs offer the cultists convenient access to the plat-

forms surface, which is 5 feet above the cavern floor.

14. Underground Pond

Thinking  that  any  visiting  dragon,  or  potential  Sacred  One,

may  wish  to  drink  or  bathe  conveniently,  the  Wearers  of

Purple ordered the construction of this shallow pond. Laborers

piled limestone blocks across the stream (area 15) to dam up

the flow, causing this part of the cavern to flood. The pond is

icy cold and about 7 feet deep in the center. Above, a vacated

lava tube left over from the volcanos active period twists and

turns its way up to the surface, about 65 feet above.

15. Limestone Dam

Limestone blocks have been used to dam the flow of the un-

derground stream. A sluice cut into the dams center allows the

stream to continue moving, slowly, along its course. The sluice

can be plugged with a limestone block to stop the flow entirely.

16. Underground Stream

The stream continues its slow meander through the rock, pass-

ing from here through a hole in the cave floor and ultimately

emerging on the surface on the volcanos southern flank.

The Drow

The Drow

Orlpar Eveningfalls group was ready. His swords were sharp.

Kerri  had  prepared  a  dozen  spells  to  deal  with  spiders  and

poison.  Dalabrac  wore  a  cloak  of  arachnida  and  carried  a

wand of daylight. Mehmen had prepared his most potent battle-

magic. They set foot in Cormanthor with the intent to slay.

It was time to strike against the invaders of Orlpars home-

land.  The  drow.  Worshipers  of  Araushnee,  Lolth,  the  Spider

Queen.  The  very  thought  of  dark  elves  living  in  the  ancestral

homes of his people sickened him. He and his allies would drive

them out of the elven trees and force them back into the Under-

dark where they belonged, or kill them where they stood.

When the attack came, they were prepared. Kerri cast her

wards against vermin, Mehmen launched a fireball, and Dal-

abracs wand lit the night like it was noon.

It all went horribly wrong. No spiders were seen. The drow

rolled  from  the  fire  unscathed.  They  ignored  the  daylight.

Hails  of  crossbow  bolts  felled  all  three  of  his  allies  before

Orlpar had a chance to strike once. Half a dozen bolts pierced

his skin, and he fell, barely able to keep his eyes open. A moment

later,  he  was  surrounded.  I  curse  you  and  your  dark  deity,

drow, he whispered, coughing blood.

Little elven fool, hissed the dark elf. I spit on the Spider

Queen.

A crossbow bolt in the eye ended Orlpars puzzlement.

No longer a threat only in the Underdark, the dark elves of

Faern  now  prowl  about  the  surface  to  work  their  evil  or

simply to survive. Adventurers are discovering them in large

numbers in the old elven lands, particularly Cormanthor, and

they are not what the legends tell. While many worship Lolth

the Spider Queen, some have come to the surface to escape the

oppression and insane conflicts of the cities she controls, and

these  turn  to  other  deities  of  the  drow  pantheon  or  (more

rarely)  deities  of  the  surface  world.  Some  of  these  drow  still

hold the drive to conquer and enslave the sunlit lands, while

others just wish to be left alone in their new homeland.

Brief History

Over ten thousand years ago, dark-skinned elves of the nation

of Illythiir fell under the sway of evil deities and attacked the

benign elven nations. Eventually the Seldarine, the deities of

the elves, intervened in these great battles, transforming the

Illythiiri and other dark elves into black-skinned, white-haired

creatures that could not stand the light of the sun. These crea-

tures, called dhaeraow (traitor) by the other elves, fled into

the  Underdark,  warred  against  each  other,  and  occasionally

attacked  their  surface  kin  and  anyone  else  who  got  in  their

way.

This situation persisted for thousands of years, with drow of

different philosophies and faiths forming city-states in the im-

mense  caverns  underground.  On  the  surface,  the  other  elves

suffered setbacks at the hands of dragons, evil humanoids, and

the  advancement  of  human  civilizations.  Eventually,  the

elven leaders decided that the elves would be best suited by a

secure  homeland  that  no  nonelf  could  enter  or  ever  harm.

Thus the Elven Retreat was called, and elves from all over the

world used portals and mundane means to travel to Evermeet.

This abandoning of old elven strongholds did not go unno-

ticed.  Rebel  groups  of  drow,  dissatisfied  noble  houses,  and

raiders  from  underground  cities  all  found  fewer  and  fewer

elves to fight on the surface near the closest tunnels to the Un-

derdark.  Some  decided  to  stay  aboveground,  feeling  that  the

constant  pressure  for  survival  would  be  relaxed  in  a  world

where food, water, and space were abundant. It is these drow

who now pose a threat to the surface world. These drow have

begun to adapt to life on the surface. Some can tolerate sun-

light.  Many  have  chosen  homes  to  own  and  defend,  while

others see their surface lairs as much better launching points

for their attacks on their ancient enemies.

the Organization

the Underdark.

Headquarters: Cormanthor on the surface, various cities in

Members: Estimated  15,000  living  on  the  surface,  un-

known tens of thousands in the Underdark.

Hierarchy: Varies by group (usually militaristic).

Leader: Varies by group.

Religion: Drow pantheon (varies by group).

Alignment: NE, CE, CN.

Secrecy: Low.

Symbol: No  one  symbol  represents  the  surface  drow  as  a

whole. Their tendency to divide into factions prevents any one

symbol from representing them. They usually are identified by

house runes, stylized combinations of symbols barely recog-

nizable  as  Espruar.  Underdark  drow  still  tend  to  wear  the

spider symbol of Lolth more than any other.

As a whole, the drow tend to organize themselves among mili-

taristic lines. Since much of their lives is devoted to combat and

all drow are indoctrinated from birth to hate their racial ene-

mies, the surface elves, a military hierarchy is an easy pattern

to fall into. Quite often, the upper levels of an organization are

linked by family, with a noble house being the most common

unit of this type. These groups usually have a militaristic for-

mation  underlying  the  bonds  of  blood.  Houses  ruled  in  this

manner are not necessarily affectionate; a drow often fears his

own  family  more  than  any  outsider,  for  a  family  member

knows  your  weaknesses  and  knows  when  you  rest.  While  this

level of caution is normal among most drow groups, among the

followers of Lolth it is heightened to a level of extreme para-

noia, since she encourages her servants to betray each other in

the interest of weeding out the weak.

HIERARCHY

Purely military organizations are led by individuals both pow-

erful  and  respected  by  the  lesser  members  of  the  group.  In

groups of one hundred or more, this leader is always at least

10th level. The leader is usually a spellcaster of some sort, and

among many groups the leader is a cleric of a drow deity, with

that deity worshiped by all drow in the group. Only rarely, or

in  more  egalitarian  groups,  are  different  deities  openly  wor-

shiped by different members.

Those drow groups organized by family tend to have one or

more  charismatic  individuals  at  the  top  who  command  the

others  by  persuasion,  manipulation,  and  leverage  through

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/24/01  8:34 AM  Page 29

The Drow

favors. If more than one person is in command, each is usually

equal to the others in power, a balance carefully maintained by

tenuous alliances and veiled threats.

Because  the  drow  live  in  a  near-constant  state  of  warfare

and  are  not  above  eliminating  their  own  rivals  through

murder, the leaders of a group of drow can change in a fairly

short amount of time. However, since the drow live long lives,

they are patient enough to hoard and ready their own power,

waiting to strike when their rival is weakest.

DROW DEITIES

The  role  that  the  drow  pantheon  plays  in  the  attitude  and

nature of a group of drow necessitates a short discussion of the

drow deities.

Eilistraee

Daughter of Lolth and the only good member of the drow

pantheon, Eilistraee encourages her followers to treat others

with  kindness  and  avoid  the  senseless  and  genocidal  wars

that  the  other  drow  seem  to  enjoy.  The  remainder  of  this

section of the book assumes the group in question does not

follow the Dark Maiden, for she would not tolerate such evil

from her followers.

Ghaunadaur

An ancient deity that predates Lolths fall, the entity known

as  That  Which  Lurks  rules  over  oozes  and  other  semiamor-

phous monsters such as gibbering mouthers, ghaunadans, and

ropers. It hates Lolth, and its worshipers are required to slay

her  followers  and  steal  their  items  and  knowledge.  It  enjoys

sacrifices and rewards those who break from the norm to ex-

plore  strange  pursuits.  Ghaunadaur  is  a  bizarre,  alien  entity

that communicates only in simple terms, despite its great in-

telligence.  Groups  that  worship  it  tend  to  be  smaller  (since

many  members  offer  themselves  as  sacrifices  before  they

reach  middle  age)  and  are  sometimes  accompanied  by  oozes

and other monsters it favors, which are guided and controlled

by its clerics and druids. Some believe that Ghaunadaur is being

courted by Umberlee, who seeks to expand her power onto the

land  and  holds  a  common  interest  in  jellyfish  and  other

strange creatures.

Kiaransalee

An  ascended  mortal  necromancer  from  another  plane,

Kiaransalee chafes under Lolths rule and hopes to eventually

destroy her. She is allied with Malar and Velsharoon, and tries

to balance the interests of these two deities in order to preserve

her  own  power.  As  a  deity  of  vengeance,  she  has  a  long

memory and crafts plans of retribution years in the making.

She has few worshipers, and not many of them are on the sur-

face, since they prefer the solitude of the Underdark and gen-

erally  share  the  sun-hating  feelings  of  most  undead.  Groups

that worship her are usually accompanied by undead, including

bonebats and revenants.

Lolth

The zealous followers of Lolth control the most drow terri-

tory in the Underdark. The Queen of the Demonweb Pits en-

courages her followers to war on each other and oppresses all

males, making her a poor choice for honest worship by half

the drow in the Underdark. She enjoys their self-destructive

battles far too much to have them devote themselves to con-

quering  the  surface,  and  so  any  Lolth-worshiping  drow

found  aboveground  are  usually  simple  raiding  parties  with

no  incentive  to  stay  if  faced  with  superior  force.  They  at-

tempt  to  inflict  as  much  damage  as  possible,  especially  to

elves and elven communities, before retreating. Raiding par-

ties with powerful clerics or otherwise favored by Lolth are

sometimes  accompanied  by  draegloths,  myrlochars,  sword

spiders, or yochlols.

Selvetarm

Selvetarm is the son of Vhaeraun and a forgotten elven deity.

He  wandered  for  a  time  between  darkness  and  light  before

being  tricked  by  Lolth  into  defeating  and  absorbing  the

essence of a powerful spider demon, which turned him fully to

evil. He now exists as a ruthless being obsessed with war and

combat.  Selvetarm  is  fully  subservient  to  Lolth  and  has  few

worshipers  outside  Eryndlyn  (located  beneath  the  High

Moor), the one city that venerates both deities. His worshipers

support those of Lolth and are either very skilled and deter-

mined fighters or reckless barbarians. He has drawn the atten-

tion of Garagos, who might try to steal his power. This in turn

has attracted the eye of Tempus, who would want to prevent

such a power struggle.

Vhaeraun

Vhaeraun,  the  Masked  Lord,  drow  deity  of  thievery  and

evil  activity  on  the  surface,  is  the  most  prominent  drow

deity  among  the  surface-dwelling  drow.  The  son  of  Lolth

and Corellon Larethian, he wishes to cast off the shackles

that  his  mother  has  placed  upon  the  drow  so  they  may

forcibly reclaim their birthright in the surface lands, which

they  call  the  Night  Above.  Vhaerauns  followers  are  sur-

vivors  who  managed  to  escape  the  tyranny  of  Lolths

female  clerics  and  eventually  find  a  home  for  themselves

on the surface. His followers are skilled at stealth and ob-

serving others, having honed these skills under the gaze of

the Spider Queen.

Followers of the Masked Lord are encouraged to form sur-

face communities and (in some groups, such as the Auzkovyn

clan) even intermarry with surface elves of similar tempera-

ment,  for  Vhaeraun  believes  that  the  various  elven  races

should stand together to advance the race as a whole. This at-

titude is tempered by his vehement insistence that all dwar-

ven and gnome races should be avoided. Almost all his clerics

are male, the few exceptions being worshipers of other drow

deities  who  converted  to  his  faith.  Vhaerauns  followers  are

the most likely of all the surface drow to agree to aid others

in  the  destruction  of  Lolth-worshipers,  and  they  suffer  the

least from the fractious infighting often seen in other groups.

Deep  dragons,  yeth  hounds,  and  undead  shadows  sometimes

accompany them.

Because Vhaeraun has thievery as part of his portfolio and

resembles the deity Mask in many ways, Mask has taken an in-

terest in Vhaeraun and may attempt to steal or absorb Vhaer-

auns  power  in  an  attempt  to  make  up  for  the  parts  of  his

portfolio that were lost to Cyric.

The Drow

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

Primarily, the drow on the surface wish to survive. After cen-

turies  of  living  in  a  harsh  subterranean  environment,  they

have moved to a place where food and water are plentiful and

predators are more easily recognized. No longer do they have

to  cluster  in  great  cities  that  become  pits  of  corruption,  op-

pression, and despair. Now they can spread out and sample the

strange delights of the surface world.

With the basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter easily

satisfied, the drow began to pursue their long-term agenda of

world domination and destruction of their enemies, the surface

elves. However, some groups (such as the worshipers of Vhaer-

aun,  and  especially  the  Auzkovyn  clan  of  Cormanthor)  have

abandoned their traditional racial hatred, and among the set-

tled surface drow these elves are actually a majority.

The largest group of drow on the surface is the followers of

House  Jaelre.  The  leaders  of  this  group  have  established

smaller, finite goals for themselves. Rather than having a dis-

organized  plan  to  take  over  the  world  or  destroy  all  its  ene-

mies,  House  Jaelre  plans  to  take  over  old  elven  settlements

(particularly the old Elven Court in Cormanthor), study the

mythals and remnants of elven high magic, and find a way to

tune these powerful wards to not only keep out enemies from

the  surface,  but  to  repel  any  enemy  drow  who  might  try  to

take their prize from them. To distract people from its activi-

ties  in  the  Elven  Court,  House  Jaelre  executes  precise  and

small-scale raids upon parts of the Dales. These strikes occur in

places  far  from  the  Elven  Court,  so  when  the  Dalesfolk  are

sufficiently agitated to send militias and adventurers in search

of the drow, they never connect the attacks with the location

of  the  Elven  Court,  and  often  end  up  fighting  enemies  of

House Jaelre, such as raiding parties of Lolth-worshipers. Of

course, if the house has a chance to eliminate such a raiding

party itself at little or no risk, it takes the opportunity, which

is why some adventurers find small groups of drow bodies bear-

ing symbols of the Spider Queen.

House Jaelre is led by four drow: Jezz the Lame (NE male

drow  Rog6/Sor6),  Belarbreeza  (NE  female  drow  Wiz14),

Tebryn  (male  drow  Ftr5/Rog5),  and  Nurkinyan  (NE  male

drow Clr14 of Vhaeraun). Jezz leads the raiding parties that

distract the outside world from the houses true activities. Be-

larbreeza leads a team of drow mages in unlocking the secrets

of the mythals. Tebryn is the leader of the military forces that

guard the inner drow strongholds, and Nurkinyan is the spiri-

tual leader of the house and nominally the leader to whom the

other three report.

RECRUITING

Since  drow  are  defined  by  their  racial  identity,  a  nondrow

cannot become a drow without the use of magic. However, the

dark elves often have servitor creatures or slaves. While techni-

cally these creatures arent recruits, they are the closest most of

these groups come to actual recruiting. The exceptions are some

of the Vhaeraun-worshiping drow, such as the Auzkovyn clan,

which are willing to accept elves, half-elves, and even humans

who share their patron as full members within their ranks.

ALLIES

Other than slaves and servitor creatures, the drow have few

allies.  Strangely  enough,  their  most  common  allies  are  also

their  most  frequent  rivalsother  powerful  creatures  of  the

Underdark, particularly mind flayers (valuable for their abil-

ity to read enemy minds) and duergar (who produce excellent

weapons  and  send  caravans  all  over  the  Underdark  to  sell

them). The svirfneblin, however, never ally with the drow.

In addition to the above and the allied creatures mentioned

in the section on drow deities, groups of drow often have pet

night hunter bats. The dark elves are sometimes aided by air,

dust, and earth mephits, and even shadow dragons. Drow slaves

are usually humanoids of various kinds and are rarely used in

combat, since the surface drow dont trust their armed slaves

not to run away at the first opportunity.

ENEMIES

Drow have a deserved reputation as murderers, raiders, and

slavers, creatures evil to the core. Any person living outside

the  Underdark  tends  to  automatically  fear  and  hate  any

dark elf.

No surface creatures hate the drow more than other elves.

Elven  stories  tell  of  Araushnees  betrayal  and  her  attack  on

the  Seldarine,  the  drows  instigation  of  the  Crown  Wars

(whether this is true or not), and horrible acts committed by

drow raiders against elven communities. Even the most open-

minded and tolerant elf has a hard time accepting the presence

of a drow, even one who claims to be good and whose good can

be verified (magic can disguise much, after all). After millen-

nia of indoctrination, the elves have a hatred for the drow that

approaches obsession.

The drow are also opposed by Underdark creatures such as

derro,  duergar,  kuo-toas,  mind  flayers,  and  svirfneblin.  As  a

whole  these  creatures  see  drow  as  a  great  threat  because  of

their magic and numbers. Of course, the greatest enemy of a

group of drow is a rival group, and the wars between the drow

houses and cities have shaped the social and economic nature

of the Underdark for thousands of years.

Drow  are  hated  and  feared  by  almost  every  creature  that

knows of their existence. Good beings tend to attack at the first

chance. Even groups of rival drow are likely to attack, particu-

larly if one of the groups worships Lolth and another doesnt.

Other subraces of elves, no matter what alignment, react nega-

tively  to  their  fallen  kin,  and  most  other  good  creatures  feel

that  anything  a  true  elf  wants  to  kill  is  probably  something

very wicked indeed.

Drow personality

To nondrow, every dark elf seems menacing, sneaky, cruel,

mysterious,  and  very  powerful.  The  truth  is  that  most

dark elves are this way, and the typical drow attitude does-

nt change much depending upon what classes the charac-

ter  holds.  A  drow  cleric  has  these  traits  because  of  the

teachings of his or her deity. A fighters or rogues skill is

the basis for these feelings. A wizards personal power cre-

ates this attitude. Because of their training and familiarity

with each others abilities, a group of drow work extremely

well as a unit, including presenting a united front in terms

of personality.

The Drow

Encounters

Drow  on  the  surface  prefer  to  be  mobile,  traveling  in  small

groups that are less likely to be spotted. Only when an entire

settlement is relocating do they move in large numbers, and

even then they rarely exceed one hundred per group. A typical

drow  patrol  is  four  to  six  individuals  (one  cleric,  one  or  two

fighters,  one  or  two  rogues,  and  one  wizard);  a  typical  drow

strike force is two to three times that many.

Drow patrols on the surface are usually looking for intrud-

ers, investigating another patrols report, or hunting. A strike

force exists only to kill, usually created to rid its territory of a

specific threat or eradicate a rival patrol or strike force.

The  groups  described  below  are  drow  patrols.  To  create  a

strike force, double the number of nonclerics and add 2 to the

EL or triple the number and add 3 to the EL. Clerics may be

of any of the drow deities; in Cormanthor, the clerics are usu-

ally worshipers of Lolth or Vhaeraun. In a patrol or a strike

force, the cleric is typically the group leader.

SPELL-LIKE OR SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES

The drow have three spell-like abilities that they use to their

great advantage. While they have no need for light in most cir-

cumstances,  the  dancing  lights spell  can  provide  a  handy  dis-

traction, such as by drawing attention to the opposite side of

camp at night, presenting a strange glowing figure that might

be confused for an undead creature, or even scaring away fools

with the appearance of a will-o-wisp. Some particularly corrupt

drow  have  been  known  to  team  up  with  a  will-o-wisp,  using

their dancing lights to drive prey into the aberrations lair.

Drow  use  their  darkness ability  to  cut  off  lines  of  escape,

negate enemy light spells, or to set traps. A drow ambush in a

known  section  of  tunnel  might  consist  of  a  20-foot-deep  pit

with a darkness spell at the bottom of it. Creatures approaching

the pit might not notice the darkness, thinking it only a section

of dark stone. Drow fighters with the Blind-Fight feat cast the

darkness upon themselves, then enter melee against opponents

that are effectively blind. The drow are especially fond of using

darkness to thwart spellcasters, who usually must be able to see

a target to cast a spell at it. In large or open areas, the drow

have  been  known  to  use  multiple  darkness spells  around  a

group of enemies to funnel them in a particular direction, such

as toward a waiting group of drow crossbowmen.

Faerie fire is used to illuminate and decorate parts of drow

cities. Its ability to negate concealment effects such as blur and

invisibility makes it an effective combat ability as well. If the

player characters ever fight drow while invisible, one or more

drow are going to use faerie fire to dispose of the heroes advan-

tage. Faerie fire is also used as a signal or code, with different

colors  indicating  different  information.  Blue  indicates  a  weak-

appearing group approaching, violet means a person has been in-

jured, and so on. Faerie fire can also be used in a passive manner

or as a lure, drawing visitors to something the drow want them

to see or away from something they dont.

COMBAT AND TACTICS

The drow do not attack in a haphazard fashion. Each drow knows

his or her role in a fight and sticks to it. Fighters always move to

flank, allowing rogues to sneak attack, spellcasters target enemy

spellcasters with silence and destructive spells, and so on. Drow use

terrain to their advantage. When preparing an ambush they learn

every detail of the location, and (if possible) they discuss what

tactics their enemies might use and places they might move to.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The drow are intelligent and quick. They have natural magical

powers,  strong  spell  resistance,  and  a  mindset  that  sees  most

other  creatures  as  enemies  or  potential  slaves.  In  an  environ-

ment where survival is difficult, their skills have been honed to

a degree rarely seen on the surface world. Drow recognize power

and know how to use it.

The  greatest  weaknesses  of  the  drow  are  their  physical

frailty,  sensitivity  to  light,  and  distinctive  appearance.  They

avoid melee combat if at all possible, relying on their superior

ranged  attacks  and  ability  to  hide.  If  forced  into  a  situation

where they have to fight in melee, they are likely to retreat to

a safer position where they can rely on their strengths.

The drows sensitivity to light makes it difficult for them to op-

erate during daylight hours. Unlike humans, who can bring torches

to  light  the  night  and  expand  their  normal  hours  of  operation,

drow cannot darken the daylight enough to negate the pain the

sun causes them, limiting what they can do in any 24-hour period.

Because their reputation precedes them, drow are accustomed

to  being  attacked  on  sight.  This  means  the  drow  have  to  rely

upon their own resources, putting them at a disadvantage com-

pared to other evil groups. The members of the Zhentarim or

the clerics of Cyric can enter a Red Wizard enclave and purchase

items at a discount, but even if the Thayans are willing to trade

with the drow, the host city probably wont tolerate them.

The followers of Lolth have an additional weakness: the many

rival  houses  and  factions  within  their  own  cities.  For  example,

one of Lolths raiders has to fear not only her enemies on the

surface, but also whether the groups wizard is planning to sell

the raiders into slavery to a mind flayer, if the cleric plans to sac-

rifice the raiders to Lolth if they dont perform to her expecta-

tions, or if her own cousin is going to stab her in the back during

the confusion of battle. These worries cause many drow to leave

the cities of Lolth and join surface clans, team up with merce-

naries, or become loners in the strange world under the sun.

The Drow

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

As beings from a bizarre and evil culture, the drow tend to be

equipped with strange and unusual magic items. While clerics

and wizards have items almost the same as those presented in

the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide, the  equipment  for  fighters

and rogues differs greatly from the standard NPC equipment

in that book. Use the accompanying tables when creating drow

fighter or rogue NPCs. These listings include the bonus equip-

ment for having a preferred class.

SPECIAL SPELLS AND MAGIC ITEMS

Some of the unusual magic items often found in the hands of

the  drow  are  fire  elemental  gems,  drow  house  insignia,  pi-

wafwis (lesser and greater), and rings of antivenom. See the ap-

pendix for details.

Darkmask Prestige Class

Most of the surface drow worship Vhaeraun. Some strike a bal-

ance between their faith and their skills at stealth, becoming a

specialized  sort  of  cleric/rogue  called  a  darkmask.  The  dark-

masks are the elite of Vhaerauns clergy, and they are called

upon to handle very special missions for the Masked Lord.

A  darkmask  is  a  divine  spellcaster  skilled  in  the  arts  of

hiding,  sneaking,  and  stealing.  Mysterious  and  secretive,  the

darkmasks are the enigmatic special agents of Vhaeraun, flit-

ting from place to place under the shadow of night to enact

the will of Vhaeraun. They usually wear black masks and favor

shades of black and gray in their clothing.

Most darkmasks have levels in rogue and cleric, but a few

rangers and ranger/clerics have heeded the call of Vhaeraun.

Very  few  arcane  spellcasters  become  darkmasks,  choosing  to

develop their powers along different lines.

Darkmasks rarely work together, although a rumor is circu-

lating about one group of drow in Cormanthor that is led by

four darkmasks of equal power. This group has no permanent

camp and spends most of its time hunting Lolth raiders who

come to the surface.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a darkmask, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Blank Shot; 9th, Precise Shot.

Race: Drow or half-drow.

The Drow: Tips for the DM

Drow  are  some  of  the  most  talented  and  magic-proficient

creatures  in  all  Faern.  Their  sleep  arrows  carry  potent

poison and in sufficient numbers can bring down almost any

group. They focus on spellcasters first, leaving other charac-

ters for a second volley or finishing them up in melee.

The Stealthy feat means that even an average drow fighter

(Dex 12) in a chain shirt (armor check penalty 2) still has a

+1 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Given that a typ-

ical NPC drow probably has a Dexterity higher than 12 (using

the standard array and the +2 racial bonus), a group of drow

fighters  can  prepare  a  reasonably  stealthy  ambush.  When

used  by  a  rogue  or  wizard,  the  benefit  of  Stealthy  is  even

greater.

A  drow  fighter  or  rogue  with  Twin  Sword  Style  makes  a

formidable opponent despite his lighter-than-normal armor,

gaining  a  good  AC  bonus  and  the  extra  attack  from  the

second weapon.

The Daylight Adaptation feat interferes with the plans of

any adventuring group that expects all drow to react to the

sun as if they were vampires. The heroes might let their guard

down during the day, expecting drow activity only at night.

Surprise them with an attack during the middle of the day.

Because a hand crossbow and twenty masterwork bolts is

bonus equipment for drow with the proper preferred class, a

group of drow rogues within a city can strike from almost

anywhere,  sending  a  rain  of  tiny  poisoned  bolts  upon  the

heroes, then disappearing, without any bulky items to draw

attention to them (assuming they have disguised themselves

as nondrow, of course).

Above  all,  remember  that  while  the  drow  of  the  Under-

dark are constantly fighting each other, the drow of the sur-

face  rarely  do.  They  are  not  stupid  opponents,  and  are

capable  of  devious  and  long-reaching  plans  that  can  take

many game sessions to unravel.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the darkmask prestige

class. Spell-like abilities use the darkmasks divine caster level.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Darkmasks gain no profi-

ciency in weapons, armor, or shields of any type.

Spellcasting: A  darkmask  continues  training  in  divine

magic  while  practicing  his  secret  skills.  Thus,  when  a  new

darkmask level is gained, the character increases his spellcast-

ing ability as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcast-

ing class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He

does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that

class  would  have  gained  (improved  chance  of  rebuking  or

commanding undead, favored enemy, and so on). This essen-

tially means that he adds the level of darkmask to the level of

some  other  divine  spellcasting  class  the  character  has,  then

determines  spells  per  day  and  caster  level  accordingly.  If  a

character had more than one divine spellcasting class before

he became a darkmask, he must decide to which class he adds

each level of darkmask for purposes of determining spellcast-

ing when he adds the new level.

Darkfire (Sp): A darkmask can use the darkfire spell once

per day as a spell-like ability.

Pass without Trace (Sp): A darkmask can use the pass with-

out trace spell once per day as a spell-like ability.

Change Self (Sp): A darkmask of 2nd level or higher can use

the change self spell once per day as a spell-like ability.

Skill Focus (Ex): A 2nd-level darkmask gains the Skill Focus

feat, which must be applied to one of the darkmask class skills.

Dark Embrace (Su): A darkmask of 3rd level or higher has

the ability to invoke dark embrace once per day, which mani-

fests as a mask of shadow that girds the darkmasks face. The

darkmask  then  casts  a  divine  spell,  which  is  absorbed  by  the

mask  of  shadow;  the  spell  must  be  a  touch  spell  or  a  target

spell. As a free action, the darkmask may command the mask

to fly at a single creature within 100 feet, at which point that

creature is affected by the absorbed spell (saving throws and

spell resistance apply normally to the spell) and the dark em-

brace ends. The dark embrace can remain for 10 minutes. If it

vanishes before its stored spell is unleashed, the spell is lost.

Sneak Attack (Ex): A darkmask of 3rd level or higher gains

the sneak attack ability (as per the rogue class feature).

Resist  Illusions  (Ex): A  darkmask  of  4th  level  or  higher

gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against illusions.

Cloak of Shadows (Su): A darkmask of 4th level or higher

can create a cloak seemingly woven out of mundane shadows.

The cloak provides a resistance bonus on saving throws and a

profane bonus on Hide checks equal to +1 per class level of the

darkmask. The cloak lasts 1 round per class level of the dark-

mask and can be created once per day.

Bladebend (Su): This defensive ability causes the weapon of

a  single  creature  attacking  the  darkmask  to  turn  back  and

strike its wielder. The darkmask selects the target creature as a

free  action.  If  the  target  creature  attacks  the  darkmask,  it

makes an attack roll as normal, but the attack is made against

the target creatures AC, and if the attack succeeds, the target

creature suffers the damage instead of the darkmask. This abil-

ity can be activated once per day and lasts 5 rounds. It only af-

fects slashing and piercing weapons, and does not affect natu-

ral weapons of any kind.

House Jaelre

The largest group of drow in Cormanthor is House Jaelre, wor-

shipers  of  Vhaeraun  intent  on  controlling  the  abandoned

elven  mythal in  that  forest.  House  Jaelre  has  many  camps,

outposts,  and  fortresses  within  the  borders  of  Cormanthor,

some of them of surface-elf construction, others assembled by

the drow themselves. One such drow-built outpost is described

here, a place where raids into the Dales can be planned and ex-

ecuted without drawing attention to drow activity elsewhere.

Headquarters: The Elven Court, Cormanthor.

Members: Nearly 8,000.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leaders: Belarbreeza, Jezz the Lame, Nurkinyan, Tebryn.

Religion: Vhaeraun.

Secrecy: Low (although headquarters are kept secret from

people outside this faction).

OUTPOST LAYOUT

This section describes the layout of an outpost of House Jaelre in

the forest of Cormanthor. The outpost is on a low hill near a

broad stream and is built above two small entrances to the upper

Drow of House Jaelre

Underdark. House Jaelre uses this outpost as a semipermanent

base, making raids into the Dales or upon any bands of spider-

kissers  (Lolth-worshipers)  they  encounter.  The  subterranean

level of the outpost is approximately 300 feet underground.

A total of fifty drow use this as a base, with about half of

them away from the site at any time (usually patrolling the

surface or the tunnels radiating outward from the Underdark).

Half of those present are on the surface, the other half in the

level below. One-fourth of each group is likely to be in trance

or otherwise unprepared for combat (not wearing armor, and

so on), leaving about nine drow on the surface and nine under-

ground either on guard or ready to fight at a moments notice.

The drow live by finding edible plants on the surface, hunt-

ing, and harvesting edible fungi from a garden in the Underdark

portion of their lair. Supplies are brought in from other camps,

taken from slain opponents, or traded for with other groups.

The drow at this outpost include:

Valas, senior mage (NE drow male Wiz9)

Velonor, senior cleric (NE drow male Clr9 of Vhaeraun)

Ginafae, senior scout (NE drow female Rog8)

Drisinil, junior mage (NE drow female Wiz4)

Sorn, junior cleric (NE drow male Clr4 of Vhaeraun)

2 captains (NE drow Ftr5)

3 lieutenants (NE drow Ftr4)

20 scouts (NE drow Rog3)

20 soldiers (NE drow Ftr3)

In addition to the standard NPC equipment for a creature of

their class and level, each drow has one of the following: two

flasks of acid, a flask of alchemists fire, a smokestick, a tan-

glefoot bag, or a thunderstone.

SURFACE LEVEL

The  surface  portion  of  the  outpost  consists  primarily  of  a

fenced-in area 600 feet across. The 4-foot-high fence is made

of  roughly  hewn  wooden  planks  that  are  nailed  to  tree

trunks that define the perimeter of the outpost. Trees near

the outpost have been felled to provide a clearer line of sight

for lookouts as well as to provide wood and to make it im-

possible  to  enter  the  compound  simply  by  climbing  from

branch to branch.

Within the camp are a number of simple wooden shelters

made  of  rough  planks  and  built  around  one  of  the  tree

trunks.  Each  shelter  has  a  simple  wooden  door  with  a

wooden latch (no lock). Each is designed with a narrow open-

ing at the top adjacent to the tree trunk, allowing an escape

by  climbing  if  using  the  main  door  would  be  problematic.

Even  if  the  shelters  were  set  afire,  a  resident  could  easily

escape through the front door, the top opening, or even by

kicking  the  planks  apart  (Strength  check  DC  12  from  the

inside).

The trees within the camp are close enough to each other

that a person can walk from branch to branch at up to half his

or her speed without needing to make Climb checks.

1. Wooden Gate

The  wooden  buildings  surrounding  these  two  tree  trunks  are

built  more  sturdily  than  any  of  the  shelters  in  the  outpost.

They are joined at the top to form an arch, and a flimsy two-

piece  wooden  gate  is  attached  to  the  frame.  Ladders  on  the

north side of the small buildings allow easy access to the tree

line. One sentry is on duty watching this area at all times.

The Drow

2. South Cave Entrance

This shelter guards the entrance to the 5-foot-wide tunnel lead-

ing downward to the Underdark level. The tunnel heads south-

east, then begins several switchbacks before entering area 2 in

the Underdark level. The total length of this tunnel is approx-

imately 500 feet.

4. Eastern Guardpost

Three large stalagmite pillars have been supplemented by a 3-

foot wall of rubble that connects them to the north wall. The

combination of wall and pillars provides three-quarters cover

(+7 AC, +3 Reflex save bonus) for any creatures fighting from

behind it.

3. North Cave Entrance

Similar to area 2, this 5-foot-wide tunnel winds its way down-

ward over about 600 feet of distance to reach area 1 in the Un-

derdark level.

4. Shelter

Each of these simple structures is the sleeping area for up to six

drow. Because about half of the outposts population is on patrol at

any time, usually no more than two or three drow are in each of

these shelters. Because of the cooperative philosophy that Vhaer-

aun-worshipers share, there are no separate quarters for any of the

leaders; a drow of any rank can be found in one of these shelters.

5. Pit Trap

These large areas are 20-foot-deep pits that have been covered

over  with  a  light  framework  of  planks,  rope,  brush,  dirt,  and

carefully cut strips of sod (Search check DC 20 to notice). Any

creature that weighs less than 40 pounds can cross it safely, but

all  others  must  make  Reflex  saving  throws  (DC  20  to  avoid

falling into it). The pit functions as a deterrent and a sort of

alarm, because the breaking wood and falling items can be heard

throughout the entire outpost.

UNDERDARK LEVEL

This large cavern has a ceiling about 40 feet high in the center,

tapering down to between 10 and 15 feet at the edges and in the

tunnels. No lights are used here, since the drow rely on darkvi-

sion. The entire area is patrolled by a very young deep dragon

allied with the drow; the dragon has a small lair in area 7. The

southwest  alcove  has  a  shallow  pool  of  fresh  water  that  has

trickled down from the stream above. The pool contains hun-

dreds of tiny, blind cave fish that feed on waterborne fungus

and aquatic creatures too small to be seen. These fish are some-

times caught and eaten by the deep dragon when it gets bored.

The doors on this level are simple wooden doors and have

no locks. They are all well maintained (not stuck), and each has

a bar that can be used to secure the door from the inside (break

DC 22). The doors to the west, northwest, east, and southeast

are normally kept barred and only opened if the person on the

other side knows the proper password (changed daily).

1. North Entrance

This door leads to a tunnel that eventually emerges on the sur-

face in area 3.

2. South Entrance

This door opens on a tunnel that ends on the surface in area 2.

3. Western Guardpost

Two guards are on duty here at all times, watching over the

western  and  northwestern  entrances.  The  wall  of  rubble  is  3

feet  tall  and  provides  one-half  cover  (+4  AC,  +2  Reflex  save

bonus) for any creature fighting from behind it.

5. Alchemists Lab

This  lab  is  the  territory  of  Valas,  second  cousin  of  Jezz  the

Lame  and  primary  spellcaster  of  this  outpost.  Here  he  pre-

pares the potions and alchemical items used by the drow of this

outpost. He always prepares one invisibility and one passwall

spell each day so he can secretly reach area 9 if he has to. He is

under standing orders to aid in the defense of the Underdark

level of the outpost but to retreat if he believes the defenders

might fall.

The room is divided into two sections: the actual lab to the

west and a small sleeping area for Valas to the east. When he

sleeps or is deep in his work, he keeps the door barred (from the

inside) to keep him from being disturbed or attacked. The lab sec-

tion  of  the  room  contains  all  the  materials  needed  for  an  al-

chemists  lab  (see  Chapter  7  of  the  Players Handbook),  giving

him a +2 circumstance bonus on Alchemy checks. Valas can also

make drugs, and provides doses of kammarth and ziran (see the

appendix) to the leaders of the outpost to distribute among the

rest of the group.

6. Privy

This simple lavatory feeds a small colony of active fungus that

gives  off  a  sweet  odor.  A  few  clusters  of  stranger  fungi  also

grow here and are used by Valas as ingredients in potions and

alchemical concoctions.

7. Dragons Lair

This is the lair of Jhanilmexa, a very young deep dragon discov-

ered as a wyrmling and befriended by the drow of House Jaelre.

She is given fish from the stream above, occasional slaves (who

are eventually eaten), and small treasures to add to her hoard.

Her treasure is located within a small space she dug at the base

of the large pillar. The access tunnel is 8 feet long. It can only

be  traversed  by  a  small  character,  and  only  with  difficulty

(Escape Artist DC 25). She normally moves through the tunnel

in her serpentine form.

Jhanilmexa: Female very young deep dragon; CR 4; Small

The Night Masks

(legless)  form  three  times  per  day  at  very  young  age.  This

form  is  the  same  size  as  the  dragon,  but  is  able  to  move

through  smaller  tunnels  because  it  has  no  legs.  The  dragons

AC worsens by 6 in this form. It moves at 30 feet, flies at 10

feet (poor), and swims at 30 feet. It loses all claw attacks in

this form, but can constrict opponents (+3 melee), dealing 1d8

damage. If the dragon hits with this attack, it can make a free

grapple check (without provoking an attack of opportunity). If

it wins this check, it grabs and constricts its victim, automati-

cally  dealing  the  above  damage  every  round  until  the  oppo-

nent dies or breaks free.

Possessions: Gems:  malachite  (30  gp),  red  spinel  (130  gp),

violet garnet (600 gp).

8. Secret Entrance

A  thick  cluster  of  stalagmites  and  stalactites  has  grown  to-

gether to create a wall across this portion of the tunnel. Despite

this obstacle, footprints in the dust on the floor lead up to this

point and disappear into it. However, no secret door is here. The

chamber beyond (which can be detected by scrying or entered

by  a  creature  in  gaseous  form,  an  incorporeal  creature,  or  a

Diminutive creature) is normally accessed by the drow with the

help of Valas, who uses a passwall spell to open a way through.

The barrier can be broken through with tools or weapons, but

because the barrier is more than 5 feet thick, doing so takes a

great deal of time.

Should Valas feel the outpost is being overrun, he barks an

order in Undercommon for the other drow to fall back and as-

semble near this area, at which point he casts passwall to make

an  opening  to  area  9.  Once  the  way  is  clear,  the  drow  move

into area 9, at which point Valas activates the portal there to

allow them to escape.

If  the  drow  are  prevented  from  entering  area  9  or  the

portal itself,  they  scatter  and  leave  the  cavern  through  the

western or eastern exits, losing their pursuers among the twists

and turns of the tunnels.

9. Portal Room

This oval chamber is cut off from the rest of the cavern by a

nearly  impenetrable  wall  of  stone.  The  far  end  of  the  room

contains a portal to a larger base of House Jaelre. The portal

was created by Valas (using a teleportation circle spell from a

scroll) and only functions once every tenday. It is activated by

the touch of a drow hand (even a dead or amputated one). If a

retreat is called, Valas activates the portal when the drow are

within  a  double  move  of  the  gate  (allowing  them  to  jump

through it before it closes on Valass next turn).

If the heroes pursue the drow through the portal, whether

immediately or after a tenday or more, they reach an Under-

dark drow stronghold of House Jaelre miles away. More than a

hundred  drow,  all  expecting  invaders  to  come  through  their

portal, await the unlucky party. In all likelihood, if the heroes

havent come through in the first few days after the drow re-

treat,  a  force  of  drow  teleports  to  the  outpost  to  scout  this

area, determine the situation, and possibly destroy the portal.

10. Trance Area

Any drow in trance or relaxing are likely to be in this portion

of the cave.

11. Mess Area

Any  off-duty  drow  who  arent  sleeping  are  probably  here,

eating  a  quick  meal,  preparing  their  weapons,  and  talking  to

each other in low voices or in the sign language of drow.

The Night Masks

The Night King reclined, silent but attentive, on his throne. The

feeble  moans  arising  from  the  man  who  stood  very  still  on  the

damp flagstones before him meant as little to him as the bleating

of sheep. The prisoners hands were bound tightly behind his back,

and his body was wrapped in razor-sharp metal wire that bit

deeply into his exposed skin each time he moved. The mans only

hope  of  avoiding  excruciating  injury  was  to  remain  absolutely

still, but the exposed red gashes that peeked from beneath his torn

clothing  gave  testimony  to  his  failure.  Droplets  of  his  blood  al-

ready  stained  the  floor  of  the  Night  Kings  audience  chamber.

The Court of Night, the quartet of vampire dukes who served as

extensions of Orbakhs will, looked on appreciatively at the grim

sport . . . and hungrily at the appetizing crimson stain that grew

slowly, drop by drop, at the foot of their masters throne. Leaning

forward slightly, the Night King began to speak.

Thaleem  of  Teziir,  you  have  betrayed  the  Night  Masks.

Yours was a simple task: You were charged with reporting the

movements  of  one  Vendryth,  head  forger  of  the  Astorians

guild,  to  your  cell  leader.  Yet  you  failed  because  you  allowed

yourself to be purchased with gold offered by the very target you

were sent to observe. The Court of Night stands witness to your

confession. Receive now the punishment you have earned.

Orbakh raised a pale, languid hand and spoke a single word,

invoking the Art of which he was a true master. Instantly the

prisoner began writhing, and it was clear to the onlookers that he

was attempting to dance in place. Unable to control his own move-

ments,  the  man  could  not  prevent  the  wire  from  doing  its  un-

speakable work. His blood spattered against the floor, the walls,

and the vampires, who wiped it from their clothes and skin, then

licked it from their fingers with greedy satisfaction. The mans

anguished screams rose to the vaulted ceiling of the underground

chamber, in a crescendo of agony that died to a faint whisper,

and then silence.

The Night Masks is a powerful thieves guild that operates out

of the metropolis of Westgate on the Dragon Coast. The term

thieves guild is something of a misnomer, because theft is

the least of the Night Masks numerous illegal activities. En-

gaged in such illicit but lucrative trades such as assassination,

extortion,  smuggling,  blackmail,  and  kidnapping,  the  Night

Masks  control  Westgates  underworld.  Operating  mainly  at

night, guild operatives haunt the citys shadowed streets, some-

times  clashing  with  the  City  Watch,  armed  adventurers,  and

private soldiers in the employ of the citys nobles.

These nobles, whose houses comprise the leading merchant

interests in the city, ostensibly rule Westgate through a ruling

council. The head of each familyten in allsits on the coun-

cil and represents his houses views and wishes on all aspects of

the citys administration. It is no secret that these families are

economic competitors, and that they have been engaged in a

semicovert power struggle against one another for as long as

the council has existed.

Virtually  all  of  Westgates  citizenry,  as  well  as  those  in

other lands, believe that the council actively opposes the depre-

dations  of  the  Night  Masks.  This  appearance  is  a  deception,

one of many crafted with care by the leaders of the thieves

guild to obscure its true purpose. The Night Masks leadership

directly controls three of the noble houses and is using them to

further its own goals. It intends to control the remainder, and

much more, in time. In addition, the Night Masks have also

gained  indirect  control  of  some  of  the  citys  institutions,  in-

cluding  the  dock  operations  (which  are  vital  to  the  guilds

smuggling endeavors).

If  the  general  populace  of  Westgate

knew the truth about the citys power struc-

ture,  they  might  find  it  difficult  to  believe

that  an  organization  composed  entirely  of

criminalseven  an  organization  as  well  or-

ganized  and  skilled  as  the  Night  Masks

could bring such a wealthy and powerful city

under its thumb. Under normal conditions,

they would be correct. However, the key to

the  Night  Masks  political  manipulations

does not lie with the groups ordinary mem-

bers, or with its usual criminal activities. For all

their greed and viciousness, the evil committed by the

majority  of  the  guild  members  pales  in  comparison  to  that

contemplated  by  their  unseen  masters.  The  common  thugs,

burglars, thieves, and cutthroats who make up the bulk of the

Night  Masks  membership  believe  themselves  ruled  by  an

anonymous  Guildmaster,  called  the  Faceless.  While  it  is  true

that such an individual does exist, these same guild members

(as well as most of the citizenry) would almost certainly flee

the city if they knew his true nature or understood his goals.

The  true  ruler  of  the  Night  Masks  is  the  Court  of  Night

Masters,  a  coven  of  powerful,  ruthless  vampires  who  harbor

ambitions far darker than the mere clandestine rulership of a

single city. The leader of this groupthe Night King himself,

who  also  holds  the  title  of  Facelessis  a  vampire  who  re-

named himself Orbakh. He is also one of the surviving stasis

clones of the infamous wizard Manshoon of the Zhentarim.

Brief History

The Night Masks have been a part of Westgates history since

1353 DR, when the first Faceless assembled a band of assassins,

thieves, and enforcers to gain control of the citys fractious un-

derworld.  Following  their  masters  directives,  the  guild  mem-

bers  quickly  extinguished  or  absorbed  all  the  criminal

organizations  that  opposed  them.  The  consolidated  organiza-

tion began competing with the merchant houses for control of

the  citys  illegal  activities.  The  merchant  houses  struck  back,

and the resulting conflict became a semisecret street war that

lasted  nearly  two  decades  before  the  Night  Masks  gained  the

upper hand.

The thieves guild suffered a near-fatal setback in 1368 DR

when  Alias  of  Westgate  and  Dragonbait,  a  saurial  paladin,

were engaged to curtail the Night Masks activities. The Harp-

er  duo  and  their  allies  managed  to  eventually  unmask  the

Faceless (the second to hold the title) and significantly disrupt

his groups operations. Unwilling to admit defeat, the Faceless

attempted to proclaim himself King of Westgate, but was slain

shortly  thereafter.  The  guild  might  have  perished  then  for

lack of competent leadership, or torn itself apart with infight-

ing as several of the remaining members scrambled for con-

trol of the groups various operations. But in 1369 DR a new

Faceless arose to quell these internal conflicts and restore the

Night Masks to their previous strength.

It has always been the custom that the general membership

of the guild does not know the true identity of the Faceless,

though some holders of the title have been less secretive than

others. Each new Faceless must prove himself capable of lead-

ership through actions rather than words. The

individual who rose to claim the title when

the guild faced its darkest hour encountered

few obstacles on his path to becoming the new

Faceless.  The  guild  was  in  a  near-total  state

of  disarray  following  the  death  of  its  last

leader, and was hungry for new leadership

particularly when that leadership was demon-

strated in the face of adversity. Some limited

dissent in the ranks provided the aspirant to

the Faceless title the opportunity to show his

mettle. Those who objected to his ascension, or

sought it for themselves, were murdered in spec-

tacularly  gruesome  fashion,  often  inside  what  they  had

supposed  were  their  well-guarded  private  quarters.  One  rival

was reportedly struck down only hours after he announced his

intentions  to  a  group  of  his  comrades  who  were  enjoying  an

evening  in  the  Purple  Lady  festhall.  Dozens  of  witnesses

watched,  horror-struck,  as  he  was  literally  torn  apart  in  the

street outside the establishment by a massive swarm of fren-

zied dire bats. One of his henchmen hastily scooped what little

remained of the unfortunate mans corpse into a helmet and

conveyed it to a nearby guild safehouse to report the incident.

The new Faceless was accepted by all shortly thereafter.

The Faceless chose not to reveal to his new minions that he

was a vampire. He had used the abilities granted by his undead

condition  to  obtain  information  about  dissenters  and  rivals

and  then  kill  them  (being  able  to  take  on  gaseous  form  is  a

very effective means of entering otherwise impenetrable areas,

and  the  ability  to  summon  the  creatures  of  the  night  to  do

ones bidding makes for a novel form of execution). But even if

the guild had somehow learned the truth about the Facelesss

nature, there was no way the members could know that he was

no  ordinary  vampire.  He  was  also  one  of  the  few  surviving

stasis  clones  of  the  infamous  Manshoon,  erstwhile  leader  of

the Zhentarim. He had awakened in the catacombs beneath the

city just as the Manshoon Wars began, only to discover that

prior to his revival he had been abducted and drained by the

vampire Orlak, the self-proclaimed Night King who laired be-

neath Westgate. The clones first act upon rising was to hunt

down and destroy his creator, taking the title for his own and

adopting the name Orbakh. Ensconcing himself in his late pre-

decessors  underground  lair,  Orbakh  contemplated  his  goals

and  plans  for  the  future.  But  as  he  pondered  his  situation,

emerging from the undercity only to hunt and feed, he found

his actions influenced by a surprising manipulator.

Among the treasures he inherited from his slain creator

was the Maguscepter (see the appendix) and a pair of powerful

magic items: the Argraal of Orlak and the Flying Fangs of the

Night King.

39

The Night Masks

The Argraal was an enchanted drinking goblet that filled

with the fresh blood of any victim that had been slain by its

companion piece, the Flying Fangs. This was a magic weapon

that drained life energy from its victims, as well as blood. Both

were imbued with some part of their creators essence, and they

worked  in  tandem  to  influence  whoever  possessed  them.  The

vampire clone found himself feeling an inexplicable but deep-

seated need to be served by beings of a similar nature. By the

time his research discovered the source of this compulsion, he

had already used the Argraal and the Fangs to create several

servitor vampires and dub them his Court of Night Masters.

Not desiring to waste potentially useful resources (and fully

aware that good help is hard to find), Orbakh did not eliminate

his servitor vampires. After a period of observation in the city,

he  decided  his  first  act  would  be  to  claim  leadership  of  the

Night Masks and revitalize the guild. He and his Court would

be  the  secret  rulers  of  the  organization,  reshaping  it  to  suit

their own ends.

the Organization

Headquarters: The Night Masks do not maintain a guildhall

or other central meeting location (that would make the job of

the City Watch far too easy). The organization instead main-

tains  dozens  of  safe  houses  throughout  Westgate,  many  of

which  are  legitimate  businesses  during  the  day.  The  closest

thing the guild has to a town hall is the Purple Lady festhall,

owned and operated by one of the Night Masks upper echelon.

Members are free to meet and leave messages for one another

here, provided that they do nothing to alert the patrons to the

hosts role in the organization (and that includes not wearing

dirty street clothing inside the establishment).

Members: Approximately  900,  including  the  Court  of

Night Masters.

Hierarchy: Webbed.

Leader: The Faceless.

Religion: Mask.

Alignment: CE, LE, NE.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: Domino mask (a black cloth mask shaped to cover

the eyes and nose, cut with two eyeholes), used both as a sigil

and  as  a  physical  token  of  the  guilds  work.  Anyone  who  be-

trays the Night Masks and does not immediately flee beyond

their reach is eventually discovered dead, with a domino mask

shoved in his mouth, wrapped around his slit throat, used as a

ligature to bind his hands, or otherwise adorning his corpse.

In former days, the Night Masks habitually identified busi-

nesses that paid protection money to the guild by inscribing the

mask symbol somewhere on the businesss property, as a notice

and a warning to other would-be extortionists. The Night King

ordered this practice abandoned shortly after the Court of Night

Masters reached its full complement. He did not want to make

it so simple for enemies to identify the Night Masks business

associates by providing a visible marker for them to follow.

The Night Masks hierarchy is complex, structured to provide

maximum protection for those who lead it. Some details about

the Night Masks are given in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Cam-

paign  Setting.  The  following  information  is  for  the  Night

Masks who operate only in Westgate.

HIERARCHY

From the groups inception, an anonymous guildmaster and

his inner council of lieutenants have ruled the Night Masks.

The Faceless traditionally wields supreme authority over the

entire  guild,  but  delegates  responsibility  for  the  organiza-

tions  various  activities  and  interests  to  the  Night  Masters,

who  in  turn  employ  a  retinue  of  assistants,  agents,  and

flunkies to carry out their will. The majority of the rank-and-

file  membership  consists  of  rogues  and  assassins.  The  guild

also counts among its members a number of clerics, fighters,

sorcerers,  wizards,  and  a  smattering  of  other  professions  as

well.  Not  everyone  on  the  Night  Masks  payroll  is  a  full-

fledged member. Many, particularly those who collect infor-

mation  for  the  guild  in  distant  cities,  are  freelance

operatives.

The Faceless

The Faceless has the prerogative to structure the guild as he

pleases. Each successive Faceless has reorganized the guilds

hierarchy to suit himself, though all the holders of the title

have retained the core administrative elements of the Face-

less and the Night Masters regardless of what other changes

he wrought. Orbakh has, in his turn, redefined the organiza-

tional structure to both reflect his personal leadership style

and  better  achieve  his  goals.  The  current  hierarchy  begins

with  the  Night  King  himself  at  the  apex  of  the  structure.

Four  senior  members  of  the  Court  of  Night  Masters,  the

dukes,  report  directly  to  him.  Next  are  the  counts,  each  of

whom reports to one of the dukes. Each count has a number

of lieutenants, who deal directly with the rank and file of the

organization. The general membership is differentiated into

cell-like  units  that  deal  only  with  those  members  immedi-

ately above and below them in the hierarchy. This structure

makes  it  very  difficult  for  a  given  member  of  the  thieves

guild to identify any of his fellow members who are not in

his  cell,  diminishing  the  risk  of  exposure  throughout  the

entire  organization.  The  number  of  street-level  members

once  numbered  almost  two  thousand,  but  Orbakh  trimmed

that  number  down  within  a  year  of  becoming  the  Faceless,

eliminating almost eight hundred persons that he considered

to be nonessential (including a purge of those discovered to

be disloyal).

The  current  Faceless  prefers  to  exercise  indirect  control

over  the  elements  of  Westgate  that  are  currently  under  his

thumb, and he expects his minions to do the same. While it is

possible for a vampire to simply use his domination ability to

get  a  mortal  to  do  his  bidding,  as  the  Night  King  has  done

with Lady Thistle Thalavar, he considers this technique both

inelegant  and  risky  if  used  too  frequently.  It  takes  a  strong

will to dominate a mortal so thoroughly that he or she nei-

ther disobeys commands nor shakes off the vampires control.

To minimize the risk of failure and exposure, the Night King

prefers  that  his  servitor  vampires  (and  their  progeny)  work

through intermediaries whenever possible. It isnt necessary to

dominate  the  harbormaster,  for  example,  when  by  working

through  agents  a  vampire  can  bribe,  threaten,  or  blackmail

him just as effectively without revealing anything of his true

nature  or  motivations.  The  Count  of  Storms  need  not  meet

personally with the harbormaster in order to make sure that

eyes look the other way when a certain ship unloads a certain

smuggled  cargo  on  a  certain  night.  Instead,  he  can  work

through  intermediaries  to  make  sure  that  the  harbormaster

receives  a  little  something  in  return  for  having  his  men

absent from a particular dock

at a particular time on a par-

ticular  day.  Likewise,  the

Count of Coins need not meet

personally with a client at the

Purple Lady festhall in order

to  blackmail  him  regarding

his egregious gambling habits.

He  can  have  any  one  of  a

dozen  intermediaries  do  so,

giving himself plausible denia-

bility.

The Night Masters, on the

other  hand,  do  sometimes

meet  personally  with  and

dominate  the  heads  of  the

noble  houses  they  control.

They normally resort to such

direct  and  heavy-handed  tac-

tics only when something crit-

ical  to  their  plans  is  at  stake.

Otherwise,  they  prefer  to  use

the same indirect methods on

their puppet councilors, work-

ing  through  intermediaries

and  agents  to  achieve  the  de-

sired  result.  They  are  natu-

rally  careful  not  to  have  the

council members do anything

so  outrageous  that  suspicion

falls  on  them.  Instead,  they

utilize  their  pet  councilors  to

make  small  but  strategically

important  moves  in  the  city

that have long-term benefit to

the  Night  Masks,  such  as  re-

fusing  to  vote  in  favor  of  a

budget  increase  for  the  City

Watch,  voting  to  appoint  a

certain  person  to  a  sensitive

city  office,  or  making  sure

that a particular nephew is ap-

pointed  to  a  cushy  job  as  a

scribe  in  the  hall  where  the

citys  property  records  are

kept.  In  this  fashion,  and

through  such  incremental  ac-

complishments, do the Night Masks gain more control over

their city.

The Faceless, also known as Orbakh and The Night King

(NE male vampire Wiz16/Acm1): The notorious Manshoon

is responsible for a great many crimes and atrocities, but per-

haps none may prove so dangerous for Faern as the creation

of  his  stasis  clones.  The  prototypical  Manshoon  personality

remains largely intact in this clone, but it has been made even

darker as a result of the clones unholy transformation into a

vampire.  Like  his  progenitor,  Orbakh  has  made  power  the

focus of his existence. Where the power comes from is largely

a  matter  of  circumstance,  and  in  the  Night  Kings  case  it

comes  from  his  rulership  of

the thieves guild. But he must

always  have  more,  and  to  this

end he intends to create a great

kingdom  of  vampires  and  fill

it  with  hapless  mortal  slaves.

He  must  always  be  the  domi-

nant individual in his environ-

ment,  and  he  strives  to  secure

his  place  at  the  apex  of  any

power structure he employs.

Hence,  Orbakh  believes  that

all  other  beings  are  necessarily

divided  into  two  categories:

those that are demonstrably in-

ferior, and those that have been

elevated beyond their worth. He

cannot  hide  his  contempt  for

others.  In  all  his  dealings  and

interactions,  his  natural  conde-

scension is plainly visible, even

though he glosses it over with a

veneer of charm. He cannot tol-

erate rivals. He goes out of his

way to crush them as quickly as

possible,  hoping  that  by  doing

so he is providing an example to

any  others  who  avow  them-

selves  his  enemies.  Only  three

years  a  vampire,  Orbakh  has

not  yet  acquired  the  long-term

perspective  and  patience  that

comes to most powerful undead

creatures  as  the  centuries  pass

them by. He is still prone to fits

of  impatience,  emotionalism,

and self-indulgent cruelty.

In  his  supreme  confidence,

he cannot imagine that his plan

to  build  a  kingdom  in  which

vampires  are  the  dominant

force  might  not  succeed.  His

mind  cannot  admit  even  the

slightest possibility of failure.

Tall  and  well  muscled,

Orbakh cuts an imposing figure

in  his  custom  black  armor

chased with gold enamel. His state of undeath has given its cus-

tomary  pallor  to  his  face,  but  few  other  than  the  Court  of

Night see his features because he habitually wears a helm to

conceal his face.

The Dukes

Darklady  Dahlia  Vhammos, the  Duchess  of  Venom  (CE

female vampire Clr15/Div2 of Shar): This calculating and ambi-

tious aristocrat was the first to fall victim to Orbakhs desire for

vampire servants. In the months prior to becoming the Faceless,

he heard rumors of a secret temple dedicated to the Dark Deity

located somewhere under the city and sought it out, locating it fi-

nally  deep  beneath  Castle  Vhammos.  Orbakh  observed  the

temples high priestess, Darklady Dahlia Vhammos, for several

weeks, admiring her ambition, intellect, and capacity for cruelty.

Because of these qualities plus her noble blood (Dahlias mortal

family is one of the ruling merchant noble houses of Westgate),

Orbakh  brought  her  forcibly  into  the  world  of  the  undead,

making her the first member of his Court of Night Masters. The

Night King bestowed on her the title of Duchess of Venom and

charged her with control of the guilds assassins. Dahlia proved

uniquely suited to the task, demonstrating that she has a skilled

eye when evaluating the worth of a potential killer. She occasion-

ally leads assassination missions that take place in the city.

Although she is Orbakhs servitor vampire and cannot act

against  him,  she  does  retain  some  personal  ambitions  of  her

own.  Dahlia  regrets  nothing  about  her  involvement  with

Orbakh or her new undead state. She believes this is all by the

design of Shar, and sees her induction into the Night Masks as

nothing  less  than  a  golden  opportunity  to  gain  new  converts

for her pitiless deity. To this end she encourages her lieutenants

and  those  they  choose  to  attend  worship  ceremonies  at  her

secret temple. When she is not conducting guild business, that is

where she is normally found, since she is Shars highest-ranking

cleric  in  the  city.  Dahlia  has  faith  that  she  can  convert  the

Court of Night Masters to the worship of Shar in time.

Moreover,  she  views  Orbakhs  plan  to  create  a  vampire

kingdom as a goal that could also be turned to the uses of the

Lady of Loss, and she supports it completelyin fact, she in-

tends  to  rule  the  kingdom  by  Orbakhs  side,  as  his  queen.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the only matter on which

she and Orbakh have ever seriously disagreed is his intent to

wed the Lady Thistle Thalavar as part of his scheme to crown

himself  the  monarch  of  Westgate.  Dahlia  is  jealous  of

Orbakhs attentions to his puppet, and if she could find a way

to free herself from the compulsion to do as her master com-

mands, she would destroy the simpering little mortal in an in-

stant. As it is, she must content herself with undermining the

girls  activities  on  the  sly,  trying  to  make  her  lose  favor  in

Orbakhs eyes, and hoping he doesnt catch on.

The Lady Dahlia is of average height with a slender build. In

life she was pretty, but death has both heightened and twisted

her beauty, giving her the appearance of a pale, regal predator.

Her jet-black hair falls straight and full to her shoulders, fram-

ing her violet, red-rimmed eyes and high cheekbones. When not

dressed in the regalia of her priesthood, she favors the expen-

sive and extravagant courtly garb of her breathing days.

Phultan  Hammerwand,  the  Duke  of  Whispers (LE  male

vampire Wiz16): For years this smooth-tongued, urbane crimi-

nal mastermind traveled the Heartlands in the guise of a mer-

chant trader. He used a luxuries caravan as a cover for his real

business, which was the acquisition and selling of sensitive in-

formation (as well as a fair bit of forgery, smuggling, and fenc-

ing stolen goods on the side when the mood or need struck him).

During his mercantile journeys he forged a number of useful

connections with various criminal groups and organizations in

the cities where his caravan called. His more notable associates

include the Shadow Thieves of Amn, the Astorians of Teziir,

the Thieves Guild of Waterdeep, and the Xanathar. In addition

he  established  a  network  of  paid  informants  stretching  from

Selgaunt to Baldurs Gate, which supplied him with all manner

of useful information that he then sold again, sometimes to the

highest bidder and sometimes to the individual who could best

recognize its value.

During one of Phultans many excursions to Westgate, he

came into possession of information damaging to one of the

lieutenants of the Night Masks. He was marked for death as a

result,  and  he  would  have  perished  at  the  hands  of  Lady

Dahlias assassins had he not first demonstrated his skills by di-

vining the correct means of contacting the Faceless himself.

Impressed, the Night King realized that Phultan was worth far

more  to  him  alive,  or  rather,  undead.  The  gossipmonger

became the second inductee into the Court of Night Masters as

Orbakhs personal spymaster and information broker.

Phultan is unable to travel as he once did. It is not quite so

easy for a vampire to journey through Faern posing as a cara-

van master as it is for a mortal. Instead he remains in West-

gate, the spider at the center of a vast and powerful web of spies

and informants. Through his chosen agents and emissaries he

maintains his old contacts, both with his criminal associates and

hired eyes, giving the Night Masks a plethora of information

about the cities and lands beyond their home. Phultan is proba-

bly the best-informed individual in Westgate, and perhaps in all

the Dragon Coast as well.

Phultan is not what most people think of when they picture a

vampire lord. The liquid diet required by vampirism has worked

unattractive changes on his formerly rotund body. Deprived of its

steady diet of rich foods, his once corpulent flesh now sags, hang-

ing  in  grotesque,  flabby  folds  from  his  face  and  frame,  giving

him a hideous appearance. His reddish-brown hair was already re-

ceding when he became a vampire, and now it hangs in moist,

straggly patches over his ears and around the back of his scalp.

Tebryn Shadowstalker Dhialael, the Duke of Shadows (CE

male vampire Wiz3/Rog8/Gld5): A renegade half-elf of drow

ancestry, Tebryn fled a life of brutal treatment as an inden-

tured servant in the drow city of Sschindylrynyr for the per-

ilous  freedom  of  the  surface  world.  He  escaped  when  the

duergar  armies  of  Underspires  overran  the  mining  encamp-

ment in which he was condemned to labor until he died, taking

advantage of the attacks chaos to murder his overseer and flee

the area. He emerged from the Underdark into the catacombs

of Westgate, making his home here until by chance he located

the secret haven of Orbakh and Dahlia. Entering the lair, he

made off with several powerful magic items without alerting

the  vampires.  They  discovered  the  theft  soon  thereafter  and

tracked Tebryn down to his undercity bolthole. Tebryn was the

third and final victim of Orbakhs desire for servitors, and the

last  victim  to  fall  beneath  the  Night  Kings  Flying  Fangs

before that magic weapon was destroyed. Orbakh and Dahlia

were in total agreement as to how their newest recruit would

serve. He was dubbed the Duke of Shadows and placed in con-

trol of the Night Masks thieving operations.

Tebryn took to his new existence with enthusiasm and grat-

itude.  He  had  gained  power,  authority,  wealth,  and  allies  far

greater than any he could have hoped to attain in his former

life. As the Duke of Shadows, he combines the advantages of

his vampirism with his mastery of rogue skills to move about

Westgate unseen by any except those to whom he chooses to

The Night Masks

reveal himself. He orchestrates all the guilds thieving activi-

ties through his lieutenants, directing them against local mer-

chants,  visiting  caravans,  and  of  course,  the  noble  houses.

Many of the lower-ranking thugs, bravos, cutpurses, burglars,

and footpads who make up the bulk of the Night Masks mem-

bership rolls believe Tebryn to be the Faceless.

Tebryns skin is not as dark as that of a full-blooded drow

but dark enough to clearly define his ancestry. His hair is the

stark white of his drow parent, and his frame is that slender

but  wiry  musculature  common  to  elves  and  half-elves  alike.

His eyes are obviously inherited from his human parent, for

they are a bright blue-white, startling in so dark a face.

The Twilight Knight: The self-styled Twilight Knight han-

dles the guilds enforcement, including protection rackets and

strong-arm  extortion.  The  Duke  of  Twilight  keeps  his  face

hidden behind a skull mask, and only the Night King knows the

knights  true  identity.  Phultan  Hammerwand  obtained  infor-

mation that leads him to believe that the Twilight Night was

once  a  paladin  of  Lathander  who  fell  from  grace  during  the

Time of Troubles after being lured away from his faith by the

temptation  of  power.  Not  desiring  to  earn  the  Twilight

Knights enmity (at least, not until doing so becomes conven-

ient), Hammerwand has kept his suspicions to himself. Regard-

less of his past, there seems to be no question that the Duke of

Twilight is remarkably skilled at his many tasks. In addition to

administering the thieves guilds operations that require physi-

cal coercion and violence, he also oversees both internal and ex-

ternal  security  for  the  thieves  guild.  Traitors,  snitches,  and

those rogues who attempt to cheat the guild out of its due are

almost certain to spend their final moments of life in the com-

pany of some of the Twilight Nights minions.

The Counts

Orbakh  is  still  in  the  process  of  assembling  his  full  comple-

ment of Night Masters. Each duke is served by two or more

counts. Described here are two notable members of this tier in

the hierarchy.

Sorenth Happy Gorender, the Count of Coins (NE male

vampire Rog8/Gld5): The gregarious and charming owner and

bartender of the Purple Lady festhall was already a master of

the  blackmail  game  before  he  was  inducted  into  the  Night

Masks  to  oversee  this  aspect  of  the  guilds  operations.  Care-

fully chosen by Orbakh to serve as his chief criminal link to

the city above, Happy has easy access to his festhalls upscale

clientele of jaded nobles and thrill-seeking merchants who wish

to hobnob above their station. The Purple Ladies supply their

employer  with  a  steady  diet  of  useful  information  obtained

from their unsuspecting, intoxicated, and ardent clients, who

are rewarded for sharing confidences by becoming the targets

of  Happys  blackmail  schemes.  Equally  important,  Happys

role  permits  him  to  remain  indoors  during  daylight  hours

without arousing suspicion. He uses the festhall as a means to

communicate  secretly  with  many  of  the  folk  in  his  employ,

who  pass  through  the  establishment  in  a  variety  of  disguises

(deliveryfolk, merchants, patrons, craftsfolk, and so on). Most

of  Happys  victims  realize  that  they  have  little  choice  other

than to pay up, but sometimes he encounters an individual who

requires some persuasion to see the situation properly. Happy

never does any of the dirty work himself, however, instead re-

porting the targets name to the Duke of Twilight for some ju-

dicious  roughing-up.  Another  benefit  he  gains  from  his  role

and  location  is  the  ease  with  which  it  permits  him  to  feed.

Happy helps himself to one of the lovely Purple Ladies when-

ever he feels peckish.

With  his  ready  smile  and  charming  manners,  Happy  ap-

pears to be the very soul of affable gentility. He is unfailingly

courteous, even when vexed, a habit that when combined with

his  handsome  face  encourages  his  clientele  to  trust  him.

Happys pride is his full mane of long, blond hair that falls in

gentle  curls  to  his  shoulders;  he  usually  ties  his  locks  into  a

pony tail with a bit of ribbon, chosen to match whatever garb

hes wearing for the evening.

Draegan  Guldar,  the  Count  of  Storms (CE  male  vampire

Rog9/Gld3): The nephew of Dathguld Guldar, the head of one

of  the  merchant  noble  houses  of  Westgate,  Sir  Draegan  is

known all over the city as a notorious young rakehell. A third

son, Draegan had no interest in the family business, preferring

instead to spend his monthly allowance on luxuries and plea-

sures. Nothing has changed since the family came to Westgate.

The neer-do-well wastes his days sleeping off the endless series

of parties, galas, and debaucheries that mark his nights. Banned

from several of the citys festhalls for behavior that shocked

even  the  most  jaded  of  the  citys  pleasure-seekers,  the  young

man often hosts his own parties at his familys palatial home.

Having  despaired  of  the  lad  ever  taking  an  interest  in  the

familys  mercantile  ventures,  Draegans  father  now  merely

strives to keep his son out of the city dungeons.

The Night Masks

What neither his family nor the city suspects is that young

Draegan  is  leading  a  double  and  dangerous  lifeor  rather,

unlife.  Thanks  to  Dahlias  discovery  in  Gulthmere,  the  vam-

pire  has  fooled  his  family  and  friends  successfully  for  the

better part of a year, ever since the Duchess of Venom made

him  into  her  servitor.  Draegan  made  the  mistake  of  flirting

outrageously  with  his  fellow  aristocrat  when  they  met  at  a

nobles ball; amused, Dahlia allowed the young man to believe

she was ensnared by his charms. By the end of the evening, he

was ensnared by hers, and by her bite as well. Dahlia persuaded

the Night King to allow Draegan to be their first experiment

with the nights mantle spell, and to date, the results have been

worth the risk. Although he can allow himself to be seen stand-

ing in direct sunlight for only a short time, that has proven

sufficient.  A  natural  actor,  Draegan  has  so  far  managed  to

convince everyone that he is still nothing more than an un-

grateful,  jaded,  extravagant  young  wastrel  ever  in  search  of

greater thrills. Though he still dislikes and avoids the sunlight,

his  ability  to  endure  short  exposures  to  it  prevents  anyone

from suspecting his true nature. Through Draegan, the Night

Masks influence the Guldar family, though Draegan must do

so with subtlety and caution so as not to expose his ruse.

As  the  Count  of  Storms,  Draegan  utilizes  his  cover  as  a

scoundrel  to  meet  more  or  less  openly  with  the  men  and

women  to  whom  he  entrusts  the  guilds  smuggling  assign-

ments. The sight of Draegan boozing it up through the night

with  some  unscrupulous-looking  brutes  in  an  unfashionable

waterfront tavern is not an uncommon sight. What onlookers

dont realize, however, is that this is how the vampire conducts

business with his minions, and very successfully at that.

Draegan  is  handsome,  with  features  that  a  cleric  of  Sune

would envy. His strong jaw, piercing blue eyes, and long brown

hair break hearts in all the festhalls and ballrooms of the city.

Lieutenants

These are the individuals who actually make things happen in

the  organization.  They  receive  instructions  directly  from  the

Court of Night Masters, organize the activities of the cells, and

administer the night-to-night operations of the guild in accor-

dance  with  their  orders.  The  average  lieutenant  of  the  Night

Masks has been with the organization for some time, typically

a decade and often more, and they dont plan to ever leave.

Typical Lieutenant: NE dwarf, half-elf, halfling, or human

Rog6/Gld4.

Raw Recruits and Proven Professionals

A new recruit learns the tradecraft of thieves under the tute-

lage of more experienced cell members. The initiation period

of a recruit lasts until his cell leader decides that hes ready for

advancement,  at  which  point  the  recruit  becomes  a  proven

professional, a period that can last anywhere from six months

to a lifetime. Some street recruits never make it off the streets,

for a variety of reasons. Some display a lack of initiative, while

others are deemed too unreliable to undertake more difficult

assignments. A few choose to remain at the street level for the

entire length of their association with the guild, preferring to

carry out orders rather than give them. A few deserving street

operatives remain stuck at the lower levels due to the invisible

machinations from somewhere higher up on the ladder.

Typical  street-level  operatives  are  assigned  criminal  acts

that,  while  petty  in  the  organizations  larger  schemes,  still

generate valuable income. The degree of the assignments dif-

ficulty depends on the level of experience the recruit demon-

strates and the degree of trust her cell leader has in her abili-

ties.  Standard  assignments  include  pickpocketing  merchants

and travelers in the markets, mugging and rolling drunks ex-

iting the citys many taverns and festhalls, running crooked

gambling games, pulling off simple burglaries, and carrying

messages for superiors. Operatives are paid a weekly stipend

and  are  allowed  to  keep  a  third  of  any  wealth  they  acquire

during operations. The remaining two-thirds goes to the guild

via the street operatives cell leader (who takes a cut of 10%).

More than one street operative has been tempted to retain a

share of the loot that is larger than his due. The results of

such indiscretions are, predictably, almost always fatal.

The  Night  Masks  do  not  discriminate  along  racial  lines

when it comes to recruiting into their lowest echelon. Males

and  females  of  most  humanoid  races  permitted  in  Westgate

can be found in this stratum of the organization.

Typical Street Level Operative (raw recruit): CE dwarf, elf,

gnome, human, half-elf, half-orc, or halfling Rog1.

Typical  Street  Level  Operative  (proven  professional):  CE

dwarf,  elf,  gnome,  human,  half-elf,  half-orc,  or  halfling

Rog5/Gld1.

Toughs

Toughs  are  the  Night  Masks  street-level  legbreakers,  body-

guards, and soldiers. Their job is, simply put, to cause personal

injury and property damage at the direction of their superiors.

Most cell leaders dont go anywhere without a couple of toughs

in tow. Some toughs are culled from the ranks of the standard

street-level operatives (those who show a flair for violence or

who  demonstrate  that  they  can  stand  up  to  a  lot  of  punish-

ment are prime candidates), while others take on the role as

their first assignment with the organization.

The guild doesnt organize toughs into cells of their own, but

instead assigns several toughs to each cell. A lot of toughs grad-

uate from street-level work in a year or two, becoming personal

bodyguards  to  cell  leaders  and  lieutenants.  Members  of  the

Court of Night Masters who recognize some special aptitude or

skill  have  plucked  a  few  from  the  streets.  Toughs  receive  a

weekly stipend, like street operatives, as well as a share of any

profits earned from operations in which they take part. The pay

they receive per job is at the discretion of the cell leader.

Most toughs are dwarves, humans, and half-orcs. The occa-

sional  half-elf  is  found  among  their  ranks,  but  a  gnome  or

halfling tough is almost unheard of in the Night Masks.

Typical Tough: CE dwarf, human, or half-orc Rog1/Ftr1.

Specialists

Naturally, the guild has need of members who possesses a vari-

ety  of  talents.  Members  who  fall  into  this  category  include

forgers,  surveillance  and  countersurveillance  experts,  extor-

tionists, blackmailers, information gatherers, and those whose

professions  are  outside  those  generally  found  in  a  thieves

guild:  low-level  fighters,  sorcerers,  wizards,  and  the  like.

Tradesfolk and craftsfolk are not normally inducted into the

Night Masks even as specialists. The guild has no need, for ex-

ample, to recruit blacksmiths because it retains such craftsmen

on its payroll to construct weapons and special equipment.

44

The Night Masks

Some specialists are identified and recruited from the guilds

street  operatives  and  toughs,  but  most  are  brought  into  the

guild directly at this level for the specific purpose of practicing

their particular trade. Most of these individuals are attached to

a cell that specializes in their particular line of work. Some of

them  even  lead  cells,  though  this  honor  is  not  granted  them

until  they  either  have  put  in  several  years  of  reliable  service

with the guild or have demonstrated unusual competence and

skill. Some specialists take on apprentices, often at the request

of the guild, in order to ensure that the Night Masks are not de-

prived of their talents should anything untoward befall them.

Specialists are paid well for their services and enjoy a share

in the profits earned from the operations in which they are in-

volved. For example, an operation to smuggle goods into the

city  and  then  sell  them,  without  paying  any  of  the  various

import  duties  and  other  taxes  imposed  on  such  trade,  might

net the Night Masks 10,000 gp. The forger who created a set

of  fake  permits  enabling  the  contraband  to  enter  the  city

might earn as much as 10 percent of the take, or 1,000 gp.

Specialists come from all races.

Typical Forgery Specialist: NE gnome, halfling, or human

Exp5.

Typical Surveillance Specialist: LE elf, half-elf, halfling, or

human Rog5/Gld1.

Typical  Wizard  Specialist:  CE  elf,  half-elf,  or  human

Wiz3/Rog1.

Informants

The typical informant is just an ordinary private citizen who

earns a few extra coins by snitching to the Night Masks, and

often to other organizations and institutions as well. The or-

ganization does employ a few full-time informants, however,

who earn their pay by keeping tabs on a particular person or

institution. The Night Masks have several permanent inform-

ants working in the citys docks, the city watch, Fortuneboon

Hall (Tymoras temple in the city), and most of the caravan

yards. Informants are typically paid piecemeal for each nugget

of  information  they  uncover,  and  their  payment  is  usually

scaled according to the value of the news. Professional inform-

ants who fail to turn up useful information, who provide con-

sistently  inaccurate  information,  or  who  betray  the  Night

Masks by trying to play more than one side of the information

game with the guilds enemies are not long for this world.

Typical Informant: NE human Com2.

Appearance and Personality

Street  Operatives,  Raw  Recruits: These  lower-echelon

thieves and toughs are very likely to be overconfident, brash,

and  cocksure.  They  have  only  recently  joined  the  thieves

guild and have an inflated sense of their own importance in

the grand scheme of things. As a result, many of them allow

themselves to be provoked by anything even marginally re-

sembling an insult or threat, using it as an excuse to attack

the offending individual and thereby make a name or oth-

erwise  attract  the  attention  of  their  superiors.  A  good

number  of  them  cant  resist  boasting  about  their  new

friends, and some can even be persuaded to divulge the en-

tirety of their limited knowledge about the Night Masks or-

ganization in exchange for a few tankards of good ale. (Most

of the unintelligent raw recruits dont last long.)

Street Operatives, Proven Professionals: These guild mem-

bers tend to be cautious around people they dont know. They

didnt make it this far in the guild by flapping their gums for

everyone who waves a gold piece. A proven professional who

cannot avoid an encounter with nosy adventurers or intruders

attempts either to escape quickly (without leaving any clues as

to her identity or the nature of her work), or to kill her foes.

An unplanned encounter with these folks is likely to be explo-

sively violent, quiet, and deadly. These people know their busi-

ness  and  try  to  incapacitate  or  kill  intruders  without  any

unnecessary preamble.

Assassins:  No  assassin  worthy  of  the  name  behaves  in  a

fashion that is anything short of consummate professional-

ism. This is true whether the assassin is on a job, enjoying a

drink at her favorite tavern, or attending a public execution.

The true professional never divulges the real nature of her

work, never shares the details of her mission with anyone not

meant  to  be  in  the  know,  and  never  leaves  witnesses  alive

who can identify her.

Cell Leaders, Lieutenants: Adventurers typically dont en-

counter cell leaders or lieutenants unless they have success-

fully infiltrated the organization (in which case an encounter

with a member of the Court of Night Masters is soon forth-

coming) or have stumbled upon an operation in progress. If

the former, they find the cell leaders to be cagey folk, suspi-

cious  in  the  extreme  about  anyone  who  is  not  at  least  a

proven professional. They tend to ask a lot of questions while

attempting  to  give  away  as  little  as  possible.  If  the  latter,

they find in the cell leader a merciless opponent who strives

for nothing other than the death of the interlopers. Cell lead-

ers  generally  dont  play  well  with  others.  They  are  accus-

tomed  to  working  in  isolation,  and  resent  the  intrusion  of

anyone not above them in the chain of command.

Dressing the Part: The smart member of the Night Masks

dresses in such a way that she calls as little attention to her-

self as possible. It isnt beneficial to her or the organization if

the  city  watch  can  tell  just  by  looking  at  her  that  shes  a

member of the thieves guild. At the same time, a field oper-

ative must dress appropriately for the job at hand. If a thief

is planning to climb the walls of a caravan merchants office

and break into its treasure vaults, she must have the neces-

sary gear (ropes, grappling hook, and thieves tools to name a

few). Therefore, each operative is responsible for striking a

balance between anonymity and professional necessity.

Assassins

The Duchess of Venom currently has almost eighty profes-

sional murderers working to fulfill the organizations sched-

uled killings, and shes always on the lookout for more. Some

of  these  undertakings  are  by  contract,  earning  the  Night

Masks  a  profit.  Others  are  motivated  by  the  Night  Kings

long-range plans to destabilize the Dragon Coast and its envi-

rons. Darklady Dahlia recruits, evaluates, and trains her as-

sassins personally, preferring to make certain that she sends

only the best into the field. Those who fail her or who do not

meet her rigorous criteria usually perish under her fangs or

become  targets  for  her  infamous  living  prey  practice  ses-

sions.  Dahlia  requires  that  all  her  killers  maintain  at  least

one  residence  within  Westgate,  so  that  she  can  reach  them

when necessary.

Assassins  are  paid  handsomely  for  their  work,  and  they

are able to live lifestyles of ease and luxury when they are

not  actively  pursuing  their  trade,  if  they  so  choose.  Most

are  intensely  private  individuals,  however,  and  take  great

pains to safeguard both themselves and the secret of their

profession.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  majority  of  the  Night  Masks  members  want  the  same

thing they have always wanted: easy money. Motivated prima-

rily by unabated greed and a desire to avoid anything resem-

bling  honest  labor,  nearly  all  these  criminals  are  in  this

dangerous business for the cash. The lives of these individuals

are often violent and brief. Many newcomers to the guild do

not  survive  more  than  a  few  months  in  this  bloody  trade,

falling to a watchmans spear or the magic trap set by a nobles

pet  wizard.  The  dreams  of  these  footpads  and  smugglers  are

almost  always  focused  on  the  acquisition  of  enough  cash  to

keep them well supplied with liquor and gratuitous entertain-

ment for the rest of their lives. None of the members at this

level  are  aware  of  the  existence  of  the  Night  Masters.  They

report  to  their  cell  leader,  and  they  know  that  somewhere

above him (beyond all the other cell leaders and lieutenants) is

the  overall  leader.  Those  who  have  met  Tebryn  Dhialael  be-

lieve him to be the guildmaster.

The Middle Echelon

The  mid-level  guild  membersthe  cell  leaders,  night-to-night

operations  chiefs,  intermediate  administrators,  and  lieu-

tenantsusually aspire to something a bit less seedy than a life-

time supply of cheap liquor and even cheaper festhall pleasures.

These individuals usually possess some measure of authority, and

most of them have obtained it by climbing their way up from

the ranks below them (often stepping on a good many hands and

skulls  in  the  process).  These  are  career  criminals  who  have

served the guild loyally and well for some time, and are likely to

remain  somewhere  within  the  Night  Masks  power  structure

until they die.

No small number of them have attained a distinctly luxu-

rious  lifestyle,  far  more  comfortable  than  anything  they

could have afforded through honest work, and they desire to

maintain  it.  Others  enjoy  the  power  they  wield,  and  desire

more for its own sake. They also like the prestige that comes

with wielding a position of authority in the guild. A few have

scores to settle with society or individuals, and they see work-

ing for the Night Masks as a means of avenging themselves

on whoever or whatever they believe did them wrong. A tiny

handful use their positions within the guild as a cover for a

personal agenda at odds with the interests of the Night Masks.

Aware  that  discovery  means  an  agonizing  death,  these  few

memberstraitors,  in  the  eyes  of  their  fellowsstrive  to

conceal their true purposes with a disguise of zealous loyalty

and obedience. Most of the members at this level are aware of

the existence of the Night Masters as a group. Only the most

trusted lieutenants have ever met any of the individual Night

Masters, however. One or more of these privileged henchmen

might  suspect  that  the  Night  Masters  are  something  other

than mortal, but so far none of them have shared their suspi-

cions with anyone.

The Upper Echelon

The  Court  of  Night  Masters  is  motivated  by  goals  far

more  grandioseand  frighteningthan  anything  their

agents  and  employees  could  possibly  imagine.  The  court

has  already  achieved  its  first  short-term  goal  by  gaining

the  means  to  influence  Westgates  ruling  council,  and

while it does not yet fully and directly control the entire

city,  this  second  goal  shall  surely  come  to  pass.  Control-

ling the city, even through indirect means, gains the vam-

pires  invaluable  resources,  including  wealth,  political

influence, military power, and a constant supply of fresh

blood.  Only  the  members  of  the  court  are  aware  of  the

role  this  goal  plays  in  their  masters  greater  goal.  Only

they understand what he is ultimately trying to createa

kingdom of vampires.

The Night Kingdom

Though  he  has  become  a  vampire,  the  Manshoon  clone  has

lost little of the thirst for power, to say nothing of the arro-

gance,  ambition,  and  daring  possessed  by  the  original  Man-

shoon himself. The transformation into an undead nocturnal

marauder has subtly altered whatever remained of the original

Manshoons  ambitions  that  were  extant  when  the  clone  re-

vived from stasis. Instead of desiring to re-create or regain con-

trol over the Black Network, the Night King envisions a vast

kingdom ruled by a vampire monarch (himself, naturally) and

governed  by  similar  creatures  for  their  own  benefit.  In  his

minds eye, he sees a nocturnal paradise for his kind, a kingdom

in which vampires may dwell openly and rule the mortals

just as vampires were obviously meant to do.

He  sees  a  kingdom  in  which  mortals  are  enslaved  and

herded like cattle, each existing only to perform menial labor

until its turn comes to sate its masters appetite. He pictures a

grand  palace  here  in  Westgate,  its  fountains  running  with

fresh blood, its many rooms filled with the choicest morsels of

human flesh for his culinary enjoyment. He rejects the notion

that Westgate alone would be enough to satisfy his ambitions.

The Night King intends to include the entire Dragon Coast in

his horrific kingdom. Cormyr, Sembia, the Shining Plainshe

and his minions plan to have them all, and their teeming mil-

lions of mortal lives, for their kingdom of night.

The first stages of the Night Kings plan are already well

under way. One of his first acts as the new Faceless was the re-

shaping of the guild, making it more suited as the instrument

of political terror he requires if he is to achieve his ends. He

has launched what eventually should be a lengthy list of strate-

gic political assassinations in Sembia and Cormyr. The targets

of these killings are nobles and politically powerful merchants

The Vampire Infestation of Westgate

Since completing the formation of his Court of Night Masters,

Orbakh has permitted his servitors to create minion vampires

of  their  own.  The  resulting  undead  population  explosion  has

lead to certain difficulties that, while currently in hand, may

one night lead to complications. The most obvious issue is feed-

ing. Even in a metropolis such as Westgate, the presence of so

many  vampires  can  be  problematic.  The  Night  King  desires

that the existence of the vampire coven remain hidden from

the  mortals  of  the  city  (for  now),  and  sloppy  feeding  habits

could  lead  to  exposure.  The  vampire  lord  therefore  enforces

strict rules that dictate when and where the vampires may feed,

so  that  their  hunting  does  not  attract  undue  attention.  His

most inviolate rule is that no evidence of the vampires feasting

be left for the mortals to discover: All corpses must be disposed

of in a fashion that does not cause the populace to suspect that

vampires  are  among  them.  Even  with  these  precautions,  the

rising number of disappearances that the growing vampire pop-

ulation  inevitably  produces  (and  the  problem  undoubtedly

grows  worse  when  word  spreads  among  vampires  living  else-

where that Westgate offers opportunities for their kind) may

well cause complications for the Night King.

The  Night  King  knows  that  several  popular  misconcep-

tions about vampires exist that aid him and his brood should

the worst occur and their presence be discovered. One impor-

tant  misconception  is  that  vampires  must  return  to  their

coffins at dawn and remain within them, sleeping, during the

day. This is a fallacy, but one that Orbakh is content to prop-

agate. The truth is that vampires are as active in the daylight

hours as they are at night. They are undead creatures and do

not require sleep. Thus it is quite possible for a vampire to

meet with a mortal minion, stalk a victim, conduct research,

or  meet  with  other  vampires  during  daylight  hours.  How-

ever, it is true that direct sunlight is dangerous, even fatal, to

them, and they must avoid it. But provided that they do not

enter  direct  sunlight,  they  may  do  as  they  please,  and  all

their  powers  remain  completely  operative.  Hence,  most  of

the  vampires  in  the  city  stay  in  the  dark  places  below  the

streets and conduct their business there as well. They main-

tain lairs that are well protected from direct sunlight. Many

of them are in the half-drowned sewers and deep catacombs

that  riddle  the  ground  below  Westgate  (the  vampires  take

care to avoid any areas of running water, of course).

The Night Masks

whose interests and views might prove a hindrance or a detri-

ment to the Night Masks plans to expand into those lands. So

far a dozen men and women have fallen to the lethal talents

of the Lady Dahlias killers. Each successful assassination has

coincided with the arrival of one or more Night Masks cells in

the target area; their goal is to take advantage of the destabi-

lization caused by the assassinations and start taking over the

target  areas  criminal  element.  The  cell-level  Night  Masks

members believe only that they are part of the Facelesss plan

to infiltrate and control the underworld in cities beyond West-

gate. They have not the faintest inkling that they are paving

the  way  for  the  creation  of  a  kingdom  that  one  day  might

treat them as little more than herd animals.

Already the Night Masks have infiltrated and taken over

the Astorians, a once-rival thieves guild operating in the city

of Teziir. The Astorians (the Night King chose to leave their

name intact so as to better disguise his activities) are now ac-

tively engaged in an effort to control their home citys under-

world,  a  task  they  should  accomplish  within  the  year.

Following that, they are to begin attempts to corrupt and con-

trol  the  citys  ruling  merchant  council.  Meanwhile,  in  the

nearby city of Starmantle, the Night Masks cells have encoun-

tered little difficulty in assuming the role of the leading pro-

fessional  criminals  in  that  area.  The  Night  King  is  about  to

choose  a  vampire  to  be  sent  to  Starmantle  and  oversee  the

guild cells there. He should be in place by the end of the year

and, if no obstacles present themselves, the Night Masks hope

to soon have control of that city.

Meanwhile, the Night King continues his efforts to cement

his  control  over  Westgate,  his  future  capital  and  the  power

base of his new kingdom. Perhaps it is his sense of ironyor

his vanitythat gives him the desire to legitimize his efforts

by  restoring  the  old  monarchy  of  Westgate  with  himself  on

the  throne.  By  the  time  he  is  crowned,  he  intends  that  the

Night  Masks  should  have  completely  infiltrated  the  major

Dragon Coast cities, assumed control of their underworlds, and

made  solid  inroads  into  their  governments.  As  the  vampire

king of Westgate, he is going to face threats of opposition to

his sovereignty from neighboring lands, but he intends those

places  to  be  so  thoroughly  under  the  control  of  his  Night

Masks that they are unable to offer any genuine threat or re-

sistance when it is their turn to become part of his kingdom.

The old Westgate monarchy is long defunct. But careful his-

torical  and  genealogical  research  enabled  the  Night  King  to

confirm that one last link to that ancient and royal bloodline

survives: the Lady Thistle Thalavar. Lady Thistle is the head

of House Thalavar and thus its representative on Westgates

ruling council. The Night Kings first thought, which amused

him greatly, was to woo the intelligent and aristocratic young

noblewoman in disguise. He adopted the guise of an expatriate

Cormyrian  nobleman  and,  when  not  supposedly  away  at  sea,

began to pursue the lady with the intention of asking for her

hand  in  marriage.  He  abandoned  this  courtship  after  six

months  when  it  became  clear  that  the  fiercely  independent

Lady Thistle had no intention of entering into a state of mat-

rimony with anyone. No longer amused, Orbakh opted for a

more direct means of control: He used his vampiric powers to

subvert Thistles will to his own. He broke her gradually, sa-

voring the slow erosion of her will over the course of several

more  months,  until  she  became  little  more  than  his  puppet.

She continues to function in her roles as head of her family

and council member, but the ladys voice and actions now serve

the  Night  King  rather  than  herself  or  her  house.  When  he

judges  the  time  to  be  auspicious,  Orbakh  intends  to  wed  her

prior to claiming the monarchy of Westgate for himself. Until

then,  she  remains  firmly  under  his  control.  Currently  he  is

considering  making  Lady  Thistle  into  a  vampire,  so  that  he

can preserve his link to the old monarchy for all eternity.

RECRUITING

One might think that an organization with such far-reaching

designs as the Night Masks might seek to swell its membership

rolls by inducting every criminal in the city. The Night King

and his court, however, much prefer quality to quantity. While

it  is  true  that  the  organization  does  recruit  and  employ  a

number  of  relatively  common  criminals,  possessed  of  no  re-

markable  talents,  for  the  bulk  of  its  grunt  work,  the  Night

Masters  nevertheless  understand  the  value  in  recruiting  the

best and most skilled individuals they can find. Operatives in

recruitment  cells  spend  much  of  their  time  observing  newly

arrived  criminals  in  order  to  determine  whether  they  might

merit  closer  scrutiny  as  potential  Night  Masks.  When  a  cell

identifies a prospective member, one of its number approaches

the individual and enlists him or her to carry out a job or mis-

sion to determine worthiness. Those who perform well may be

offered  regular  membership  in  the  guild;  those  who  do  not

may  be  given  a  place  in  the  organizations  lowest  echelon,

where they must claw their way upward or perish quickly. The

more unusual a candidates capabilities, the more highly sought

he is. The guild has no shortage of common rogues, but the tal-

ents of a skilled assassin, monk, or bard are harder to come by,

even in a city as corrupt as Westgate.

Regardless of membership, no criminalsindividual or or-

ganizedoperate in the city of Westgate without the express

permission of the Night Masks. Those who disdain the guilds

claim to supremacy and insist on engaging in criminal activi-

ties  without  its  blessing  may  escape  detection  for  a  short

timea few days, perhapsbut inevitably their activities are

noticed by one or more of the many eyes that serve the Face-

less and his followers. Through the Twilight Knight, the Face-

less  enforces  a  rigid  policy  toward  such  transgressors.  They

receive one opportunity to either purchase a guild membership

or leave the city forever, never to return. Those who refuse to

accept one of these options are, of course, murdered and their

corpses left as warnings. Such is the guilds success rate at iden-

tifying  nonguild  operatives  and  enforcing  its  policy  that  re-

markably few visiting criminals are willing to risk its ire.

ALLIES

The nature of this organization does not lend itself to making

friends. However, the Night Masks can count on several allies

of convenience that either work for or with the thieves guild.

Chief among these are the Astorians, the leading thieves guild

of Teziir, which the Night Masks have infiltrated and now all

but control. The Astorians know that their future is now inex-

tricably intertwined with that of the Night Masks, and so co-

operate with their partners with reasonable efficiency.

The Fire Knives, on the other hand, are a different sort of

ally.  Most  of  the  general  members  of  the  Night  Masks

remain unaware that the Faceless has been manipulating this

gang of assassins ever since he first gained leadership of the

thieves guild. Exiled from their homeland of Cormyr in 1341

DR,  the  members  of  the  noble  houses  of  Bleth  and  Cor-

maerilthe leaders and members of the Fire Knivesintend

to assassinate those Cormyrians who oppose their return. This

seems like a marvelous plan to the Night King, who permits

the assassins to exist and operate in Westgate in return for the

use of their unique talents, all the while manipulating some of

their junior members into believing that the Knives stand a

better chance of achieving a swift return to Cormyr if they

subordinate themselves completely to the Masks. The leaders

of the Fire Knives suspect the Night Kings true nature and

are beginning to feel his influence on their organization. (See

the Fire Knives entry.)

ENEMIES

The Night Masks consider any who hinder their nightly goals

and operations to be their enemies, and deal with them quickly

and decisively.

The caravan merchant who attempts to undercut the guild

by smuggling goods into the city without permission from the

Count of Storms is the enemy of the Night Masks. Once dis-

covered, that merchant dies and his goods are confiscated. The

weapons  merchant  who  falls  behind  in  his  protection  pay-

ments is the enemy of the Night Masks.

The do-gooder adventurers who cant seem to resist stick-

ing  their  noses  where  they  dont  belong  are  the  enemies  of

the Night Masks. Maybe they find themselves framed for a

burglary and cast into the city dungeons, or perhaps they are

murdered in their beds as they sleep. A particularly trouble-

some adventurer might merit the attention of a lieutenant,

or  possibly  (if  the  interloper  is  very  unlucky)  the  Court  of

Night Masters.

As for more specific foes, the one garnering the lions share

of  the  Night  Masters  attention  at  this  time  is  High  Lord

Abbot Grigor Khazaar, a militant cleric of Tyr. Based at the

newly constructed Abbey of the Blinding Truth in the Kings

March, the High Lord Abbot and his clergy have made it their

business  to  interfere  with  Night  Masks  operations  whenever

possible. Clerics, monks, and paladins devoted to the Just Deity

have clashed increasingly with operatives of the thieves guild

in  recent  months,  and  the  Night  Masks  have  suffered  from

these altercations.

The Night Masters are more than a little concerned about

this. All attempts to infiltrate the new abbey or acquire hard

information  about  the  religious  leader  and  his  temples  de-

fenses have proven ineffectual, leaving the organization with-

out  adequate  intelligence  about  this  threat.  The  Night  King

himself  is  aware  of  the  danger  posed  by  these  interfering

moralists,  and  while  he  dares  not  show  it  openly  he,  too,  is

troubled. If the cleric discovers the true nature of the Faceless,

the abbey will bring all its resources to bear in an attempt to

topple the Night Masks.

The High Lord Abbot has gone so far as to lobby the mem-

bers of the noble council in an attempt to convince them to

Wake  up  and  realize  the  injustice  that  is  being  perpetrated

nightly  in  the  city  streets,  often  by  agents  of  the  council

itself!  Grigor  seems  to  have  found  a  sympathetic  ear  in  old

Scirkas  Urdo,  one  of  the  most  conservative  members  of  the

council. Thistle Thalavar has reported to her master Orbakh

that Scirkas has several times in recent nights invited the High

Lord Abbot to dine with him privately, and once attended a

service at the abbeys chapel. Orbakh has considered ordering

Grigor  Khazaars  assassination,  but  has  delayed  for  fear  that

the  clerics  martyrdom  could  bring  even  greater  numbers  of

Tyrs followers to the city.

Perhaps  the  most  consistent  and  troublesome  enemies  of

the Night Masks are the Harpers. Ironically, the Night Kings

campaign  to  become  the  Faceless  was  made  possible  when

Those  Who  Harp  toppled  his  predecessor.  Despite  this  assis-

tance, he feels no gratitude toward these meddlers. Anyone sus-

pected of being a Harper must be reported through channels

until the news reaches the ears of the Duke of Whispers, whose

task  it  is  to  confirm  the  information.  A  half-dozen  Harpers

have been identified since this edict was issued, each one appre-

hended in turn and brought before the Court of Night Masters

for a brief but thorough interrogation before being drained of

every last drop of blood.

Unsurprisingly, the Night Masks campaign of aggression

in  the  organized  crime  syndicates  of  various  cities  has  at-

tracted  the  attention  and  opposition  of  merchant  societies

such as the Knights of the Shield, the Men of the Basilisk, and

the  Rundeen.  Thus  far,  however,  none  of  these  enemies  has

been  able  to  deliver  any  meaningful  blows  to  the  Night

Masks operation.

Encounters

Agents of the Night Masks can be encountered in virtually all

parts of Westgate. Encounters with operatives of the thieves

guild in neighboring cities are less common, but quite possible

in  those  communities  that  are  home  to  one  or  more  Night

Masks  cells.  The  typical  encounter  with  the  Night  Masks  is

with  a  group  of  criminals  engaged  in  their  primary  trade:  a

pair of toughs, for example, en route to roust a merchant who

is behind in his protection money, or a trio of street operatives

who  attempt  to  mug  and  roll  the  player  characters  outside

their favorite tavern.

The Night Masks

The Secret Haven of the

Court of Night Masters

Orbakh and his four dukesDahlia, Phultan, Tebryn, and the

Twilight Knighthave numerous private meeting places and

temporary boltholes located throughout Westgate. This, how-

ever, is the communal lair where the quartet of dukes keeps

their  coffins.  Here  the  Night  King  and  his  dukes  meet  to

review  their  successes  and  lay  their  plans  for  the  future.

(Orbakh himself has a separate lair elsewhere in the city.) This

secret place, located deep within the stinking and treacherous

sewers of Westgate, is where the vampires retreat to if sorely

pressed,  or  if  circumstances  demand  a  strategic  withdrawal

from  the  field  and  a  return  to  their  coffins.  Each  of  these

four vampires usually keeps at least one fresh mortal victim

imprisoned  here  (see  below)  in  order  to  satisfy  cravings  for

fresh blood.

LOCATING THE LAIR

Unless you have the ability to teleport directly into the lair,

take on gaseous form in order to seep through grates and small

sewer  pipes,  or  perhaps  transform  into  a  bat  in  order  to  flit

downward through unscalable vertical shaftsand in all these

instances  know  exactly  where  to  go  so  as  to  avoid  becoming

hopelessly lost in the half-drowned, monster-plagued sewers of

Westgateyou must seek the only path to the lair that can be

discovered and negotiated safely by mortal folk.

Starting from a particular grating in the Harbor Loop road,

an old iron ladder leads30 feet downward to a horizontal sewer

tunnel. The tunnel runs 140 feet under the road, leading even-

tually  to  a  tunnel  somewhere  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Rosebud

Tavern.  A  dozen  vertical  drainage  shafts  exit  the  junction.

Most lead only to other shafts and tunnels and eventually to

the harbor, but one goes to to a slimy, water-filled brick cham-

ber 120 feet below the citys streets. (The water in this chamber

is stagnant, posing no threat to vampires who use this route to

access the lair.) Opening a secret door below the chambers wa-

terline reveals a narrow horizontal, brick-lined passageway that

leads downward at a slope of 20 degrees. The passage meets an-

other, older sewer tunnel after 50 yards, and this in turn leads

westward to a large, circular chamber that was once a collection

point for storm water that passed deep under the city and out

into  the  harbor  via  a  grating  near  the  Thorsar  docks.  This

chamber is located just to the north of Castle Vhammos. It is

immediately  apparent  upon  entering  the  drainage  chamber

that this is a place where the unwary will fare poorly at best.

LAIR HISTORY AND OVERVIEW

The Night King and his dukes have renovated both the ancient

drain chamber and the abandoned temple that lies nearby. As

near  as  Orbakh  can  determine,  the  temple  and  its  secret  en-

trance were created in or around 1117 DR, when King Alzurth

and his Knights of the Silent Skull held Westgate in an iron

grip of terror (the Night King can only admire such a figure).

He  discovered  the  place  shortly  after  awakening  from  stasis

and noted its location as the perfect site in which to establish

his  lair.  He  hired  craftsfolk  to  help  him  renovate  the  aban-

doned temple and construct the false lair, slaying the workers

after  their  labors  were  completed  so  that  none  could  reveal

what they knew. Only he and the dukes are aware of the lairs

exact situation. (He revealed its location to the dukes as he cre-

ated them, one by one.)

1. The False Lair

This  place  is  dimly  lit  by  massive  wrought  iron  candelabras,

each sporting a number of large white tapers with flames that

flicker  and  gutter  in  the  chill  drafts  that  swirl  periodically

upward from the large iron grating located in the center of the

floor.  Dominating  the  room  is  a  raised  stone  platform  sup-

porting a quartet of carved stone coffins. Near one of the two

tunnels leading into this place is what appears to be a single

rectangle of roughly carved stone, possibly an altar. Above, the

domed ceiling rises to a height of 30 feet at its highest point

above the floor, which is constructed (like the walls and ceil-

ing) of masonry stained dark with countless decades of water

and filth. An unpleasantly wet odor, reminiscent of a slaugh-

terhouse situated near the ocean, permeates the entire cham-

ber, waxing stronger when the drafts rise from the grating.

The candles in this chamber are under the effect of a con-

tinual flame spell.

2. Hanging Victims

A  large  iron  grating  25  feet  across  occupies  a  section  of  the

chamber floor, slightly offset from its center. Encircling and

attached to the outer edge of the grating is a ring of iron, 1

foot in diameter and 6 inches thick, that provides a surface for

the  big  iron  rivets  that  hold  the  grate  in  place  on  the  brick

floor. At four equidistant points around this iron collar are af-

fixed great chains that ascend upward, joining together before

disappearing into the shadows. Sufficient lighting reveals that

the  chains  are  attached  to  a  huge  pulley-and-gear  system

meant for raising the grating.

No Listen check is required for anyone who comes within 10

feet of the grating to hear the pitiful noises made by the vam-

pires victims, who await their tragic fate in iron cages suspended

by more chains from the bars of the grating. The cages can be

seen from the floor of the chamber by standing next to the grat-

ing and illuminating the shaft with adequate light (which imme-

diately causes the prisoners to cry out and beg for help, alerting

the vampires in area 8 to the presence of intruders). Each of the

six cages is approximately 3 feet in diameter and swings 20 feet

below the center of the grate. Walking along the surface of the

grating requires a Balance check (DC 20). If the check fails, the

character slips on the loose rust covering the grating and falls

into the drain shaft. A successful Climb check (DC 30) allows

the character to grab part of the grating and hang on to prevent

himself from falling. If the character fails this save, he is per-

mitted  one  last  Climb  check  (DC  25),  which  enables  him  to

grasp one of the cages on his way down. Climbing up the side of

a cage to reach its chain requires a Climb check (DC 15), as does

climbing the chain back up to the grating (DC 20).

Pulling a cage up to the grating requires the muscle to haul

up approximately 800 pounds of cage and victim, plus a Balance

check (DC 20) to keep from falling into the shaft as the cage

swings to and fro during its ascent. A cage can fit between the

spaces separating the grating bars easily. All are secured with a

simple padlock (Open Lock DC 20). Victims released from im-

prisonment report that they awakened in this place after a noc-

turnal encounter in the city above with terrible, pallid creatures

The Night Masks

that had long fangs and great strength. The victims are unable

to tell rescuers anything useful about the lair and wish only to be

led back to the surface.

3. False Altar

At first glance this 10-foot-long block of carved granite ap-

pears  to  be  some  sort  of  altar,  covered  as  it  is  with  dark

stains that were certainly made by aged, spilled blood. Closer

inspection, however, fails to reveal any hint of the deity or

deities to which the altar might be dedicated. The four side

panels of the altar are pressure plates. Touching any of them

activates a trap that causes blocks of stone to fall from the

ceiling.

Falling Block Trap: CR 5; +15 melee (8d6); Search (DC 20);

Disable Device (DC 25); can strike all characters in all squares

immediately adjacent to the altar.

4. Trapped Teleporter

This  block  of  hewn  granite,  rising  3  feet  off  the  floor  and

reached by a shallow flight of stone steps, seems somewhat in-

congruous in that it is clearly a more recent addition and not

part of the rooms original design. The block is imbued with

two types of magic: a permanent teleportation circle (leading

to the corresponding circle in area 11), and a glyph of warding

triggered by any nonevil creature stepping onto the platform.

The glyph detonates simultaneously with the activation of the

teleportation circlea nonevil creature is teleported but may

arrive at its destination wounded from the blasting force of

the trap.

Glyph  of  Warding: CR  3;  5-ft.  blast;  5d8  electricity

damage; Reflex half (DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device

(DC 28).

5. False Coffins

The chamber is dominated by the morbid sight of four worked

stone coffins that rest side by side upon a raised platform of

basalt. A flight of stone steps leads up to either end of the plat-

form and the coffins; the top of the platform is 4 feet above

the chamber floor. Each of the coffins is trapped.

Coffin A: This coffin is crafted of plain stone without orna-

mentation. The lid is heavy, weighing about 500 pounds, but it

is otherwise not secured. The coffin interior is approximately 3

feet deep, but a mirror seals off half its depth. Etched into the

mirror is writing in an unfamiliar tongue. The arrangement of

the text suggests a poem or ballad, but the script is, in fact, ex-

plosive runes that trigger a more dangerous trap.

Trap: Reading the etched text detonates the explosive runes,

which in addition to dealing their normal damage also shatter the

mirror, igniting what lies beneath its surfacea quantity of al-

chemists fire, sealed against the air in a tank of glass that has a

mirror for a top. The blast sends the alchemists fire hurtling out

of the coffin and up into the air to scatter in a deadly rain over

the  immediate  vicinity.  The  quantity  of  alchemists  fire  inside

the coffin is equal to that of a dozen flasks, and when the trap is

sprung they are divided evenly among the six squares closest to

this edge of the platform on which the coffin rests. All creatures

within 5 feet of the alchemists fire take splash damage, includ-

ing those affected by a different flask. The noise of this trap as

it activates is sufficient to alert the servitor vampires in area 8.

Explosive Runes: CR 3; 5-ft. blast (6d6); Reflex half within

10 ft. (DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

Alchemists Fire Trap (12): CR 2; +5 ranged touch (1d6 fire

plus 1d6 on the next round, 1 splash); Search (DC 25); Disable

Device (DC 28).

Night Masks: Tips for the DM

The general membership of the guild is completely unaware

that  its  masters  are  a  coven  of  blood-drinking  undead.  In

fact,  most  members  of  the  Night  Masks  never  meet  the

Faceless or any of the dukes in person. The highest-ranking

individual that most of the lower echelon ever encounters is

a  count.  Such  a  meeting  usually  occurs  only  if  the  guild

member in question is in a position either to report directly

to a member of the Court of Night, or has done something to

attract a counts personal attention (and thats almost never

a  good  thing).  The  primary  motivation  for  most  of  the

street-level  Night  Masks  members  is  to  gain  wealthpro-

vided that guild operations remain as profitable as they have

become  since  the  new  Faceless  took  over,  its  unlikely  that

the  Court  of  Night  worries  about  a  coup  from  the  lower

ranks.  Usurpation  from  within  the  court  itself  is  another

matter entirely, of course.

You  could  easily  build  an  entire  campaign  around  the

Night  Masks  by  using  them  as  the  chief  antagonist  of  the

story.  The  organization  is  growing  so  quickly  and  its  reach

extending so far beyond Westgate that it poses an imminent

threat  to  the  entire  Dragon  Reach.  If  left  unchecked,  it  is

quite possible that Orbakh makes good on his promise to es-

52

tablish a kingdom of vampires first in Westgate and then in

the lands beyond. To make the Night Masks the central an-

tagonists  of  a  new  campaign,  start  small.  Have  the  player

characters run afoul of the guilds more mundane NPCs and

activities  either  in  Westgate  or  maybe  in  one  of  the  other

cities along the Dragon Reach, and then build on those en-

counters to slowly reveal the truth behind the organization

and  its  real  goals.  The  player  characters  or  their  associates

might even be the targets of a low-level Night Masks opera-

tion,  putting  the  heroes  and  the  guild  in  opposition  right

away.

Regardless of how you decide to utilize the Night Masks,

remember not to reveal everything about them immediately.

Peel away the layers of secrecy that surround the Night Mas-

ters, unveiling the vampires only when the player characters

are prepared to take on such powerful creatures. You might

add an encounter with a relatively weak servitor vampire

perhaps sent to deter the player characters from involving

themselves any deeper in the affairs of the Night Masks

before bringing one of the Night Masters into the picture.

Pursuing  the  vampire  lords  into  their  sewer  lair  makes  a

great climactic encounter for the campaign.

The Night Masks

Coffin  B: Ornate  bas-relief  carvings  decorate  the  lid  and

body of this stone coffin. The art depicts what seem to be var-

ious events in the life of an individual who appears in all the

scenes. The figure is male, with shoulder-length hair, a muscu-

lar  build,  and  a  pronounced  set  of  canine  teeth  that  extend

below his upper lip. Anyone who has ever met or seen the true

appearance of Orbakh notices the resemblance if he or she suc-

ceeds at a Wisdom check (DC 13). Dressed in what seem to be

robes that were fashionable in the Moonsea area two centuries

ago, the figure engages in the following scenes. The lid depicts

the figure as he supervises the impalement upon tall wooden

spikes  of  a  number  of  armored  soldiers.  One  of  the  coffins

sides shows him conducting a worship or prayer service that in-

volves the ritual sacrifice of a pair of youths (one male, one

female)  who  are  bound  hand  and  foot  before  an  altar  as  a

number  of  well-dressed,  kneeling  worshipers  or  supplicants

look on. The opposite side depicts him seated atop an ornate

throne as servants bring him goblets on serving platters from

either side. One end of the coffin shows the figure armed and

armored for battle in a suit of splendid half-plate armor, while

the opposite end depicts the same armored figure leaning on a

greatsword as he surveys a heaped pile of skulls.

Trap: The coffin, the floor on which it rests, and the floor ad-

jacent to it rest on metal pins that slide away if the lid of the

coffin is removed, sending the coffin and floor plunging down-

ward into a lightless, water-filled pit. Activating this trap makes

a noise loud enough to alert the servitor vampires in area 8.

Pit Trap (80 ft. deep): CR 4; no attack roll necessary (8d6);

Reflex  save  (DC  20)  avoids;  Search  (DC  20);  Disable  Device

(DC 20). Water is 15 feet deep.

Coffin C: This coffin is covered by a finely woven cloth-of-

gold. The cloth is valuable (2,500 gp) but otherwise mundane.

Trap: Removing the cloth reveals a glyph of warding on the

coffin lid.

Glyph of Warding: CR 3; 5-ft. fire blast (5d8); Reflex half

(DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

Coffin D: Like its companions, this coffin is made of stone,

and it is without ornamentation. However, a Search check (DC

16) reveals that the coffin rests on metal rollers that allow it

to be pushed aside.

Trap: When the coffin is rolled away, a cloud of poison gas

billows upward, affecting all living creatures within 10 feet of

the coffin. Rolling away the lid creates a loud noise that alerts

the servitor vampires in area 8.

Poison  Gas  (insanity  mist): CR  4;  1d4  Wis  plus  2d6  Wis;

Fort save DC 15; Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20).

6. Winch Assembly

A wooden and metal box is affixed to the wall directly opposite

the  false  coffins.  The  wooden  portion  of  the  box  is  partially

The Most Dangerous Game

Eldaerneth Spellstalker is one of the very few full-blooded elven

members of the Night Masks. He plays the dangerous game of

pretending to be a loyal member of the guild while using it for

his  own  ends.  He  is  actually  a  senior  member  of  the  Eldreth

Veluuthra, a fanatical group of elf supremacists (see the Minor

Organizations  section).  He  joined  the  Night  Masks  as  a  free-

lance wizard and proved so valuable and (apparently) loyal that

he earned a promotion to the middle levels of the hierarchy. He

does not know that the leaders of the guild are vampires. El-

daerneths  life  is  in  jeopardy  every  moment:  If  any  other

member  of  the  guild  discovered  that  he  uses  his  position  to

funnel information back to the Eldreth Veluuthra, he would be

forced to flee Westgate immediately or be destroyed. He despises

the humans and half-elves with whom he must cooperate as part

of his cover, but the knowledge that he serves the Victorious

Blade of the People enables him to carry on. Adventurers may

face this Night Masks operative if they annoy the organization

sufficiently; if the adventurers are humans or half-elves, Eldaer-

neth does not find the assignment objectionable.

The Night Masks

rotted  away,  revealing  a  set  of  rusting  gears  within.  A  huge

iron chain runs from the flywheel upward to a pulley assem-

bly located near the ceiling of the chamber and directly above

the grating.

Attached to the gears and protruding from the side of the

box is a metal winch handle, large enough for three Medium-

size creatures to grasp simultaneously. The assembly is so thor-

oughly rusted and in such a state of disrepair that turning the

handle (which requires a combined Strength score of at least

30)  results  in  an  immediate  and  very  loud  sound  of  metal

shrieking in protest as flakes of rust explode from the handle

and flywheel. This sound alerts the servitor vampires in area 8

to the presence of intruders.

7. Illusory Wall

A section of the chambers eastern wall is an illusory wall that

leads directly into area 8.

8. Hall of Misted Death

Characters passing through the illusory wall find themselves

peering into a corridor filled with dense fog that obscures all

sight  (including  darkvision)  beyond  5  feet.  This  effect  is  the

result of solid fog spells made permanent.

Spaced  regularly  along  both  sides  of  the  central  hallway

are  niches,  cut  5  feet  deep  into  the  rock,  each  containing  a

plainly carved stone coffin standing upright upon the rough

flagstone  floor.  Half  of  the  coffins  are  empty  (but  they  do

have their lids in place) and not noteworthy in any way. The

other  half  are  the  resting  places  of  servitor  vampires,  each

formerly a warrior in the employ of the Night Masks and cre-

ated by one of the dukes specifically to serve as guardians for

their masters lair.

The eastern end of the hallway dead-ends in a wall of ma-

sonry of visibly more recent construction than the hallway. In

the center of the masonry wall near its juncture with the hall-

way ceiling, at a height of about 9 feet, are three holeseach

no more than an inch in diameterarranged in a triangle. The

holes  penetrate  the  masonry  wall,  allowing  the  vampires  a

means  of  access  to  and  from  the  hidden  temple  while  in

gaseous form. The masonry wall is 1 foot thick (hardness 8, hp

90, break DC 35).

Children  of  the  Night  (Su): Each  vampire  can  call  forth

from the sewers a pack of 4d8 dire rats or a swarm of 10d10

bats as a standard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds

and serve the vampire that called them for up to 1 hour.

Possessions (each): +3 chain shirt, +2 longsword, ring of free-

dom of movement.

Tactics: If any of the coffin traps in area 1 are activated, the

servitor vampires hear the noise and are alerted to the presence

of intruders. They do not leave the fog-shrouded hall, however,

but rather prepare themselves to attack any that discover this

route to their masters true lair. Exiting a coffin is a move-equiv-

alent action.

Two of the servitor vampires ascend the wall on either side of

the  hallway  with  their  spider  climb  ability,  positioning  them-

selves  on  the  ceiling  just  inside  the  entrance,  where  they  can

attack by leaping onto enemies who pass below (hoping to catch

them  flat-footed).  The  remaining  three  servitor  vampires

assume gaseous form. It is almost impossible to distinguish them

from the fog itself (Spot check DC 30). They wait for the best

moment to strike at intruders who enter the corridor.

If the intruders do not set off any of the coffin traps, and if

the intruders do not make any other loud sounds, the servitor

vampires are not aware of the intruders presence until they

pass through the illusory wall. In this case, the servitor vam-

pires exit their coffins and attack the intruders. The vampires

make good use of their ability to ignore the limitations placed

on movement by the solid fog. If the intruders successfully dis-

perse or remove the solid fog, the vampires summon dire rats

or bats (equal chance of either) to aid them. Should the fight

go  badly  for  the  servitor  vampires,  at  least  one  assumes

gaseous form and enters the hidden temple via the door tubes

to give warning of the approaching danger. The servitor vam-

pires are incapable of surrendering, regardless of the odds they

might face or how badly the tide of battle may turn against

them, since they are completely under the control of the vam-

pires that created them.

THE HIDDEN TEMPLE

9. Ancient Worship Chamber

The smooth stone floor of this wide, circular chamber becomes

a twin row of seats arranged in opposed semicircles, creating a

small auditorium. Four sets of stone steps lead down about 5

feet  to  the  auditorium  floor.  To  the  right,  the  auditorium

opens directly onto a wide hallway flanked by a double row of

stone pillars. To the left, at the opposite end of the auditorium,

stands an empty, round dais hewn from black stone.

The temples original denizens once gathered in this subter-

ranean  auditorium  to  participate  in  religious  prayers,  medita-

tions, and ceremonies prescribed by their faith. All their religious

trappings are vanished now, giving no hint of the nature or iden-

tity of their deity.

The only unusual feature of the room is the black dais. A Spot

check (DC 15) enables a character to determine that the top of

the  dais  is  slightly  indented,  suggesting  that  something  quite

heavy once rested atop its bulk.

10. Altar Hall

A double row of slim columns march off toward the far end of

this  wide  hallway,  supporting  the  vaulted  ceiling  that  arches

20 feet overhead. Located at the farthest end of this hall is a

huge altar, 6 feet high and 10 feet wide, carved from a single

54

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  11:03 AM  Page 55

Red Wizards of Thay

block of basalt. Lady Dahlia, the Duchess of Death, has con-

verted this altar for the worship of Shar, her patron deity. A

three-dimensional  representation  of  the  deitys  emblem,  a

black  disk  with  a  deep  purple  border,  rests  in  a  niche  carved

into the face of the altar. Resting atop the altar are a pair of

black pillar candles that have never been lit. If Dahlia is pres-

ent in the temple when intruders arrive, she is most likely to

be found somewhere in this hallbefore the altar if she is not

alerted  to  the  intruders  presence,  or  lying  in  wait  for  them

among the pillars if she knows they are here.

11. Audience Chamber

The dominating feature of this candlelit circular chamber is a

throne  situated  on  the  wall  opposite  the  entrance,  carved

from  a  single  block  of  onyx  and  polished  to  a  mirrorlike

sheen. A series of expensive tapestries depicting vile scenes of

bloodletting  cover  the  chamber  walls  from  its  smooth  flag-

stone  floor  to  its  15-foot-high  ceiling.  A  single,  3-foot-high

block of hewn granite stands alone on the wall near the cham-

ber entrance.

This is without question the very worst place in Westgate

to be if one is not a member of the Court of Night Masters,

for here the Night King holds court. When the court meets,

Orbakh  ascends  his  onyx  throne  and  presides  over  the  con-

clave  of  vampires  as  they  discuss  matters  ranging  from  the

status  of  Night  Masks  operations  to  their  progress  toward

their  true  goal.  The  candles  in  this  chamber  are  under  the

effect of a continual flame spell. The block of granite is in-

scribed with a teleportation circle made permanent. Creatures

that step onto the block are teleported to the corresponding

block in room 1. The vampires created these devices in case

they were somehow prevented from exiting the hidden temple

by assuming gaseous form.

12. Tunnel of Doom

The flagstones that mark the other areas of this complex sud-

denly give way to this natural rock tunnel.

The entrance to the vampires lair is protected by a perma-

nent maw of stone spell. The animated tunnel attacks any non-

vampire  attempting  to  enter  or  exit  the  cavern.  The  tunnel

makes a grapple attack against each nonvampire in the tunnel

every round. It has a +30 melee attack bonus and a Strength

score  of  30.  If  the  tunnel  succeeds  on  its  grab  attempt,  it

makes a grapple check and deals 2d6+10 points of damage if

successful. The animated stone has AC 15, hardness 8, and 60

hit points.

13. The True Lair

This  natural  stone  tunnel  ends  in  a  narrow  entrance  to  this

circular,  worked-stone  chamber.  Resting  on  the  rough  stone

floor equidistant from one another are four iron coffins.

The  vampires  of  the  Court  of  Night  Masters  flee  to  their

coffins  if  they  ever  find  themselves  reduced  to  0  hit  points.

Each of these coffins is protected externally by a symbol of hope-

lessness engraved into its lid and triggered when any nonvam-

pire  looks  at  it.  The  coffins  are  also  protected  by  an  internal

mechanism that allows the vampire to secure the lid from inside

the coffin.

Red Wizards of Thay

Yes, good sir Rhistel, these are all excellent choices. The Red

Wizard  pushed  four  vials  across  the  wooden  countertop,  each

marked with the flame of Thay and the flag of Proskur. Is

there anything else we can help you with?

The sun elf paused, scratched the long scar on his chin, and

thought about his companions waiting back at the inn. Yes, well

need  an  endurance  potion,  one  of  eagles  splendor,  and  one  of

haste. Standard discount?

Of course.

The elf counted his coins while the tattooed mage located the

requested items, then asked, Is Urhun Kren working today?

I believe so, the Red Wizard replied.

Good. His protective tattoo came in quite handy, and Id like

him to make another.

If you are as frequent a customer there as you are here, I

am sure he would be happy to oblige.

A fierce tattooed face suddenly peered through the doorway,

a  warrior  with  proud  Thayan  features  clad  in  chain  mail.

Wizard Thazal Tabar, is anything amiss here?

No,  Arzel  Phen.  All  is  calm.  Carry  on.  The  woman

nodded, then departed.

Those knights of yours give me the chills, the elf said with

an exaggerated shudder.

They are our protectors. They are here to combat those who

would  harm  us.  Not  everyone  in  this  part  of  the  world  is  as

friendly to us as you.

Yes,  some  of  my  own  friends  seem  to  distrust  your  wares,

which is why I come here alone. But your magic has served me

well.

Im gratified to hear it. By the by, Tarithi wishes me to tell

you that the apothecary has more of your ziran.

An  eager  look  appeared  in  the  elfs  eyes.  Excellent.  Good

day, Thazal Tabar.

And to you, sir Rhistel. Your business is always welcome here.

After the elf left, the Red Wizard laced his fingers and smiled.

The fool was already addicted. He would be back for more.

Long considered a threat to peace in eastern Faern, the Red

Wizards of Thay have a history of war and aggression toward

their neighbors and even more distant lands. In recent years,

they  have  also  become  the  principal  purveyors  of  magical

goods to the powerful, wealthy, and the desperate throughout

much  of  Faern.  Ensconced  in  secretive  walled  enclaves  in

dozens of cities, the Red Wizards command fear and respect

far outside the borders of their native Thay. These mercantile

enclaves  have  become  so  successful  that  many  Red  Wizards

have abandoned their dreams of military conquest for a more

insidious and pervasive form of powerthe power of gold.

The  Red  Wizards  efforts  to  export  their  magical  goods

abroad have resulted in three main benefits for the Thayans.

First, people of distant lands are beginning to view the Red

Wizards  as  mysterious,  perhaps  intimidating,  merchants,

rather than as would-be conquerors. Second, the sale of magic

items, even at a discount, is a phenomenal source of revenue

for the Red Wizards. Much of this wealth flows back to the

coffers  of  the  zulkirs  (the  leaders),  who  use  the  profits  to

fund  magical  research,  espionage,  and  whatever  terrible

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  11:04 AM  Page 56

Red Wizards of Thay

secret interests they may have. Finally, demand for Thayan

goods is so high that the Red Wizards can exact significant

concessions  from  local  rulers  anxious  to  bring  some  of  the

wealth generated by a Thayan enclave into their cities. The

trade enclaves provide the Red Wizards with secure bases of

operation, spy networks, and resources abroad.

The  zulkirs  may  still  be  creating  terrible  battle  spells

and monstrous magical war machines in the secrecy

of  their  homeland,  but  the  public  facade  of  the

Red  Wizards  has  become  that  of  reliable,  if

eerie, traders in magic.

Brief History

The history of the Red Wizards and Thay is

fully  covered  in  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting. In short, a group of Mulho-

randi  wizards  seceded  from  their  homeland  to

form a country where wizards ruled instead of god-

kings.  These  wizards  eventually  created  the  current

governmental  structure  in  Thay  and  warred  against  their

neighbors  intermittently  for  centuries,  with  their  plans  often

thrown into chaos because of arguing factions within the upper

levels of the organization. While the more aggressive factions

still plot and scheme, other Red Wizardsnotably the zulkirs of

Abjuration,  Illusion,  and  Transmutationhave  turned  their

hand  to  a  burgeoning  trade  in  magic  items,  carried  out  in

Thayan enclaves in cities throughout Faern.

The Organization

While the details of Thay are summarized in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting, the following statistics reflect the

Red Wizards (characters with levels in the Red Wizard pres-

tige class) and their apprentices of various levels (those with-

out levels in the prestige class).

Headquarters: Thaymount, Thay.

Members: Approximately  1,000  actual  Red  Wizards,  with

approximately 5,000 practicing wizards in their service.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leaders: The  zulkirs  of  Thay  (loose  council  of  eight  Red

Wizards,  each  specialized  in  a  different  school  of  arcane

magic).

Religions: Kossuth, Bane, Shar, Loviatar.

Alignment: LE, NE, LN, CE.

Secrecy: None.

Symbol: A  disk  with  a  white  star  at  the  center  and  a  red

spiral moving counterclockwise from the center, with eight red

spheres of increasing size on the spiral. The red represents the

Red  Wizards,  the  eight  spheres  represent  the  eight  primary

schools of magic, and the white star represents a fading fireball.

The Red Wizards rule Thay as the heads of a large quasi-mili-

tary organization, the structure of which is more convoluted

than it first appears.

Among  Thayans,  the  terms  wizard  and  Red  Wizard

have  different  meanings.  A  wizard  is  someone  who  wields

arcane power in the form of spells. (While bards and sorcerers

are  known  in  Thay,  the  Red  Wizards  consider  them  inferior

and treat them as such.) Although wizards may grow powerful,

and that power deserves respect, only Red Wizards command

true authority in Thay.

A Red Wizard is a practicing wizard who has been indoctri-

nated  into  the  outermost  circle  of  Thayan  politics.  In  Thay,

only Red Wizards are allowed to wear red robes, and those who

violate this law are swiftly caught and slowly tortured, usually

in  a  public  manner.  To  avoid  even  the  threat  of  such  a

punishment, most Thayans never wear anything red,

and  some  refuse  to  don  orange  clothing  as  well.

The only exceptions are the clerics of Kossuth,

who stand outside the ban and are easily recog-

nized by their holy symbols and their multi-

colored robes.

While  most  people  outside  Thay  believe

that all Thayan wizards are Red Wizards, this

is not true. Only about one wizard in six is ac-

tually a Red Wizard. The rest are apprentices,

low-level  wizards,  those  unconcerned  with  poli-

tics,  and  those  who  have  not  yet  proved  their

worth to Thay. In game terms, only characters with

levels in the Red Wizard prestige class are called Red Wiz-

ards (although devious and foolish individuals may claim the

title outside Thay with the intent to fool others). Choosing to

become a Red Wizard requires careful thought, for while that

path holds great power, the Red Wizard loses some of a tradi-

tional wizards versatility (by being obliged to select an addi-

tional prohibited school of spellcasting). Many wizards delay

joining  the  Red  Wizards  for  as  long  as  possible,  hoping  that

their wider variety of spells compensates for their shortcom-

ings compared to those who donned the red robes earlier.

HIERARCHY

Thay is ruled by eight zulkirs, each a powerful Red Wizard spe-

cialized in one of the eight schools of magic. When an existing

zulkir  leaves  office  (usually  through  death,  although  zulkir

Szass Tam has been a lich for hundreds of years), a new zulkir

is  selected  by  the  Red  Wizards,  with  powerful  Red  Wizards

holding  more  sway  in  the  choice  and  the  remaining  zulkirs

having the final say.

The Bureaucracy

The  zulkirs  appoint  eleven  tharchions,  one  for  each  of  the

countrys tharchs (counties or provinces). The tharchions act

as  governors  for  their  regions,  dealing  with  local  issues  and

obeying  the  orders  of  the  zulkirs.  The  tharchions  may  be  of

any character class, and some Red Wizards see this duty as a

means of acquiring political power and eventually a position as

a zulkir. Currently, one of the tharchions is also a zulkir, al-

though this is a rare situation.

The  tharchions  appoint  local  bureaucrats,  called  autharchs,

into positions at various levels. Autharchs function as mayors,

military leaders, and ministers of various organizations such as

trade  guilds.  Most  autharchs  have  little  authority  and  serve

mainly as convenient scapegoats for occasions when a zulkirs or

tharchions plans go awry. The autharchs suffer a high turnover

rate, since incompetent ones vanish or are killed and competent

ones are promoted. The leader of a trade enclave, called a khaz-

ark, technically has an equivalent rank to an autharch running a

very  profitable  guild  in  an  equivalent-sized  city,  although  the

khazark tends to have higher status because he or she is always a

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  11:05 AM  Page 57

Red Wizards of Thay

Red Wizard. In situations where a Red Wizard is accused of a

crime, the local autharch usually defers to his or her tharchion

to avoid the possibly fatal blunder of confronting a Red Wizard

who is under the protection of a higher-level politician.

While this chain of command works in theory, in practice

the  zulkirs  hand  down  orders  to  the  tharchions,  autharchs,

military,  khazarks,  or  commoners  with  impunity.  The  only

people  with  any  real  independence  are  wizards,  who  endure

long apprenticeships to their cruel masters before being able

to strike out on their own and possibly enter the ranks of the

Red Wizards.

The Zulkirs

See the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting for basic infor-

mation on the zulkirs. The following section includes notes on

the zulkirs relationships with the enclaves and other signifi-

cant observations.

Aznar Thrul, the zulkir of Evocation, enjoys using his mas-

tery of elements archmage ability to surprise foes with vari-

ants  of  spells  using  different  energies.  He  has  little  involve-

ment in the enclaves because they rarely sell items with powers

from his specialized school. Instead, he has ordered his under-

lings to prepare powerful magic items of the Evocation school

(such as wands of fireball) in anticipation of a great demand

in black market items through the enclaves.

Druxus Rhym, the zulkir of Transmutation, maintains an

alliance with Szass Tam. His enthusiasm helped persuade Tam

to consider the enclaves as a viable option. Druxus was one of

the earliest supporters of the enclaves and invested much of

his personal fortune in the first three, which has been repaid

fivefold. He is not averse to assassinating his political enemies,

and one of his favorite methods is transforming his enemies

equipment  or  food  into  poisonous  vermin.  One  of  his  arch-

mage powers is the teleport spell-like ability.

Lallara, the zulkir of Abjuration, is an enthusiastic supporter

of the enclaves, since abjurative items are common commodi-

ties there. She is the sole sponsor of the enclave in Procampur,

which brings her a great return in both money and slaves. She

rewards  enclave  abjurers  who  send  her  information,  and  the

khazark  of  the  Procampur  enclave  is  one  of  her  favored

former  apprentices  and  staunchest  supporters.  She  has  the

mastery of counterspelling archmage ability, which she has put

to good use defeating rivals.

Lauzoril, the zulkir of Enchantment, is indifferent to the

concept of enclaves, because they rarely sell his sort of magic.

He has yet to sponsor an enclave and is considering sabotage

and  rumors  to  hamper  the  efficiency  of  the  enclaves  just  to

avoid any one faction from gaining too much power. He is fond

of creating intelligent magic weapons loyal to him that sow dis-

cord  among  his  enemies.  He  remains  steadfastly  opposed  to

Szass  Tam  and  is  looking  for  some  magical  means  to  wrest

away control of the lichs undead armies.

Mythrellaa, the zulkir of Illusion, has refused any involve-

ment with the enclaves, although she has spies and informants

in several large ones on the coast of the Inner Sea. She has the

Greater Spell Penetration feat, making her illusions very diffi-

cult  to  disbelieve.  Like  Lallara,  she  pays  close  attention  to

what her agents in the enclaves have to say. After a falling-out

with Szass Tam, she retreated to her tower and has professed

neutrality in all dealings with the other zulkirs.

Nevron, the  zulkir  of  Conjuration,  has  no  interest  in  the

success of the enclaves and has been focusing his attention on

creating  scrolls  of  demon-summoning  spells.  He  is  known  to

own a ring of wizardry and a robe of the archmagi, and many

suspect he has demonic allies. Nevron opposes Szass Tam and is

casually allied with Lauzoril, although he would betray the en-

chanter instantly if doing so would advance his own power.

Szass Tam, the feared zulkir of Necromancy, is hesitant to

openly  support  the  enclaves,  but  he  is  not  working  against

them.  He  sponsors  (through  intermediaries)  one  enclave  to

Appearance and Personality

The following are typical personalities and attitudes for Red

Wizards  of  the  various  schools  of  specialization  and  those

who typically travel with them. These descriptions assume a

person of evil alignment.

Red  Wizard,  Abjuration: Distant  and  perceptive,  with  a

scrutinizing eye and a habit of looking over one shoulder.

Red Wizard, Conjuration: Arrogant and controlling, with

a  habit  of  giving  orders  and  expecting  no  delay  in  compli-

ance.

Red  Wizard,  Necromancy: Brooding  and  gloomy,  with

little interest in the welfare of companions or servants.

Red  Wizard,  Transmutation: Analytical  and  obsessive,

with prepared responses for most any situation or conversa-

tion.

Cleric  of  Bane: Stern  and  inflammatory,  with  loyalty

toward a strong leader and derision toward a weak one (espe-

cially toward the leader of an opposing group).

Cleric  of  Kossuth: Aggressive  and  proselytizing,  greedy

Red  Wizard,  Divination: Wise  and  alert,  accustomed  to

about goods and power.

knowing the thoughts and secrets of those around them.

Red Wizard, Evocation: Hotheaded and reactionary, with

a  tendency  to  argue  and  solve  problems  by  using  excessive

force.

Cleric of Loviatar: Cruel and malicious, with a cold air and

a habit of inflicting needless mental and physical pain.

Cleric of Shar: Angry and remote, with a stare that implies

every tiny insult will not be forgotten.

Red Wizard, Enchantment: Personable and condescending,

Thayan Knight: Stern and intimidating, paranoid and pro-

with a slight undercurrent of slimy untrustworthiness.

tectively lurking around nearby Red Wizards.

Red Wizard, Illusion: Flamboyant and mysterious, with a

Fighter Bodyguard: Sullen and compliant, with an air of

tendency for careless use of charged magic items.

fatalism and despair.

Red Wizards of Thay

monitor  how  it  functions  and  to  keep  the  balance  of  power

from  shifting  away  from  him.  Like  Aznar  Thrul,  he  antici-

pates a demand for more dangerous items and has set plans in

action to stockpile items of this nature. Szass Tam has created

hundreds of magic items during his lifetime, many of which

are intentionally cursed so the wielder is eventually compelled

to serve him. These are likely to make their way into the hands

of greedy buyers in the near future.

Yaphyll, the zulkir of Divination, is an ally of Lallara and

one of the few people who can focus the abjurers attention on

important topics at critical times. She avoids danger by know-

ing about any plots against her before they come to fruition.

She wears a magic amulet that protects her from penalties for

aging and makes her appear to be thirty years of age. She has

spies in every enclave, often giving the weaker ones strong pro-

tective items to ensure both their survival and their loyalty.

The Tharchions

The  tharchions  directly  control  the  territories  of  Thay  as

noted below.

Azhir  Kren (NE  female  human  Ftr15)  is  the  aggressive

tharchion  of  Gauros.  She  controls  a  strong  army  backed  by

Szass Tams legion of zombies. Her hatred of Rashemen may

eventually lead her to cross the border with her forces, forcing

the zulkirs to stop her.

Aznar Thrul is the tharchion of Priador as well as the zulkir

of Evocation, as noted above.

Dimon (LN  male  human  Clr5  of  Waukeen)  oversees  the

tharch of Tyraturos. Disillusioned with his faith, he retains his

talents in finance and manipulation, which makes his tharch

very profitable.

Dmitra Flass (LE female human Ill13) is the tharchion of

Eltabbar. Beautiful, bald, and elaborately adorned with magic

tattoos,  she  is  known  as  the  First  Princess  of  Thay  in  other

lands. She is married to the High Blade of Mulmaster, Selfaril

Uoumdolphin. She is closely allied with Szass Tam and has an

extensive spy network.

Hezass Nymar (NE male human Clr8 of Kossuth) rules the

tharch of Lapendrar. Weak-willed and corrupt, he does what-

ever the zulkirs tell him. Those within his church believe that

the Firelord will soon come to cleanse Nymar of his weakness,

and his fellow clerics debate whether he will survive the cleans-

ing. If he were removed from office, the church would push to

have another cleric of Kossuth take his place.

Invarri Metron (LE male human Ftr11) is the tharchion of

Delhumide. While this region used to be the capital of the Mul-

horandi province of Thay, Invarri has little interest in picking

over the ruins for treasure and instead has been working to in-

crease his tharchs farming output and strengthen its defenses

against possible attacks by Rashemen.

Milsantos  Daramos (LN  male  human  F14)  controls  the

tharch of Thazalhar. An aged patriot, he is pleased that Thay

is finally being productive in the absence of ill-planned and dis-

astrous wars, and he looks forward to Thay remaining prosper-

ous until the day he dies.

Homen Odesseiron (LE male human Evo6/Red1/Ftr12) is

the tharchion of Surthay and a former Red Wizard, having

voluntarily  removed  himself  from  the  ranks  of  his  arcane

peers to focus on the military might of his tharch. He used to

lead raids against Rashemen and maintains a sizable army.

Nymia Focar (CE female human Ftr9) is the tharchion of

Pyarados. Because her tharch is a haven for those seeking glory

and loot in the eastern mountains, she overcharges adventur-

ers  for  equipment  and  taxes  the  mines  there,  resulting  in  a

very wealthy province.

Pyras Autorian (LE male human Ari2) is the young tharchion

of Thaymount. Chosen by Szass Tam, he is a civil servant of min-

imal skill and little more than a puppet of the lich. Szass Tam

keeps him protected with bodyguards, spells, and magic items.

Thessaloni Canos (LE female human Ftr17) is a skilled mil-

itary commander and sailor, and has been tharchion of Alaor

for over thirty years despite many attempts to slay or unseat

her. She prefers to remain neutral in any conflicts between the

zulkirs, and her ability to avoid offending them impresses as

often as it infuriates.

The Red Wizards

While the zulkirs and tharchions may be the most prominent

leaders of the country, the Red Wizards at all levels are seen as

the epitome of the evil of Thay. Red Wizards hold the power

of life and death over others in that land, and only other rival

Red  Wizards  keep  them  from  exerting  that  power  at  whim.

Standing laws in Thay prevent the Red Wizards from simply

seizing whatever food they want from farmers and any item

they desire from merchants. Their main power is political, and

those who regard themselves as above such mortal and mun-

dane concerns quickly find themselves exiled or killed by other

Red Wizards intent on preserving the status quo.

In practice, a Red Wizard is likely to have many contacts,

allies,  and  enemies  among  the  wizards  and  the  Red  Wizards,

with  servants  of  varying  types  and  various  power  levels.  If  a

Red  Wizard  is  slain  or  disappears,  his  allies  investigate.  Al-

though they most often assume that the disappearance is due to

a rival and leave it at that, occasionally the allies try to find and

destroy those responsible for the death.

The wizards of Thay grow up and are educated in a cutthroat

environment of intrigue, competition, and cruelty. They have

survived  dangerous  masters  and  evil  rivals,  and  have  experi-

enced and witnessed magic that is prohibited by more ethical

wizards. They are not fools, although some are megalomaniacs

and cannot see the flaws in their own plans. The environment

in which they are raised and trained makes them dangerous op-

ponents, and no one should take them lightly.

The Guild of Foreign Trade

Thays enclaves in foreign lands are administered through the

offices of the Guild of Foreign Trade, based in Bezantur. Fifty

years ago, the guild was a mere shell of an organization that

existed only for the purpose of selling charters to Thayan mer-

chants who wished to trade abroad. The success of the magic

item trade has made the leading officers of the Guild of For-

eign Trade some of the most powerful, wealthy, and influen-

tial people in Thay.

The  guilds  sprawling  warehouses,  buried  vaults,  and  for-

tresslike buildings cover dozens of acres and employ hundreds

of  wizards,  dozens  of  powerful  magical  guardians,  and

common guards, clerks, and laborers numbering in the thou-

sands. From the guild wharves the yellow-sailed dromonds of

Thay  travel  to  all  corners  of  the  Inner  Sea,  carrying  the

output  of  Thays  magical  workshops  under  heavy  guard.  At

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  11:07 AM  Page 59

Red Wizards of Thay

these  same  wharves,  wealth  in  the  form  of  gold,  slaves,  and

valuable trade goods returns to Thay in payment.

The Guild of Foreign Trade is administered by Samas Kul

(LE male human Tra7/Red8), a brilliant, ambitious man who

stands high in the ranks of the Red Wizards. He is second only

to the zulkir Druxus Rhym among those Red Wizards in the

school of Transmutation, mostly due to the staggering wealth

at  his  disposal.  As  the  grand  master  of  a  government-spon-

sored guild, Samas Kul is nominally an autharch, but in truth

his power and influence exceeds that of all but the strongest

tharchions.  Corpulent  and  cynical,  Samas  Kul  goes  about  his

business  draped  in  gem-studded  garments  with  rings  worth

thousands of gold pieces on each finger, flaunting the wealth

that pours into Thays coffers (and his own) through the guild.

Several of the zulkirs are counted as members of the guilds

directing board, although in practice they leave Samas Kul to

administer the operation while collecting bribes and payoffs of

staggering amounts for their forbearance and continued good

will. In theory the Guild of Foreign Trade passes on all profits

to the state, but in practice the state receives much less than

the zulkirs (or other highly placed Red Wizards) who happen

to have their hands in the till.

Many lesser Red Wizards are nominally employed in the guild,

answering to Samas Kul while they direct the revenues generated

through their work back to the zulkirs who sponsored them. The

Guild of Foreign Trade purchases items crafted by the wizards la-

boring in the zulkirs workshops and laboratories for sale abroad,

and a number of Red Wizards are involved in commandeering the

necessary resources to keep up the flow of goods. Other Red Wiz-

ards serve in the enclaves as administrators, spies, and guardians,

as well as crafters of magical goods at each location. The guild at-

tracts a significant number of the best and brightest low-ranking

Red Wizards, who scheme for an opportunity to become a master

or grand master of the guild and reach the elite ranks of those

who can divert its profits to their own pockets with impunity.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The zulkirs eventual goal is to rule the world. For centuries

they tried to attain this goal with force of arms; now they are

trying to do it with trade. Whether or not the enclave system

allows them to slowly take over Faern, it provides them an

incredible amount of resources for their other projects, which

include raising armies, funding spell research, and paying spies

and assassins in foreign countries.

The goal of the Thayan enclaves is to acquire information

and wealth, which are funneled to the homeland. Contacts are

also  important,  as  is  the  patronage  of  individuals  willing  to

make special deals for illicit goods or in exchange for favors.

The  leader  of  the  enclave  is  responsible  for  tracking  which

items  and  services  are  selling  well  or  poorly,  and  adjusting

staff to accommodate productions of in-demand items.

While some individual Red Wizards are isolationists, seek-

ing to close off their nation from others to protect their vast

magical secrets, these are in the minority. To a Red Wizard,

power  is  the  fundamental  currency,  and  magical  power  the

most widely accepted and understood kind of force. Even those

who have no intention of conquering the world wish to secure

enough power to hold their little piece of it, destroy their old

master,  defeat  a  hated  rival,  or  find  a  lost  artifact.  A  Red

Wizard who gives something away (particularly magic) usually

has  an  agenda  and  is  profiting  somehow  from  doing  so,  al-

though that profit may not be apparent to the recipient and

may not be in terms of tangible wealth.

RECRUITING

The  Red  Wizards  have  no  interest  in  non-Thayans  joining

their  ranks.  Anyone  who  isnt  Thayan  is  worthy  only  of  en-

slavement,  and  of  the  two  races  of  humans  living  in  Thay,

only the Mulan (descendants of the Mulhorandi noble class)

deserve true power. The Red Wizards have no interest in re-

cruiting  others  to  join  their  ranks,  particularly  those  of  the

inferior Rashemi race native to their country.

Non-Thayans can be valuable tools and allies, however, and

the Red Wizards are always looking for people willing to work

for them, whether as spies, scouts, fences, smugglers, slavers, or

on other tasks that they find too cumbersome or with which

they dont want to be directly associated. Such individuals can

be  found  in  almost  any  part  of  the  world,  particularly  near

places that have a significant enclave. These agents are often

paid in magic items or magical services.

Just as they know that slaves are valuable property and should

not be destroyed without good reason, the Red Wizards know that

their  contacts  and  servants  outside  Thay  require  some  care  and

should not be abandoned simply when circumstances turn against

them. They have a reputation to maintain as reliable merchants

and employers, and they do not deliberately send skilled agents into

circumstances where they are likely to be killed. In short, employ-

ees of the Red Wizards are not disposable, but can be sacrificed if

their deaths accomplish some greater goal (or if saving them re-

quires the expenditure of more resources than they are worth).

ALLIES

The  Red  Wizards  have  few  allies,  given  their  history  of  be-

trayal and aggression. Their allies consist of their agents, the

Thayan  branch  of  the  church  of  Kossuth,  people  who  value

their merchandise (a tenuous alliance at best), and local spell-

casters  interested  in  trading  magic.  Some  may  have  agree-

ments with powerful fiends as well. While they maintain their

roles as peaceful merchants, the Red Wizards may be able to

make alliances with certain mercantile groups such as the Iron

Throne, the Shadow Thieves, and the Rundeen. If they tread

carefully,  the  Red  Wizards  might  be  able  to  ally  themselves

with  more  aggressive  groups  such  as  the  Zhentarim  and  the

Cult of the Dragon, taking a secondary role in their plans but

able to quickly gain power when they feel the time is right.

A  Thayan  wizard  almost  always  has  a  familiar,  for  while

such a creature does make the wizard vulnerable to someone

who could capture it, it gives him an extra set of eyes and ears

with which to spy upon his enemy or be alert for attackers.

The greatest ally of a traveling group of Red Wizards is the

presence of an enclave. An enclave can function as a tempo-

rary  base  of  operations,  a  safe  house,  and  a  place  to  acquire

magic items in an emergency. Within an enclave, the Red Wiz-

ards  are  politically  on  their  home  soil.  Standing  on  safer

ground and bolstered by the presence of their fellow Thayans,

they are not likely to suffer abuse at the hands of foreigners.

From within an enclave, a Red Wizard can find lodging and

even arrange to be disguised or teleported to another location.

A group of Red Wizards traveling in a hurry toward a nearby

city is probably seeking a temporary refuge.

Red Wizards of Thay

ENEMIES

While the Guild of Foreign Trade may wear a peaceful face,

the Red Wizards are still devoted to evil goals as a whole, and

so they are opposed by organizations that fight evil in Faern.

Primary  enemies  of  this  type  are  the  Harpers,  who  rarely

oppose them overtly, seeking instead to thwart and reveal evil

deeds  the  Red  Wizards  commit  in  the  guise  of  peddlers  of

magic. The Harpers locate and liberate slaves on their way to

Thay and destroy caches and shipments of dangerous Thayan

magic items when they can.

The  Lords  Alliance  opposes  groups  that  seek  to  control

the  North  through  trade  or  treachery.  While  the  Alliance

doesnt oppose the Red Wizards outright, it views them with

suspicion, for any collection of wizards from a nation known

to  be  interested  in  dominating  the  world  poses  a  potential

threat to freedom in the North. The Alliance confines its ac-

tivities to spying upon Thayan enclaves and agents, reporting

any  unusual  activities  to  local  authorities  and  other  groups

such as the Harpers.

The  Zhentarim  keep  a  watchful  eye  on  any  known

Thayans within their territory, for while many Red Wizards

pay homage to Bane (the patron of the Black Network), the

Zhentarim have their own plans for conquest of Faern and

dont want any interference from the red-robed wizards. Still,

any  invasion  from  Thay  is  likely  to  target  Aglarond  and

Rashemen first, and Fzoul is sure that some accommodation

could be reached if the two groups agendas came into active

conflict.

Given their past conflicts, the people of Aglarond, Rashe-

men,  and  Mulhorand  distrust  the  Red  Wizards.  While  they

make  no  concerted  effort  to  confront  the  Red  Wizards  in

normal situations, loyalists of these nations rarely hesitate to

take advantage of an opportunity to foil a Thayan plot if it is

within their power to do so.

While their nation as a whole is feared and disliked, individ-

ual  Red  Wizards  rarely  have  personal  enemies  outside  their

own organization. As Red Wizards they may be generally mis-

trusted, but most have done nothing to offend anyone in par-

ticular.  Of  course,  some  make  reputations  for  themselves  as

slavers, murderers, thieves, and oppressors, but these individual

Red Wizards are either eliminated by adventurers or have suf-

ficient resources to hold their attackers at bay, and their repu-

tation usually sends potential victims scurrying for the hills.

Within  the  Red  Wizards,  intense  rivalries  flare.  Wizards

hate their former masters. Red Wizards distrust their former

apprentices.  Rival  apprentices  of  the  same  master  hate  each

other. Specialists of different schools feud over which path has

the most power, and the lesser wizards envy those of greater

power. These conflicts can escalate into small wars, particularly

in Thay where bodyguard armies tend to be reflections of their

masters power. In other lands, these skirmishes are loud and at-

tract a lot of attention, and those who hate the Red Wizards

often try to instigate such conflicts in the hope of wiping out

Red Wizards with minimal risk on their part.

These battles over personal conflicts are rarely allowed to

occur within an enclave or even a city containing an enclave,

because  the  khazark  has  the  authority  to  muster  all  the

Thayan wizards within the enclave and destroy those respon-

sible for the disruption, selling their personal effects within

the enclave. As confident as some of the Red Wizards may be,

none are so foolish as to invite attacks from dozens of wizards

at once.

As with the Red Wizards as a whole, good groups such as the

Harpers keep a close eye on individual members, confronting

them if they are engaged in evil or illegal activity. The Zhen-

tarim, the Lords Alliance, and other agencies suspicious of the

Red  Wizards  watch  individual  members  but  rarely  attack

unless provoked.

Red Wizards: Tips For the DM

The Red Wizards in an enclave are best left as enigmas for as

long  as  possible.  Ideally,  the  heroes  should  perceive  the

Thayans as a mysterious, somewhat sinister but potentially

valuable  resource.  While  dealing  in  cheap  magic  items  the

Thayans are generally honest and honorable, but its under-

stood  that  somewhere,  undetected,  they  are  up  to  no  good.

The heroes need to walk a fine line between anti-Thayan cru-

sading  zeal  (which  means  they  dont  gain  the  benefits  of

cheaper magic items than their enemies might) and full en-

dorsement (which might cause problems with good churches

and organizations such as the Harpers).

In many places, the enclave functions as a little piece of

Thay for the heroes to explore. A Red Wizard pursued by the

heroes might shelter within an enclave, confident in his abil-

ity to escape justiceunless the heroes are willing to brave

the enclaves formidable defenses and risk capture and slav-

ery to pursue their foe. Another Red Wizard might use the

enclave as a secure base from which to launch his plots and

schemes against the forces of good nearby, or quietly weave a

60

web  of  bribery  and  indebtedness  among  the  local  nobles

through his gifts of valuable items. Many Red Wizard en-

claves avoid such schemes and function as nothing more or

less than dealers in magic, especially in cities where good and

law rule. Others are far less scrupulous.

Outside the enclaves, independent groups of Red Wizards

are an entirely different matter. They can be allies or ene-

mies,  depending  upon  the  activities  and  attitude  of  the

heroes. A particular group of Thayans might be a frequent

ally,  teaming  up  against  a  common  foe  such  as  a  magic-

eating  monster,  or  a  recurring  enemy  who  waits  outside  a

dungeon to demand all magic items found within while the

heroes are battered and weak. These independent groups can

be established as foes in combat or as roleplaying opponents

hiding  behind  the  protection  of  an  enclave.  While  the  en-

clave must present a pretense of neutrality, individual Red

Wizards run the spectrum of evil, with only a rare few es-

chewing evil in the pursuit of magical knowledge.

Red Wizards of Thay

Encounters

A  Red  Wizard  almost  never  travels  alone.  Even  exiles  and

those  concealing  their  identities  hire  bodyguards  to  protect

them. The only time a Red Wizard might be found traveling

alone is if his escorts have all been slain.

The primary members of an encounter with Red Wizards

are of course characters with levels in the Red Wizard prestige

class. A Red Wizard outranks all other characters in the group,

including other wizards, and the one with the greatest number

of Red Wizard levels is the leader of the group.

Most  Red  Wizards  travel  with  lesser  wizards,  usually  re-

ferred to as apprentices regardless of the level of the wizard

in question. Most apprentices are 4th level or lower and are

oath-bound (and sometimes under a geas) to serve their Red

Wizard master.

A Red Wizard party is usually accompanied by a cleric of

Kossuth,  who  nominally  reports  to  the  Red  Wizard  but  is  a

paid employee rather than an oath-bound servant. Some of the

more  evil  Red  Wizards  travel  with  clerics  of  darker  deities

such as Bane, Loviatar, or Shar, but these priests are less toler-

ated in most lands, and so the cleric of Kossuth is a safer bet. A

lucky Red Wizard might travel with a cleric accompanied by

holy monks of Kossuth, although these monks tend to defend

the cleric in preference to the Red Wizard.

Bodyguards round out the remainder of the group. A typical

Thayan  bodyguard  is  a  2nd-level  fighter,  although  poorer  or

more  frugal  Red  Wizards  sometimes  make  do  with  1st-level

fighters  or  warriors.  Only  in  the  wilder  lands  or  within  the

boundaries  of  Thay  do  they  employ  evil  humanoids  such  as

orcs, gnolls, or goblins as bodyguards.

A  Red  Wizard  at  home  in  Thay  or  traveling  within  that

country is likely to have more bodyguards. Some powerful wiz-

ards have small armies at their command, rivaling the armies

of the tharchions or zulkirs. These paranoid wizards are rarely

foolish enough to use their armies to attack governmental sol-

diers, which would result in their swift elimination.

SAMPLE GROUPS

As stated in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, a typ-

ical  encounter  with  a  Red  Wizard  outside  Thay  involves  a

leader of at least 7th level, one or two wizard subordinates, a

cleric  of  Kossuth,  and  at  least  five  bodyguards  of  moderate

skill  (representing  an  EL  10  encounter,  listed  below).  Any

bodyguard  of  6th  level  or  higher  may  have  levels  in  the

Thayan knight prestige class (see below). The [Wiz] notation

stands  for  a  specialist  in  whatever  school  of  magic  the  DM

chooses for the wizard.

[Wiz]5/Red8), 1 lesser Red Wizard (LE human [Wiz]5/Red5),

2  wizards  (LE  human  [Wiz]6/Red2),  1  cleric  (LE  human

Clr10 of Kossuth), 4 bodyguards (LE human Ftr9).

COMBAT AND TACTICS

The Red Wizards dictate how their allies function in combat.

Each type of ally has an assigned role, and deviating from that

is likely to get the ally killednot necessarily out of spite (al-

though that is possible), but by being in the wrong place at the

wrong time. Experienced troops learn to obey orders explicitly,

since they have seen what happens when a squadron moves left

instead  of  right  and  ends  up  at  the  center  of  a  fireball in-

tended for the enemy.

Red  Wizards  consider  themselves  great  tacticians,  al-

though the wiser ones study battle records and listen to their

advisors,  particularly  any  Thayan  knights  in  their  employ.

They  prefer  large-scale  aggressive  magic,  such  as  confusion,

cloudkill, and  fireball.  They  are  not  above  sacrificing  their

own troops to destroy an enemy, although if it can be avoided

they will do so. (If their bodyguards bungle their orders and

ruin an excellent attack plan, such a sacrifice is more likely.)

Given  their  easy  access  to  magic  items,  they  prefer  using

scrolls  and  wands  to  their  own  spells  unless  truly  powerful

magic is needed. Some wizards (particularly abjurers) prefer

to stay on the defensive, utilizing counterspelling and shield-

ing magic. Many of these carry a wand of dispel magic just

for this purpose.

Clerics are expected to take a support role in any combat en-

counter,  enhancing  the  abilities  and  defenses  of  the  Red

Wizard and bodyguards, since their own attack magic is gener-

ally inferior to the powers available to a Red Wizard. They are

expected to have prepared several cure spells of various levels,

and  they  carry  potions  or  scrolls  with  similar  magic.  When

facing enemy spellcasters, they usually use hold person and si-

lence  spells  to  allow  the  Red  Wizard  to  cast  spells  without

being interrupted.

Thayan knights coordinate the soldiers and make sure the

Red  Wizards  orders  are  enacted  properly.  They  anticipate

what the Red Wizard needs and protect him or her against

melee attacks. A Thayan knight rarely strays from the Red

Wizards  side  unless  directed  into  the  fray.  This  aggressive

stance is favored by Thayan knights with access to the eva-

sion  ability,  and  Red  Wizards  have  been  known  to  take  ad-

vantage  of  these  skills  by  sending  them  into  close  combat

with opponents and firing on them with area spells requiring

Reflex  saving  throws.  If  suitably  prepared  or  skilled,  the

knight is likely to emerge unscathed from the midst of a pile

of enemy bodies.

Soldiers do most of the thankless work in combat. They are

trained  to  use  tactics  that  prevent  enemies  from  spreading

out,  and  they  are  particularly  adept  at  forming  lines  that

cannot be bypassed with a simple 5-foot step (in other words,

their  enemies  must  bull  rush  or  overrun  to  get  past  them).

Red Wizards of Thay

The soldiers main purpose is to keep enemies from entering

melee  range  with  their  Red  Wizard  employer.  Because  they

are likely to be punished if they fail in their duty, they some-

times take great risks to prevent this from occurringafter

all, an enemy fighter offers a quick, clean death compared to

what an angry Red Wizard might do.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The  greatest  strength  of  the  Red  Wizards  is  their  magical

power. Red Wizards (and other Thayan wizards) have access to

the best spells, the best items, and the best defenses for their

money. Anyone planning to confront a Red Wizard in a magi-

cal  combat  should  be  more  powerful  than  the  wizard  or  pre-

pared with items to compensate for the Red Wizards skill.

In  addition  to  their  magical  strength,  Red  Wizards  have

many allies (even if these allies arent truly friends of the Red

Wizard in question) and travel in groups. Unlike many of the

stranger monsters in Faern or creatures with magical abili-

ties,  clerics,  bodyguards,  and  even  other  wizards  support  the

Red Wizards, and they are as familiar with each other as any

adventuring party. These groups take advantage of terrain and

each others skills as much as possible to defeat a foe.

The greatest weakness of the Red Wizards is their reliance

on magic. If they can be forced into a dead magic area or an

antimagic field (or if attacked from such a location), most of

the Red Wizards magical might is useless, and they are forced

to  rely  on  their  bodyguards  and  their  own  minimal  combat

abilities to defend themselves. Similarly, a silence spell thwarts

much of their spellcasting ability.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Red Wizard characters tend to have more magic items than a

standard  character,  because  their  magic  gear  was  acquired  in

Thay or from an enclave at a 10% discount. These characters

also have the extra equipment granted by their preferred classes.

The  typical  magical  equipment,  feats,  ability  scores,  and

prohibited  schools  for  a  Thayan  wizard  or  Red  Wizard  are

given below. See the accompanying table (on the next page) for

SPECIAL ITEMS AND SUPERNATURAL

ABILITIES

The  Red  Wizards  have  invented  dozens  of  spells  designed  to

destroy  and  humiliate  their  opponents.  Some  of  the  more

common  ones  include  combust,  fiendform,  and  flame dagger

(all described in the appendix). As purveyors of magic items,

they also have created new weapons such as the ebon lash and

the  nightblade (described  in  the  appendix),  and  those  with

magic weapons prefer ones with the flaming ability.

In general, the Red Wizards or people in their employ use

few spell-like or supernatural abilities. Some individuals, such as

powerful Red Wizards with archmage abilities or feats such as

Innate Spell, might have such powers, but these are unique indi-

viduals who are not representative of the general membership.

Red Wizards of Thay

Notable exceptions include those who pursue strange paths

to  immortality,  such  as  lichdom.  These  beings,  most  often

necromancers, have the standard magical abilities of whatever

creature  they  become.  Many  Red  Wizards  active  in  Thayan

politics conceal their undead nature from others, knowing that

secretly being undead gives them advantages over those who

would try to kill them. These liches are better preserved than a

typical lich, and might even be masked by illusion to deflect

casual suspicion.

Thayan Knight

Prestige Class

While the Red Wizards are not opposed to blasting their oppo-

nents with deadly spells or shredding the minds of their ene-

mies  with  dark  magic,  there  are  times  when  they  need

protectors who have mastered the art of swordplay. These pro-

tectors are the Thayan knights, familiar with magic and loyal

to none but the tattooed mages.

The Thayan knights act as bodyguards and enforcers for the

Red  Wizards  and  as  an  extension  of  their  reach.  They  lead

common Thayan troops into battle and help guard the wizard

enclaves. Although they are referred to as knights, they have

no code of conduct, and the only rule that binds them is that

their  lives  are  worth  nothing  compared  to  the  safety  of  the

Red Wizards.

Almost all Thayan knights are fighters, although monks and

rangers have been known to pursue this career. Barbarians are

typically  too  reckless  to  concentrate  on  defense,  and  the  Red

Wizards consider other individuals too weak for the duties of a

Thayan knight.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Thayan knight, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Race: Human.

Region: Thay.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Intimidate  2  ranks,  Knowledge  (arcana)  2  ranks,

Knowledge (local, Thay) 2 ranks.

Social Status: No slaves.

Feats: Iron Will, Weapon Focus (longsword).

Alignment: Any nongood.

Special: Sworn allegiance to the Red Wizards of Thay.

CLASS SKILLS

The Thayan knights class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Gather Infor-

mation (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Innuendo (Wis), Intimi-

date (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge

(local,  Thay),  Profession  (Wis),  Ride  (Dex),  Spot  (Wis),  and

Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Thayan knight pres-

tige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: Thayan  knights  are

On Thayan Soil

For  any  Thayan  enclave,  the  Law  of  Sovereignty  applies:

The land on which the enclave sits is considered Thayan soil,

and Thayan law is the only law. This is more than just words

on  a  trade  agreementthe  Red  Wizards  consider  the  en-

claves land to be a part of Thay, and while they dont go out

of their way to offend their neighbors with strange Thayan

customs,  they  are  not  averse  to  punishing  lawbreakers  in

their own fashion.

A person caught stealing might be flogged, or branded, or

(rarely) put to death. The Red Wizards have harsh penalties

for those who offend or harm a Red Wizard, with beatings,

imprisonment, and enslavement all common responses. This

prevents  most  brave  or  foolhardy  adventurers  from  strut-

ting about an enclave, insulting folk and harassing the Red

Wizards.

The Thayan soldiers patrol their enclaves day and night. If

they  see  someone  likely  to  cause  trouble  approaching  or

within the enclave, the soldiers confront the person in ques-

tion. In many cases, those likely to cause trouble includes

paladins and clerics of good faiths, particularly those opposed

to the activities of the Red Wizards or Thay in general. In

these  cases,  the  soldiers  politely  ask  the  people  to  leave.  If

questioned, the soldiers respond that people like them tend to

make  the  Thayans  uncomfortablejust  as  they  might  feel

64

uncomfortable  if  they  were  wandering  about  Bezantur  in

Thay itself. The guards explain that for the sake of courtesy,

the visitors should leave, or at least find some place outside

the  enclave  to  leave  their  weapons  to  avoid  worrying  the

local  Thayans.  Their  business  is  welcome,  but  preferably

without the heightened tensions of an armed outsider.

While this talk is occurring, more guards arrive to support

their allies, and a nearby Thayan wizard or two might join

the crowd. If troublemakers refuse to leave, the soldiers offer

to escort them to the edge of the enclave or to the embassy,

where one of the senior wizards can explain the situation. If

still met with refusal, the guards may imprison the visitors

as trespassers, which usually results in an overnight stay in

the prison, a fine, and banishment from the enclave.

When your heroes visit an enclave, emphasize the differ-

ence  between  the  surrounding  town  and  the  enclave  itself.

The people look and sound different, the buildings are deco-

rated strangely, and armed guards are much more frequent.

Most people sport tattoos, and shaven heads are the norm,

even on women. The number of wizards is remarkably high,

and when one in red robes walks by, everyone on the street

goes  quiet  and  lowers  their  eyes.  The  Red  Wizards  are  in

power, and they have both the will and the right to use that

power on anyone within their domain.

proficient  with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,  with  all

types of armor, and with shields.

Horrors of Thay (Ex): Because of long exposure to the cru-

elty of her homeland, a Thayan knight gains a +2 morale bonus

on saving throws against fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on

saving throws against charm effects. At 4th level, these bonuses

increase to +4 and +2, respectively. None of these bonuses apply

against attacks from Red Wizards.

Zulkirs Favor (Su): At 1st level, a knight undergoes a long

and painful tattooing ritual. This magic tattoo, placed either

on the back or the forehead, provides a +2 resistance bonus on

Reflex  saves.  The  tattoo  also  marks  the  knight  as  someone

loyal to the Red Wizards. The knight automatically fails all

saving  throws  against  mind-affecting  spells  cast  by  a  Red

Wizard.  When  the  tattoo  is  visible,  the  knight  gains  a  +2

morale bonus on Intimidate checks as an extraordinary ability.

The tattoo does not count as using a space for a magic item,

but it does count toward the limit of magic tattoos permitted

by the create magic tattoo spell.

Zulkirs Defender (Ex): A knight of 2nd level gains a +2

morale bonus on attacks and damage against any creature that

attacks or that she has previously seen attack a Red Wizard.

Fighter Feat: At 3rd level, a Thayan knight may choose any

one  feat  (except  Weapon  Specialization)  from  the  fighter

bonus feat list in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook or any

feat  with  the  [Fighter]  descriptor  from  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Final  Stand  (Su): Once  per  day  as  a  standard  action,  a

knight  of  4th  level  or  higher  can  inspire  her  troops.  Allies

within 10 feet of the knight gain 2d10 temporary hit points.

This  ability  affects  a  number  of  creatures  equal  to  the

knights  class  level  +  Charisma  modifier  and  lasts  the  same

number of rounds.

Zulkirs Champion (Su): At 5th level, the knight receives a

large magic tattoo across her face signifying her devotion to

the protection of the Red Wizards. Once per day, the knight

can take a +2 luck bonus on a single saving throw. This bonus

can be taken after the die is rolled and after other modifiers

have been applied to the roll. When the tattoo is visible, the

knight gains a +4 morale bonus on Intimidate checks as an ex-

traordinary ability. The tattoo does not count as using a space

for a magic item, but it does count toward the limit of magic

tattoos permitted by the create magic tattoo spell.

The Proskur Enclave

These  statistics  are  for  the  Red  Wizard  enclave  within  the

Dragon Coast city of Proskur. This enclave is a typical example

of an enclave within a large city that has relatively loose laws

and  an  open  mind  about  controversial  issues  such  as  slavery

and illicit substances.

Known Enclaves

The  following  cities  have  well-established  enclaves  of  at

least  fifty  Thayans:  Athkatla,  Baldurs  Gate,  Calaunt,

Calimport, Cimbar, Hillsfar, Hlath, Hlondeth, Innarlith,

Iriaebor,  Marsember,  Messemprar,  Mulmaster,  Procam-

pur,  Ravens  Bluff,  Saerloon,  Scardale,  Scornubel,  Soore-

nar, Telflamm, Waterdeep, Westgate, and Yhaunn.

Other large cities may have a single shop staffed by a

handful of Thayan wizards or are visited at least monthly

by traveling wizards with goods to sell. Countries with a

long history of abuse and violence at the hands of the Red

Wizardssuch  as  Aglarond,  Rashemen,  and  Mulho-

randrefuse  to  allow  any  sort  of  permanent  enclave

within their cities.

Red Wizards of Thay

should your campaign be located elsewhere in the world.

If your campaign is not set near Proskur, this enclave can

be placed in another city of similar or larger size, preferably a

port city, such as Athkatla, Calimport, Marsember, Mulmas-

ter, Saerloon, Telflamm, Waterdeep, or Westgate.

Ramshan  Doon (LE  male  human  Ill6)  runs  the  arcane

gallery under Murith Garas.

Nephlas Phetoril (N female human Cjr6).

Tholan Ankh (LE female human Enc6).

Thazal Tabar (NE male human Abj5) runs the stores and

PROSKUR

Former members of the local thieves guild govern Proskur.

The city has a reputation for honesty and the leader of the

Proskur council is of good alignment. However, illicit activi-

ties in the city are tolerated as long as the council gives per-

mission,  which  generally  entails  the  councils  receiving  a

portion of the profits. Since a Thayan enclave usually proves

quite lucrative, the council was more than happy to set aside a

section of the city for the Red Wizards, and it has not been

disappointed  with  the  results.  The  councils  sanction  also

allows the Red Wizards to engage in some nefarious practices,

such as the selling of rare and magical drugs and a quiet and

small trade in slaves.

Enclave Personnel

Forty-one  wizards,  four  of  whom  are  Red  Wizards,  live  and

work  in  the  enclave.  Approximately  one  hundred  other

Thayans live in the enclave; these are mainly guards, servants,

clerks,  and  skilled  tradesfolk.  A  few  clerics  ensure  that  the

Thayans can observe the religious practices of their homeland.

Statistics for the wizards, clerics, and Thayan knights are sum-

marized  below.  Most  other  Thayans  in  the  enclave  are  com-

moners or experts of 1st8th level; their statistics are given in

the description of the area in which they work.

Most  of  the  lower-level  wizards  rotate  their  work  assign-

ments every few weeks as ordered by the khazark to broaden

their skills and prevent them from becoming too attached or

loyal to a job or an employer. Because of this policy, only per-

manent employees are named in the entries for the enclave en-

terprises.  Other  positions  are  described  as  two  3rd-level

wizards and one 2nd-level wizard, and so on.

Not  all  the  wizards  assigned  to  the  enclave  are  accounted

for in the location descriptions. The remainder are on leave,

perhaps out adventuring or serving with the Proskur military

or  city  guards  to  gain  experience  and  thus  be  able  to  make

more magic items when they return.

All  the  Red  Wizards  and  Thayan  wizards  come  from  the

Mulan race that makes up the ruling class of Thay. Most of

the others in the enclave are of the Rashemi race. These people

should not be confused with the native people of Rashemen or

the language of that land, also called Rashemi.

The Wizards

Chathin  Zurn (LE  female  human  Enc9/Red3).  Chathin

Zurn is the khazark of the enclave, the potentate vested with

the full power and authority of Thay in Proskur.

Torisk Haut (LE male human Ill9/Red1) is the spymaster

of the enclave and second in command.

Murith Garas (LN male human Abj8/Red1) is the master of

the enclaves arcane trade.

Aloth Kakanos (N male human Enc8) is frequently away on

various missions for the khazark.

Urhun Kren (NE male human Nec5/Red2) is a master of

tattoo magic.

workshops for scroll and potions.

Demtra Fahn (NE female human Enc5).

Umara Zaxim (NE female human Ill5).

Sopsek Zan (NE male human Abj4) is the secretary to the

khazark.

Other Wizards: Four 4th-level, seven 3rd-level, eight 2nd-

level, and ten 1st-level.

The Clerics

So-Kehur (LE  male  human  Clr9  of  Kossuth)  is  the  high

priest of the Temple of Kossuth.

Duma Varr (LE female human Ftr7/Chm1 of Kossuth) is a

Knight of the Fire Drake, and is responsible for the security of

the Temple of Kossuth.

Thazar-Ke (NE male human Clr5 of Kossuth) is the Keeper

of the Flame, in charge of tending the altar of Kossuth and

second in command to So-Kehur.

Murithi (LE female human Clr2 of Loviatar).

Tholara (LE female human Clr2 of Bane).

Zoha (LE female human Clr2 of Shar).

Acolytes of Kossuth: three 2nd-level and six 1st-level.

The Thayan Knights

Nular  Rhyn (LE  male  human  Ftr7/Thayan  Knight  5)

serves the khazark as bodyguard and advisor.

Savvis Daal (LE female human Ftr5/Thayan Knight 4) is

in charge of the slave pens in the underground levels beneath

the enclave.

Magnus  Varn (NE  male  human  Ftr5/Thayan  Knight  3)

serves Torisk Haut and often carries messages for the spymas-

ter to his contacts in town.

Arzel Phen (LN female human Ftr6/Thayan Knight 1).

Azar Vrask (LE male human Ftr5/Thayan Knight 1).

Guards

The  Thayans  employ  a  detachment  of  thirty-six  guards  to

defend of the enclave. The guards (War1 to War3, with scale

mail, large shield, light crossbow, and scimitar) are organized

into five six-man squads. A guard-sergeant (Ftr2 to Ftr4) leads

each squad. The guards are under the command of Lieutenant

Karvan Hur (LE male human Ftr5). Karvan Hur is subject to

the orders of any of the Red Wizards or Thayan knights, but

in practice the Red Wizards ignore the guards, and the Thayan

knights shadow the high-ranking Red Wizards as ever-watch-

ful bodyguards. In addition, the Temple of Kossuth quarters its

own small detachment of guards.

About  three-quarters  of  the  common  guards  and  all  the

leaders are Thayan. Karvan Hur hires a small number of local

mercenaries to fill out his complement of guards, but watches

these foreigners very closely.

Two  of  the  guard  squads  are  on  duty  by  day  and  two  by

night. The squad with the day off is expected to spend half the

day in weapons training and has the rest of the day free. The

guards normally stand watch as described below.

guards each at the north and south gates, two in the front hall

and two roving the compound.

Night: Two guards at the main gate, two in the front hall of

the embassy building (area 33), two walking the parapets, one

each in the towers (areas 6 and 20), on the barracks rooftop

(area  28),  and  on  the  north  hall  rooftop  (area  31),  and  two

plus the sergeant roving the compound.

LAYOUT OF THE ENCLAVE

The  titles  of  locations  in  the  enclave  give  the  name  of  the

building or area first, followed when appropriate by a paren-

thetical statement indicating the nature of the shops business.

Most of the businesses have an upper level used as a residence

by the owners and a basement level for storage.

The Outer Walls

The  Proskur  enclave  occupies  what  were  formerly  several

square blocks of a prosperous business area. Many of the build-

ings still standfor example, the Temple of Kossuth occupies

a building that was formerly a temple of Waukeen that had

fallen  out  of  use.  Others  were  torn  down  to  make  way  for

brand-new  structures,  such  as  the  embassy  building.  The

Thayans  reinforced  all  the  outward  walls,  bricked  up  any

ground-level windows facing outward, and built masonry walls

across  former  thoroughfares  to  isolate  the  Thayan  enclave

from the surrounding city.

Consequently, the Proskur enclave presents a vaguely menac-

ing and defensive face to the rest of the city. All the outer build-

ings are at least two stories high, as are the walls between them

(Climb DC 25). The Thayans encourage the growth of a green

moss  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  outward-facing  walls,  which

counts as a slippery surface for Climb checks.

The Rooftops

With the exception of the outer parapet, most of the roofs in

the  compound  are  covered  in  thick  clay  tiles  and  steeply

pitched.  The  barracks  building  (area  28),  the  guard  towers

(areas 6 and 20), and the north hall (area 31) offer easy access

to the rooftop through stairwells, but few other buildings give

access  to  the  rooftopsalthough  every  building  has  small

garret  windows  or  rooftop  vents  that  a  resourceful  burglar

might squeeze through (Escape Artist DC 30).

To prevent that sort of infiltration, Khazark Zurn has cap-

tured  two  gargoyles  and  compelled  them  to  guard  the  skies

above the compound by night. The gargoyles lair in the belfry

of the Temple of Kossuth (area 32). While Zurn ensures their

obedience through charm monster spells, she also rewards them

with  the  occasional  slave  or  prisoner.  The  gargoyles  have

orders to attack anyone flying above the compound or anyone

on a rooftop who is not a guard or a Red Wizard.

The Compound Interior

During daylight hours, the southern courtyardthat part of

the compound between the main gate and the southeast com-

plex of stores and workshopsis quite busy, thronged with cus-

tomers, local merchants delivering food and supplies, and the

idly  curious.  The  ground  is  hard-packed  dirt  that  becomes

muddy after a good rain.

Few visitors wander in the quieter courtyard north of the

67

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  1:20 PM  Page 68

Red Wizards of Thay

Standing Stone Building (area 27) and the stronghouse (areas

2226).  In  terms  of  volume  of  customers,  most  people  visit

the emporium (areas 713), since few of the common folk of

Proskur can afford to buy even the cheapest magical goods of-

fered in the stronghouse.

At night, when the shops are closed, traffic quickly dies off

inside.  All  customers  are  escorted  from  the  premises  shortly

after sundown. The Thayans move about the compound for a

couple of hours after the stores close, congregating at the re-

fectory, the taphouse, the bathhouse, or twice a tenday at the

Temple  of  Kossuth.  High-ranking  enclave  residents  are  per-

mitted to entertain guests in the enclave after hours, and local

Proskurans who venerate Kossuth (there arent many) can also

be found inside after hours. Any non-Thayan must be escorted

by his host (or an acolyte, in the case of a worshiper) or risk

ejection, at best, on the spot.

A  small  number  of  infiltrators  or  spies  might  be  able  to

move about in disguise without attracting too much attention,

but chances are high that they would eventually be challenged

the guards know almost all the enclave residents by sight.

By midnight, no one is about except for the guards and the

occasional  senior  wizard  or  cleric  involved  in  some  secretive

business  of  his  or  her  own,  and  the  guards  aggressively  chal-

lenge anyone found in the area. Would-be crusaders who fall

into  the  Thayans  hands  inside  the  enclave  are  generally

clapped into irons and shipped back to Thay for a brief, toil-

filled life as a slave.

1. The Main Gate

A small gatehouse functions as the primary entrance to the en-

clave during daylight hours. Two guards, a guard sergeant, and

a wizard (usually one of 2nd to 4th level detailed to the job for

a tenday or so) keep an eye on the people coming and going, oc-

casionally using a wand of detect magic or a wand of detect

thoughts provided to the wizard on duty to examine suspicious

characters. One or more Thayan knights often loiter nearby,

watching out for potential problems.

A sturdy portcullis protects the enclave entrance at night.

A  quick-release  lever  near  the  northern  gatehouse  door

allows the guards here to drop the portcullis into place in a

single  round.  Those  granted  admittance  after  hours  use  a

small  door  in  the  gate.  The  second  floor  of  the  gatehouse

runs over the gate and can be reached from either part of the

lower  floor.  It  contains  the  machinery  for  the  portcullis,

four  arrow  slits  looking  over  the  street  outside,  and  some

cramped storage space.

Guards at this gate issue tokens admitting folk to the com-

pound. Before doing so, they make a cursory search of anyone

seeking admittance. Heavily armed visitors are turned away, as

are  those  wearing  signs  or  symbols  of  organizations  deemed

antithetical to Thay. Beggars and potential cutpurses are also

refused  entrance.  Finally,  the  guards  keep  track  of  known

troublemakers. Residents of the enclave, and well-known local

patrons who have been issued a permanent pass, may enter by

another gate to avoid the line that occasionally forms here.

2. Secondary Gates

Besides the main gate, there are four other common entrances

to  the  enclave,  all  of  which  are  closed  and  locked  at  night

unless otherwise noted.

The south gate is open by day to any Thayan or visitor show-

ing  a  permanent  pass.  Cart  traffic  and  deliveries  often  come

through  here,  too,  provided  the  guards  recognize  the  drivers

and merchants. Two guards stand watch here during the day.

The north gate is normally shut but manned by two guards

by day. Thayans and high-ranking local dignitaries are permit-

ted entrance here, and no one else.

The east gate (between the north hall and the bathhouse) is

closed and locked almost all the time. It is rarely used.

A large door opens directly from the east warehouse (area

19)  to  the  street.  Shipments  to  and  from  Thay  sometimes

make use of this entrance.

3. Stable

The stable is set slightly apart from the rest of the enclave to

prevent the smell of horses and manure from pervading the en-

vironment. The khazark has informed the Rashemi stablemas-

ter Ralmek (N male human Com3) that if the smell from the

stables  becomes  too  great,  he  will  be  sent  back  to  Thay  as  a

slave. As a result, stable boys are required to clean up after the

horses frequently and wash each pen after its occupant leaves.

Ralmek  is  a  mid-ranking  employee  of  the  enclave  (and,

through the enclave, the Guild of Foreign Trade) whose prin-

cipal function is to make sure that high-ranking Thayans have

mounts available. He is empowered to requisition funds to buy

horses, feed, tack, and harness as necessary.

The  upper  floor  of  the  stable  is  a  large  hayloft,  which

Ralmek keeps full.

4. Mother Sivarras Kitchen

Beneath a sturdy canvas tent in the south courtyard stands the

only business in the enclave that isnt run by Thayans. Sivarra

and her husband, Bor, are native Proskurans who pay the khaz-

ark for the privilege of setting up their skewer-grills and stew-

pots on the enclave grounds. Their meals are inexpensive and

generally  good.  Sivarra  has  even  learned  several  recipes  for

Thayan soups to better cater to her customers.

The  restaurant  is  popular  among  the  guards  and  common

folk of the enclave, partly because of the price and partly be-

cause  the  owners  dont  judge  them  by  their  station  in  life.  A

person interested in hiring someone or in hearing gossip about

the people of power in the enclave would be well served to stop

by here, and the food is a bargain for the price.

5. South Warehouse

This compartmentalized two-story warehouse is a private stor-

age center used by multiple businesses. Nearly every mundane

business  in  the  enclave  uses  space  in  one  of  the  warehouses

(here or area 19). In general, the most valuable merchandise

available in the enclavethe magic goodsare stored in the

secret vault (area 26).

A large ramp leads to the upper floor of the warehouse.

6. South Tower

The south warehouse predates the Thayan enclave in Proskur,

and  it  has  been  heavily  modified  to  suit  their  needs.  This

corner  was  reinforced  with  new  walls  and  built  into  a  three-

story watchtower. From its upper floor the rooftops of areas 3

and  5  can  be  watched  easily,  as  well  as  the  walltop  parapets

nearby. Both the second and third stories have two arrow slits

Red Wizards of Thay

overlooking the street, and the third story also has slits cover-

ing  the  compound  interior.  A  single  guard  is  normally  sta-

tioned here at night.

7. The Priador Emporium (Korens Curios)

Koren (N male human Exp7) is a very old Mulan craftsman

and sculptor who specializes in wooden and ivory carvings and

knickknacks. He and his wife Chasesk (N female human Exp4)

ran a small business in Eltabbar and, eager for the opportunity

to see the world outside Thay, gave it to their son when this en-

clave opened. They live in modest quarters on the second floor

of the building, directly above the workshop.

Koren  imports  little  from  Thay,  doing  most  of  the  work

himself.  His  work  is  good,  and  he  is  particularly  fond  of

making  small  items  suitable  for  young  lovers  to  give  each

other.  He  has  carved  at  least  one  small  figurine  that  a  Red

Wizard later turned into an onyx dog. At that Red Wizards re-

quest, he carved several dozen more like it, which she imbued

with  an  inconsequential  amount  of  magic  (enough  to  make

them radiate magic but not enough to give them any abilities).

She gave these to other wizards with the intent of concealing

the uniqueness of her own figurine.

8. The Priador Emporium (Jeweler)

This  shop  belongs  to  Jandar  (N  male  human  Exp7),  a  burly

young Rashemi jeweler with a thick bushy beard. He claims to

be able to work any sort of metal into jewelry, and thus far he

has not disappointed any of his clients, who include Khazark

Chathin Zurn herself. As a favor to the silversmith, she cast

fire trap upon his strongbox and has sworn to find and destroy

anyone who robs his store.

Jandar is a bitter man because his wife Yuldra is a slave back in

Thay, being punished because she attacked a wizard who tried to

rob her familys shop. Since freeing slaves is illegal in Thay, he is

without hope, and he drinks heavily and takes memory-numbing

drugs so that he may forget his pain. If his wife was somehow res-

cued from Thay and returned to him, he would be grateful to

those responsible as long as he livedand as long as her past was

kept secret from Thayan authorities.

Jandar lives alone in the rooms on the second floor above

his store.

9. The Priador Emporium (Bezanturan Leather)

Drash the leathermaker (LN male human Exp3), a whip-thin

Mulan fellow with curly tattoos in place of his hair, runs this

shop. While most of his stock comes from Thay, he is a skilled

craftsman and takes great pride in his work. He sells all sorts

of leather goods except armor.

Drash  is  well  known  for  his  braided  leather  ropes,  finely

tooled sword scabbards, and custom book covers. Local wizards

needing leather goods for their magic items often come to him

with  specific  requests  (some  of  which  involve  the  skin  of

humans, elves, or other sentient creatures). He shares some of

his work with his sister, Kranna the bookbinder (area 11).

Drashs wife and two children live with him in the crowded

rooms above his workshop.

10. The Priador Emporium (Spices)

Famous for its Priadoran fire spice (so potent that when eaten,

it inflicts 1 point of subdual damage on a failed Fortitude save

against DC 12), this shop is a favorite of those who enjoy spicy

food.  It  also  sells  more  common  spices  such  as  cinnamon,

cloves, ginger, pepper, saffron, and salt.

The proprietor Shaumak (N male human Rgr1/Exp3) is a

Rashemi herbalist and healer. He knows exactly which of his

plants can be used to stanch wounds or aid healing, and usually

has several premade healers kits available in his store. He sells

these at a 10% discount in the same way that the wizards sell

magic items.

Shaumak is gruff and speaks Common with a thick accent.

He lives alone in the rooms above his shop.

11. The Priador Emporium (Bookbinder)

This shop is very popular with the wizards of the enclave, pro-

viding  paper  and  parchment  in  various  colors  and  qualities,

blank  books  (including  those  suitable  for  spellbooks),  and  a

binding  service  for  those  with  loose  pages.  The  proprietor,

Kranna (LN female human Exp3), is the sister of Drash (area

9)  and  looks  much  like  her  brother,  except  that  she  wears  a

narrow ponytail.

Kranna  is  a  skilled  calligrapher  and  forger,  although  she

only reveals the latter fact to those she trusts. She also sells a

small  number  of  books,  mostly  relating  to  Thay,  its  lands,

poetry, and culture, although she carries books by local authors

as  well.  Kranna  speaks  and  reads  Common,  Aglarondan,

Alzhedo, Chessentan, Chondathan, Dwarven, Elven, Halruaan,

Mulhorandi (standard and Thayan variants), Rashemi, Tuigan,

Undercommon,  and  Untheric.  She  lives  in  the  second-floor

apartments over her shop.

12. The Priador Emporium (Perfumer)

Immizel  the  Rashemi  (LN  female  human  Exp2)  runs  this

The Priador Emporium

The southeast corner of the enclave contains a collection of

seven different stores, all part of the Priador Emporiuman

import business from Thay. The consortium of Thayan mer-

chants sponsoring the emporium pays well for the privilege

of  renting  space  in  a  foreign  enclave  and  selling  Thayan

wares abroad.

The  Thayan  merchants  who  sponsor  the  Priador  Empo-

rium  cleverly  decided  to  import  into  Proskur  goods  that

would appeal not only to the locals, but also the Thayans of

70

the enclave. Most of the store proprietors are skilled crafts-

folk who can fulfill the exacting orders of the enclave wiz-

ards for exotic leatherwork, jewelry, or carvings suitable for

enchantment.  Just  as  the  members  of  the  merchant  cabal

that sponsors the emporium rent space for their shops in the

Proskur enclave, so do the store proprietors rent space in the

emporium to ply their trades and import mundane Thayan

goods  that  do  not  threaten  the  magic  item  business  of  the

Guild of Foreign Trade.

The Proskur enclave

perfumery, and it does quite a lot of business, since the Thayans

are fond of scents and oils. While some are too subtle for the

common nose to recognize, plenty of fragrances and soaps here

are  pleasing  to  less  refined  tastes.  The  store  draws  customers

from all over the city, particularly because Immizel can make

items tailored to her customers desires. One of her more un-

usual patrons is a Proskuran assassin who splashes his victims

bodies with perfume to mark his kills.

Immizel and her two nieces live in rooms above the shop.

13. The Priador Emporium (Distillery)

Thay  is  noted  for  its  exotic  liquors  and  fortified  wines.  The

partnership of Thayan merchants that operates the emporium

purchases many different vintages from vintners and distillers

in  Thay  and  ships  them  overseas  to  the  Proskur  enclave  for

sale along the Dragon Coast.

Vladislav  (LN  male  human  Exp3),  a  cantankerous  middle-

aged Rashemi man with a tendency to drink too much, runs this

business with the aid of his brothers and their families. In addi-

tion to vintages imported from Thay, Vladislav also brews sev-

eral  potent  local  concoctions.  He  is  a  fine  distiller  and  has

contacts  in  many  parts  of  the  world  that  provide  him  exotic

liquors, including an occasional bottle of Rashemen firewine. He

can duplicate almost any draught he has tasted if given suffi-

cient time, although firewine has still managed to evade him.

Vladislav does a lot of business with Thayans who miss the

liquors  of  their  homeland.  He  is  addicted  to  tekkil,  and  is

always hovering on the edge of going into debt to the apothe-

carys  shop.  When  drunk,  he  becomes  very  violent,  and  has

been known to swing a large knife at anyone who offends him.

14. Silo

This tall, narrow building stores grain. It has been magically

protected against electricity and fire (resistance 12). The silo is

legally reserved for the use of the enclave only, even if the rest

of the city is starving. A small wooden shelter built into the

base of the silo is the home of Evendusk, the druid who tends

the grounds (see area 34).

15. The Standing Stone Inn

Before the Thayans leased this district of Proskur, this entire

building was a large and fairly prosperous innthe Standing

Stone. While half of the building has been converted to per-

manent quarters for enclave personnel (see area 27), the south-

ern half retains something close to its original purpose.

The  Standing  Stone  once  derived  its  name  from  the  large

stone obelisk that is the centerpiece of the inns main room. It

was supposedly brought from the ruins in the Marsh of Tun by

the inns original founder many years ago. A Thayan of Mulan

descent named Sakeris (CN male human Sor7/Wiz2) now runs

the place. Sakeris left Thay after tiring of the evil and intrigues

of the Red Wizards. He also feared persecution for his skill as a

sorcerer. Sakeris uses the inn as a means to keep in touch with

people from his homeland and to discover people with a talent

for sorcery and liberate them from their ties to Thay.

As a skilled spellcaster of a prosperous Thayan family, Sak-

eris possessed sufficient influence to arrange a charter for his

business. He is a private Thayan citizen who owns the Stand-

ing Stone, not an employee of the enclave. Sakeris has been

known to hire adventurers to rescue Thayan sorcerers from

slavery or situations where their talents are likely to get them

killed. He suspects (rightly) that the Red Wizards have him

71

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  1:25 PM  Page 72

Red Wizards of Thay

under observation, and he is careful not to speak too poorly of them.

The common room of the Standing Stone is the only tap-

house on the enclave grounds and does a good business almost

every night. Many enclave personnel take their meals here too,

at least on occasion. The Standing Stone building is three stories

tall, and the upper two stories of the inn boast eight small, well-

kept rooms. Its primary customers are Thayan merchants, arti-

sans, and adventurers passing through Proskur, but just about

any itinerant traveler from Thay might be staying here.

Area A is the inns kitchen.

16. Loans and Trades

While enclave residents refer to this entire building (areas 16

through 20) as the east warehouse, only part of the building is

properly a warehouse. The rest of this structure was converted

into a number of small stores and the enclave kitchens when

the enclave was rebuilt to the Thayans specifications. A rogue

named Aothar (LE male human Exp3/Ftr2/Rog5) owns this

modest shop. He is a Mulan man with circles tattooed in place

of  his  hair  and  eyebrows.  Aothar  openly  carries  a  Lantanese

pistol and is proficient in its use.

Aothar issues letters of credit that can be redeemed at face

value within the enclave and can even lend coinage if the bor-

rower  offers  collateral  or  is  known  to  him.  His  business  also

functions as a pawn shop, and he is greedy enough to buy items

when  he  knows  another  shop  might  offer  more.  He  appraises

valuables for a 1 gp fee. Aothar started this shop after finding

an unusually large treasure trove as a young adventurer in Thay.

17. Four-Fingered Maps

Frikhesp  (LE  female  human  Rog4),  a  sneaky-looking  Mulan

woman with jagged tattoos on her shaven head and only four

fingers on her left hand, operates this store. She became an ad-

venturer in Thay and eventually traveled through much of the

Unapproachable East before bribing a Guild of Foreign Trade

official to obtain an independent lease in the Proskur enclave.

Frikhesp has a skilled hand and can copy maps and diagrams ex-

tremely well. Although her main business is in nautical maps

and  ones  suitable  for  display,  she  buys  dungeon  maps  from

other adventurers for 1 gp apiece and sells copies of them for 5

gp apiece. She makes no claim to their authenticity, only that

they were bought from someone who looked like an adventurer.

Some of the maps she sells are from her own brief explo-

rations into at least three of the nearby known dungeons (the

Crypt of Salt, the Dungeon of Seven Hatreds, and the Lair of

Shenegarth the Green). She sells these maps for 10 gp apiece

and  includes  notes  on  known  traps,  secret  doors,  and  good

places  to  hide  and  rest  outside.  Some  adventurers  who  have

dealt  with  her  before  suspect  that  she  has  made  a  deal  with

some  of  the  bandits  living  near  these  dungeons,  but  so  far

nothing has been proven.

18. The Refectory

Most  of  the  enclaves  guards  and  low-ranking  wizards  eat  in

this crowded dining room twice a day. (The khazark and those

whose  duties  keep  them  in  the  embassy  building  eat  in  the

dining  room  there.)  Several  long  trestle  tables  fill  the  open

hall, and smoked cheeses and meats hang from the rafters.

The refectory is run by the Master Provisioner, Baiyen

Chergova  (LN  male  human  Ftr2/Exp3),  a  mid-ranking

employee of the Guild of Foreign Trade stationed here along

with three generations of his family. Chergova is charged with

procuring  local  staples  and  overseeing  the  servants  who  pre-

pare sixty meals at a sitting. The roof of the building is a thriv-

ing  garden  where  the  Chergovas  cultivate  many  uncommon

fruits  and  vegetables.  Most  of  the  food  served  here  is  pur-

chased from Proskuran vendors.

18A.  Kitchen.  Baiyens  wife  Hama  (LN  female  human

Exp4) directly supervises the preparation of meals, orchestrat-

ing the business of the hectic kitchen with a fierce temper and

even fiercer tongue. Thayan bread and spicy stew is a typical

meal in the refectory.

18B. Pantries. Below the kitchens, several large cellars hold

a  respectable  store  of  food.  Items  most  frequently  used  (or

more perishable, and therefore to be used quickly) are stored

here. One of the cellars is a large ice room, magically chilled.

19. East Warehouse

The  only  portion  of  the  building  that  is  still  used  as  a  ware-

house, this two-story chamber holds bulky property and goods

belonging to the enclave. The enclaves magical goods are not

kept here but are instead stored in the secret vault (area 26). A

large ramp leads to the upper floor of the warehouse.

A well-hidden trapdoor (Search DC 15) provides access to

underground  areas  the  Thayans  are  concerned  with  keeping

secretthe slave pens and dungeons. Slaves can be brought up

to this warehouse, loaded into sealed wagons, and driven down

to Proskurs wharves to be carried back to Thay by sea.

20. East Tower

Like the south warehouse (areas 5 and 6), the east warehouse

has been rebuilt to support a three-story watchtower. From its

upper floor, guards watch over the rooftops of the emporium

and the bathhouse. The upper floors have arrow slits overlook-

ing  the  street  and  the  compound  interior.  A  single  guard  is

normally stationed here at night.

21. Thayan Bathhouse

This bathhouse is run by a large family of Rashemi, led by the

mother of the clan, Yuldarra (LN female human Exp2). Yul-

darra has a close relationship with Immizel the perfumer (area

12)  and  sells  her  products  here.  The  building  has  a  large

common  bath,  with  four  small  private  baths  in  individual

rooms.  Upon  request  Yuldarra  arranges  to  bring  in  personal

bath attendants from the local festhalls to work in the bath-

houses  private  rooms.  Using  the  common  bath  costs  1  cp.

Renting a private bath costs 1 sp per hour, with other services

optional and at an additional price.

Large  ovens  used  to  heat  tanks  of  water  for  the  baths

occupy half of the buildings second floor. The remainder of

the floor is living space for the owners. Yuldarra understands

that if a fire erupts in the enclave, the baths will be used to

provide water to put out the blaze.

21A. Womens Dressing Room. Female guests of the bath-

house  use  this  room  for  changing  and  short-term  storage  of

personal effects.

21B. Mens Dressing Room. Male visitors to the bathhouse

can change and store their belongings here.

21C. The Common Bath. A large communal bath occupies

most of this room. The water is kept so hot that only Thayans

long accustomed to bathing in very hot water are truly com-

fortable here. Thayans have a tradition of conducting serious

business and important discussions in the communal bathas

long as strangers arent around.

21D. Private Baths. Each of these small rooms holds little

more  than  a  large  tub,  suitable  for  two  people  (the  small

rooms) or as many as six (the larger one).

22. Stronghouse: The Arcane Gallery (Magic Items)

Any magic item that is not a potion or a scroll is sold in this

portion of the enclave. Customers can find here wands of low-

level spells, low-cost wondrous items, magic ammunition, some

of  the  less  powerful  magic  rings,  and  occasionally  a  suit  of

magic  armor  or  a  magic  weapon.  Few  items  are  displayed

openly; instead, customers in this store are escorted to one of

several richly appointed waiting rooms to inspect stock brought

to them in gleaming mahogany cases. Because even the cheapest

items  available  in  this  gallery  sell  for  several  hundred  gold

pieces, the Thayans cater to the expectations of the wealthy.

In addition to purchasing items available in the enclave, cus-

tomers  can  also  arrange  to  have  a  masterwork  weapon  made

magical as a custom order. (The Thayans rarely agree to make

items of better than +1 value, but a frequent customer might be

able to convince them to advance its power beyond that.) The

gallery buys magic items and resells them, but otherwise does

not create rings, rods, staffs, or more powerful wondrous items.

The lower an items cost, the more likely it is that the Thayans

have the device in stockexact availability is left to the DMs

discretion. If an item is not currently available, the enclave wiz-

ards  can  manufacture  almost  any  standard  item  of  2,100  gp

value or less in 1d20+10 days. Items of up to 8,500 gp value can

be custom-ordered from Thayan workshops (delivery time 2d4

months),  although  the  Thayans  undertake  work  of  this  sort

only for the most trusted and reliable customers.

Ramshan Doon (LE male human Ill6) manages the gallery

under the direction of Murith Garas. In addition to Ramshan

Doon,  the  khazark  normally  assigns  one  5th-level,  one  3rd-

level, and two 2nd-level enclave wizards to this location.

23. Stronghouse: The Black Mortar (Apothecary)

Tarithi  (LE  female  human  Wiz3/Exp1),  a  misanthropic

Mulan woman with abstract tattoos on her head and eyebrows,

runs  this  store.  She  is  a  mid-ranking  Guild  of  Foreign  Trade

agent who answers to the khazark. Tarithis store sells common

and  exotic  herbs,  including  cassil  and  nararoot.  Most  of  her

merchandise  is  simple  remedies  such  as  minor  painkillers,

smelling  salts,  cures  for  hangovers,  and  other  herbs  that

common folk might need from an apothecary. Her most prof-

itable items are the strange and sometimes dangerous drugs de-

sired  by  wealthy  clients,  including  Thayan  wizards,  young

nobles, and adventurers. She sells all drugs listed in the Drugs of

Faern section in the appendix. One 1st-level wizard assigned

here by the khazark assists Tarithi.

24. Stronghouse: Zurns Elixirs (Alchemist)

Kethin  Zurn  (LE  male  human  Wiz5/Exp3),  a  strange  older

Thayan man with many small burn scars on his face, arms, and

hands, runs this shop. One of his eyes is nearly covered by a

cataract, and he has intricate tattoos of a mustache and beard.

He is the khazarks uncle, so the enclave wizards are careful to

Thayan potion shop

73

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  3:02 PM  Page 74

Red Wizards of Thay

treat him with respect despite his eccentricity. He only speaks

to the enclave wizards who work in his shop (one 4th-level, one

2nd-level, one 1st-level) if hes giving orders, and he doesnt let

the wizards talk to his customers.

Kethin  Zurn  sells  any  alchemical  item  described  in  the

Players  Handbook, the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Set-

ting, or the appendix of this book and can manufacture more if

he runs out. He offers a 10% discount on all his goods and an

extra 5% to anyone from Thay. He is knowledgeable in herbs,

spellcraft, Thayan lore, and typical properties of magic items.

He  reads  and  speaks  Common,  Draconic,  Infernal,  Thayan

Mulhorandi, and reads Loross and Netherese.

Wizards assigned to the potions and scrolls store (see below)

can often be found here, engaged in manufacturing merchan-

dise for their store.

25. Stronghouse: Potions and Scrolls

Thazal  Tabar  (NE  male  human  Abj5)  runs  this  cluttered

store, reporting to Murith Garas. In addition to Thazal Tabar,

one  4th-level,  one  3rd-level,  one  2nd-level,  and  one  1st-level

enclave wizard staff this store and workshop. One of the wiz-

ards oversees the shop while the others work in this room or in

Kethin Zurns alchemist shop making potions and scrolls.

The  place  usually  has  at  least  one  sample  of  each  potion

available in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide (except those that

require  the  creator  to  be  higher  than  3rd  level),  and  usually

sells one to three potions a day. Junior clerics from the Temple

of Kossuth prepare cure potions for sale here, too.

Scrolls of most 1st-and 2nd-level spells are kept in stock,

and there is a 25% chance that any given spell of 3rd level

is available on a scroll. Scrolls of 4th-level spells require a

special order. Scrolls of 5th level and higher require special

ordering and must be approved by the khazark before scrib-

ing begins.

As explained in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting,

the wizards sell scrolls of 0-level spells at cost with the pur-

chase  of  an  equal  number  of  magic  items  from  the  enclave.

When a customer purchases an item from the Arcane Gallery

(area 22), he receives a number of small bronze coins equal to

the number of items purchased, each bearing the symbol of the

Red Wizards on one side and a furled scroll on the other. These

tokens may be returned to the Thayan enclave scroll shop at

The Stronghouse

Once a pair of wealthy merchants town homes, this struc-

ture (areas 22 to 26) is the center of the enclave, where

customers come to purchase magic from Thay. The mer-

chants houses were completely rebuilt when the enclave

was founded, but the high ceilings and elegant wainscoting

of the interior walls speak of wealth and powerwhile the

shuttered windows and sturdy, copper-sheathed doors hint

at mysteries better left undiscovered.

The upper floors of the building consist of secure store-

rooms for the enclaves inventory of items for sale, plus

richly  appointed  meeting  chambers  for  entertaining  the

wealthiest clients or visiting dignitaries.

any time, at which point the bearer may purchase that number

of 0-level spell scrolls at cost.

All unsold potions and scrolls are stored in the secret vault

(area 26) overnight.

25A. Tattoos. Adventurers and the enclaves wizards often

visit  this  small  shop.  Urhun  Kren  (NE  male  human

Nec5/Red2)  runs  the  tattoo  shop.  He  and  his  assistants,  one

3rd-level and one 1st-level enclave wizard, provide normal and

magic  tattoos.  (Tattoos  are  scribed  with  either  the  Tattoo

Magic feat, which Urhun Kren and his 3rd-level assistant have,

or  the  create magic tattoo spell.)  They  are  capable  of  copying

images from other sources or creating unique designs with equal

ability. A mundane tattoo about as big as a hand costs 2 to 5 sp

depending on complexity, and if the customer doesnt like the

result, the wizards use an erase spell to remove it at no charge.

About  half  of  Urhun  Krens  business  is  mundane  tattoos,

since his work is of superior quality. The remainder consists of

magic tattoos, which he prefers. Urhun is a tall, gaunt Mulan

man with long, delicate fingers and a habit of staring for min-

utes at a time without blinking. Getting a tattoo from Urhun

himself  requires  either  an  appointment  or  a  bit  of  luck  (40%

chance he is available on short notice).

26. Stronghouse: Secret Vault

Thieves  and  burglars  throughout  Proskur  dream  of  finding

their way to this room . . . and shudder in terror at the penalty

should  they  be  caught.  Murith  Garas  (LN  male  human

Abj8/Red1), the third most senior Red Wizard in the enclave,

directly  supervises  the  inventory  of  magic  items  and  the  ac-

counting of profits from the Arcane Gallery, the potions and

scrolls  store,  the  tattoo  shop,  the  alchemist,  and  the  apothe-

cary. He is assisted by the most reliable and loyal of the junior

wizards, normally one of 3rd level and one of 2nd.

The  walls  and  doors  of  this  building-within-a-building  are

lined with lead sheeting to prevent scrying, and guarded by a

number  of  potent  magic  traps  (primarily  glyphs  of  warding

cast by So-Kehur, the high priest of the Temple of Kossuth).

The exact contents of the enclaves inventory and strong-

boxes are left to the DMs discretion. The total value of the

hoard is more than 100,000 gp. The defenses of the vault are

as deadly and insidious as the Thayans can devise, and feature

at least one powerful devil brought to the enclave for this pur-

pose by a planar binding spell.

27. Standing Stone Building (Residences)

Once part of the Standing Stone Inn, this half of the three-

story building contains many small apartments for the inhabi-

tants of the enclave. A typical apartment has a bedroom and a

small sitting room that doubles as a kitchen (the iron stove is

also used as a heater). Weekly rent is 2 gp. About twenty of the

enclaves  low-level  wizards  and  skilled  professionals  (other

than those living above the emporium) are quartered here.

28. Barracks

The guards, sergeants, and captain of the enclaves soldier de-

tachment are quartered here. The stairs and doors of this build-

ing  are  wide  to  make  it  easier  for  multiple  guards  to  move

about  simultaneously.  Two  1st-level  enclave  wizards  are  as-

signed to the barracks at all times to provide magical support

if it is needed.

Red Wizards of Thay

28A.  Common  Room.  Off-duty  guards  use  this  room  for

gambling and socializing. Its usually occupied by 1d4+1 of the

eighteen guards not on watch.

28B. Captains Quarters. Karvan Hur uses this room for his

personal  quarters  and  his  office.  He  is  rarely  here,  instead

spending most of his day patrolling the enclave and checking

up on the guards on watch.

28C. Barracks Room. One of the five six-man squads com-

prising the guard force of the enclave is quartered here. The

sergeant in charge of the squad sleeps here too, keeping his sol-

diers in good order. Four rooms identical to this one make up

the second floor of the barracks building.

29. White Fire Academy

Swordmaster Varra Uuth (LE female human Ftr8), a woman

of mixed MulanRashemi heritage, trains enclave guards and

those interested in the Thayan fighting style here. Varra Uuth

knows enough about Thayan swordcraft that she can recognize

if  a  blade  was  made  in  her  homeland,  and  (if  a  masterwork

blade)  probably  knows  the  smith  who  made  it.  If  your  cam-

paign requires training for level advancement, this place is suf-

ficient for that purpose.

Varra Uuth is short and wiry, keeps her hair cropped short,

and has no tattoos. The academy consists of a small studio with

Thayan weapons lining the walls. She keeps several masterwork

weapons in a strongbox and usually trains with common blades

to  avoid  damaging  the  higher-value  weapons.  The  place  is

named for her personal weapon, a +2 keen flaming longsword.

30. Shrines

This  large  building  is  mostly  open,  with  four  broad  alcoves

lining the walls. Three of the alcoves are shrines to deities pop-

ular  in  Thay:  Bane,  Loviatar,  and  Shar.  The  fourth  is  a

common  shrine  to  the  other  deities  revered  by  the  Thayans:

Gargauth, Kelemvor, Malar, Talona, and Umberlee. The most

popular Thayan deity, Kossuth, has his own temple in the en-

clave (area 37).

The shrines are tended by Tholara, Murithi, and Zoha, three

young female Mulan clerics who have small quarters on the

upper floor. They cast spells in exchange for offerings to the

shrines. Tholara, the cleric of Bane, actively dislikes Zoha, the

cleric of Shar (and a user of the Shadow Weave), and goes to

great lengths to belittle her in front of visitors.

31. North Hall

This three-story building is home to about fifty of the enclaves

wizards,  skilled  professionals,  and  Thayan  knights.  Most  are

bunked two or three to a room, although some of the higher-

level Thayans rate their own rooms. The enclaves most senior

wizards have rooms in the embassy building.

The basement of the north hall is home to about thirty of

the enclaves servants and laborers.

32. Temple of Kossuth

The original building on this site was torn down when the area

was assigned to the enclave, and the church of Kossuth rebuilt

it with stone and volcanic rock. Now its mortared stones rise

30 feet high.

The  vaulted  main  worship  area  on  the  first  floor  of  the

temple is covered in sand, and the central part is a large stone

fire pit in which a flame is kept burning at all times. On holy

days  and  great  events,  the  flame  is  stoked  high.  Only  when

clerics must perform the firewalking ceremony upon gaining a

new level is the fire allowed to decline to nothing but burning

coals. Rooms adjoining the worship area are for acolytes (1st-

level  clerics)  and  guards.  Stairs  lead  up  to  the  second  floor

where the clerics live. The temple is protected by an unhallow

spell that is tied to an invisibility purge spell.

A longtime master of temple politics, the high priest of the

temple So-Kehur (LE male human Clr9) believes that the suc-

cess of the Guild of Foreign Trades enclaves may lead to a great

expansion  of  Kossuths  worship  across  the  Inner  Sea.  He  sup-

ports the khazark unreservedlyas long as she at least gives lip

service to Kossuths faith. The clerics provide healing and other

spellcasting in return for donations to the church, and the lesser

clerics work in the potions and scrolls store to create cure po-

tions and potions of other cleric spells.

32A. Guardroom. Six dedicated temple guards (LE human

Ftr1 to Ftr3) protect the grounds of the temple. Two are on

watch at any given time, two are resting, and the others are

off duty.

32B.  Clerics  Chambers.  Three  2nd-level  and  six  1st-level

acolytes share these five small rooms. The acolytes are busy,

helping  the  enclave  guards  watch  over  the  enclave,  assisting

makers of potions and scrolls, and observing Kossuths rites.

32C. Flame Keepers Chambers. The second-ranking priest

of the temple is Thazar-Ke (LE male human Clr5 of Kossuth),

who holds the title of Flame Keeper. Thazar-Ke is quite ambi-

tious and dreams of replacing So-Kehur.

32D.  Fire  Drakes  Chambers.  Duma  Varr  (LE  female

human Ftr7/Chm1 of Kossuth) is a Knight of the Fire Drake,

a member of a holy order of warriors devoted to the protec-

tion  of  Kossuths  temples.  She  commands  the  temple  guards

and acts as So-Kehurs personal bodyguard.

The  upper  floors  of  the  temple  contain  the  high  priests

comfortable rooms, plus a temple library and a secure sacristy

where  holy  accoutrements  and  ceremonial  garments  are

stored. Two mute servants attend So-Kehurs chambers.

The belfry stands two stories above the temple proper and is

home to a pair of gargoyles under the control of the khazark.

On occasion, So-Kehur gifts the gargoyles with the leftovers of

sacrifices to Kossuth.

33. Embassy

This building is thick with the politics and economics of run-

ning an enclave. The enclave wizards who work here develop

knowledge and skills necessary for them to advance in the cut-

throat world of the Red Wizards. They interact with impor-

tant  people  in  the  government  of  Proskur,  learn  how  to  get

their way with others, and practice nonlethal means for deal-

ing with troublesome individuals and situations.

Khazark Zurn spends much of her time in this building, cor-

responding with her superiors in Thay, handling mundane ad-

ministrative tasks, and entertaining the most important of the

local Proskurans who call on the enclave. Two guards are as-

signed  to  this  building  at  all  times,  and  the  Thayan  Knights

tend to frequent the place tooespecially when foreigners call

on the khazark.

The building is protected against cold, electricity, and fire

(resistance  12)  and  the  wood  used  to  build  it  has  been

Red Wizards of Thay

strengthened by means of the hardening spell (see Magic of

Faern) to hardness 11.

33A. Cloakroom. A servant stands in the front hall to take

the coats and hats of any prominent visitors.

33B. Servants Room. The embassy servants store cleaning

supplies, dishes, and silverware in this room.

33C.  Kitchen.  While  most  of  the  enclave  personnel  and

guards  dine  in  the  refectory  (area  18),  the  khazark  and  the

other high-ranking officers of the enclave prefer to take their

meals in the embassys dining room. The small room directly

to the north is a pantry.

33D. Dining Room. This grand chamber is dominated by a

long table of Thayan mahogany that can seat up to twenty for

official occasions. Khazark Zurn and her closest advisors and

subordinates normally dine here.

33E. Parlor. From time to time, the khazark entertains vis-

itors in this sitting room.

33F.  Administrative  Offices.  The  south  wing  of  the  em-

bassy is devoted to the enclaves offices. This chamber is a re-

ception  room,  normally  occupied  by  the  khazarks  secretary

Sopsek  Zan.  Assigned  to  the  enclave  to  assist  in  the  creation

and  sale  of  magic  items,  Sopsek  Zan  proved  to  have  an  un-

canny  talent  for  administration  and  has  managed  the  khaz-

arks appointments for months. Two clerks assist Sopsek Zan

in his work.

33G.  Murith  Garass  Office.  Murith  Garas  maintains  an

office here, but he spends most of his time over in the strong-

house tending to his duties.

33H.  Torisk  Hauts  Office.  Torisk  Haut  is  the  second  in

command of the enclave and Khazark Zurns spymaster. He su-

pervises the enclaves security precautions, keeps an eye on any

enclave residents deemed unreliable, and also works a spiderweb

of informants and sources in the city beyond the enclave walls.

33I. Khazark Zurns Office. This spacious office is the per-

sonal demesne of the Khazark. Visitation is only allowed by

appointment,  and  the  earliest  appointments  available  are

usually at least two days away. The Thayan knight Nular Rhyn

is the personal bodyguard and assistant of the khazark, and he

is rarely more than a few steps from the wizard he has sworn

to defend.

The upper floors of this building contain comfortable suites

reserved for the most important residents of the enclavethe

khazark, Torisk Haut, Murith Garas, Urhun Kren, and Nular

Rhyn. The basement holds quarters for ten servants, who look

after the embassy under the direction of a major domo named

Omal (LN male human Exp4).

Red Wizards of Thay

Born of an arranged marriage between two Thayan wizards,

she took to the study of magic at an early age and chose to ad-

vance  her  knowledge  of  spellcasting  for  several  years  as  an

adult before studying to become a Red Wizard. Extremely com-

petent, she requested to work in an enclave in a senior position

and was granted the role of khazark.

Chathin Zurn fully embraces the goal of the enclave in favor

of direct conquest of other countries. She is a skilled debater and

has argued for the creation of new enclaves to heads of cities

around the Inner Sea.

Normally she tends to speak condescendingly to others, but

she  can  be  gracious  and  kind  when  she  needs  to  be,  though

there always is an undercurrent of untrustworthiness. She is a

proven leader and very protective of those who live in her en-

clave (at least against attacks by outsiders).

Chathin  Zurn  is  infrequently  seen  outside  the  embassy  or

administration building. She tries to walk about the enclave at

least once a week, and she is immediately recognizable because

of  her  unusual  familiar.  She  knows  that  she  may  become  a

target for the enemies of her country, so she always prepares a

teleport spell in case she is attacked.

Nular  Rhyn: Male  human  Ftr7/Thayan  Knight  5;  CR  12;

Medium-size humanoid; HD 7d10+7 plus 5d10+5; hp 110; Init +5;

Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Weapon Focus

(composite  shortbow),  Weapon  Focus  (longsword),  Weapon

Specialization (longsword).

Final Stand (Su): Once per day, Nular Rhyn can inspire his

troops to a heroic effort, temporarily increasing their vitality.

Allies within 10 feet of the knight gain 2d10 temporary hit

points. This supernatural ability affects as  many as seven crea-

tures and lasts the same number of rounds.

Horrors of Thay (Ex): Nular Rhyn gains a +4 morale bonus

on saving throws against fear effects and a +2 morale bonus

on saving throws against charm effects. These bonuses do not

apply against attacks from Red Wizards.

Zulkirs Champion (Su): Once per day, Nular Rhyn can take

a +2 luck bonus on a single saving throw. This bonus can be

added after the die is rolled and after all other modifiers have

been applied to the roll. When the tattoo is visible, he gains a

+4 morale bonus on Intimidate checks (included in the above

totals) as an extraordinary ability.

Zulkirs  Defender  (Ex): Nular  Rhyn  gains  a  +2  morale

bonus on attacks and damage against any creature attacking or

he has previously seen attack a Red Wizard.

Zulkirs Favor (Su): Nular Rhyns forehead tattoo provides

a  +2  resistance  bonus  on  Reflex  saves  (included  in  the  above

totals). He automatically fails all saving throws against mind-

affecting spells cast by a Red Wizard.

Possessions: +1  flaming  longsword,  +1  masterwork  mighty

composite shortbow [+3 Str bonus], 25 +1 arrows, +2 full plate,

+1 large metal shield, cloak of resistance +2, amulet of natural

armor  +1,  2 potions  of  cure  serious  wounds,  potion  of  en-

durance,  potion  of  haste,  potion  of  protection  from  elements

(fire), 120 gp.

Nular Rhyn is a compact, muscular man with strong Mulan

features and tattoos adorning his entire face. Born the son of a

Thayan noble, he showed no talent for magic but excelled at

swordplay. Knowing the best way to power was in service to the

Red Wizards, he trained in the necessary skills and eventually

became a Thayan knight.

Nular Rhyn is completely loyal to the Red Wizards. He be-

lieves in their goals and knows when to keep his mouth shut.

Having proven his loyalty time and again, he is highly recom-

mended and is trusted by all wizards of the enclave (although

they use detect thoughts on him from time to time, just to be

sure). Direct, intimidating, and alert for threats or news, Nular

Rhyn is an excellent bodyguard.

Nular Rhyn takes his duties seriously and is willing to kill or

die to prevent the death of a Red Wizard. (He is not likely to

risk his life in defense of an apprentice wizard, but such an act

is not out of the question.)

34. Park

With a statue of an attractive Mulan man in the center, this

area  is  striking  in  its  beauty,  with  small  trees,  an  elaborate

hedge, and lush grass. Many couples (from the enclave or from

the city) come here to walk in the early evening before the en-

clave  closes.  The  garden  is  tended  by  Evendusk  (NE  male

human Drd5 of Malar), a Mulan druid who chose an influen-

tial Red Wizard as the target for a hunt. Evendusk was cap-

tured, driven half mad by his targets spells, and then sold to

the khazark of this enclave. He was placed under a geas that

prevents him from harming himself or others and forces him

to tend to this park. Evendusk almost never comes out during

the day, when he is usually sleeping in a simple wooden shelter

built into the base of the silo (area 14). He has no equipment,

and he dresses in rags.

The Underground Levels

Below  the  enclave  lie  several  levels  of  dungeons,  storage

rooms, and slave pens. The Proskur enclave does not hesitate to

deal in slaves, but the Thayans conduct the business discreetly,

keeping the unfortunate souls out of sight of the local citizens.

Conditions are cramped and not very humane, with prisoners

paired up in 5-foot-square cells and often shackled to the walls.

Three special cells, reinforced with iron walls and an iron door,

have been outfitted for spellcasters.

The  Thayans  rarely  have  more  than  twenty  slaves  on

hand in the enclave, preferring to ship newly acquired slaves

to  Thay  as  quickly  as  possible.  A  Thayan  knight  named

Savvis  Daal  commands  the  underlevels,  watching  over  a

dozen brutal guards and monstrous denizens of the deep cel-

lars. When necessary, she can call on the enclaves wizards or

clerics  for  assistance  in  dealing  with  recalcitrant  prisoners,

large shipments of slaves, or visitors sticking their noses in

Thayan business.

The Shades

The Shades

Leevoth glanced to his left, where the orc slaves were hard at

work digging through the rubble covering the old alchemists

seminary. He was thankful once again for the presence of the

shadow  canopy.  Without  its  protection,  he  and  the  other

Shadovars assigned to the dig would suffer the full effects of

exposure to sunlight. It was always night within the confines

of the barrier.

Are  you  certain,  Arcanist  Giraldus?  he  asked,  scanning

the wizards face for any sign of guile. While he didnt think

that Giraldus would commit a lethal betrayal in this forsaken

wilderness, so far from the safety of their flying city, he could

not be sure. It would be simple enough to send Leevoth and his

troops out to confront an army of trolls, or into a deadly ambush.

But the mission leaders face was as unreadable as ever, and

Leevoth had to settle for the expected response.

But of course, Captain Leevoth. Our spells do not lie. There

are  six  intruders,  each  roughly  the  size  of  an  adult  human,

camped less than a mile to the east.

Leevoth nodded, his sword hand straying unconsciously to the

pommel of his greatsword Ironfang. The presence of unknown

persons this close to the excavation could be a coincidence. Trav-

elers in the Fallen Lands were not unprecedented. They were

most  likely  hunters,  or  perhaps  adventurers,  and  they  were

probably  ignorant  of  their  peril.  But  then  again,  perhaps  not.

They  could  just  as  easily  be  spies,  sent  by  some  overly  curious

noble or city council. Certainly there was no shortage of such in-

terlopers who were determined to make nuisances of themselves.

No,  he  decided,  he  could  not  afford  to  take  the  chance.  The

Princes of Shade had entrusted him with the protection of this

mission, and his duty was clear. Word of what the Shadovars

were doing hereand what they had discoveredcould not be

allowed to reach the civilized lands. Not yet.

Very well, Leevoth said to his compatriot. A detachment

will leave the compound to dispatch the intruders, three hours

after it is fully dark. He did not want his troops to be at any-

thing less than their full strength, since there was no way to de-

termine  how  dangerous  these  travelers  might  prove.  I  shall

lead the detachment myself.

Giraldus  bowed  his  head  in  acknowledgment,  but  Leevoth

did not fail to note the ghost of a smile that played about the ar-

canists lips.

The shades are here, and they mean business. Their appearance

has greatly troubled the councils of the wise and learned, and

hardly a city in Faern does not hear rumors about these mys-

terious  strangers.  Who  are  these  enigmatic  beings?  They  are

nothing less than a piece of living history, torn from Faerns

half-forgotten  past.  Their  ancestors  and  their  flying  city  de-

parted Faern over 1,700 years ago just as their homeland, the

Empire of Netheril, was annihilated by a cataclysmic tragedy

born of a desperate attempt to save the empire from the rav-

ages of its greatest enemy. The most advanced arcane nation of

its time, Netheril boasted magical knowledge not seen on Toril

since its destructionuntil now.

The city escaped the destruction thanks to great magic that

shifted  the  city  and  all  its  people  into  the  Plane  of  Shadow.

Safe  from  the  disaster,  the  refugees  (who  call  themselves

Shadovars)  .maintained  their  culture  and  society  throughout

the centuries that followed. Free to practice their arcane spells

and  experiment  with  the  stuff  of  shadow,  the  citys  noble

rulers  became  suffused  with  the  dark  energy  of  their  new

home.  Already  wizards  and  sorcerers  of  considerable  ability,

they  grew  ever  more  potent  as  they  mastered  the  tenebrous

substance of their new environment.

The City of Shade returned to Faern abruptly in 1372 DR,

appearing in the sky over the Dire Wood and then proceeding

directly to Anauroch, where it has remained since except for

brief forays into the neighboring lands. Basing their home high

over the Shoal of Thirst, the Shadovars lost no time in estab-

lishing the Empire of Shadows. They have made it clear that

they consider the entire expanse of the great desert to be their

rightful territory, and the disappearance of several Zhentarim

caravans from the southern portion of the wasteland is consid-

ered testimony to the Shadovar claim. Thus far, the new mas-

ters of Anauroch have not deigned to take action against the

Bedine, the nomadic peoples who inhabit the desert, consider-

ing them beneath notice. Their attitudes toward races and cul-

tures beyond Anauroch have ranged from aloof to curious, and

from  disdainful  to  aggressive.  With  an  agenda  and  goals

known only to themselves, the Shadovars represent one of the

most  intriguing  mysteriesand  greatest  dangersin  Faern

today. Many eyes are turned toward Anauroch and the strange

city  that  looms  in  its  sky,  hoping  for  some  sign  of  the

Shadovars intent, and for sufficient warning to react should

the citys return prove the prelude to a war of conquest.

Brief History

While the Shadovars make no secret about their connection

to  Faerns  past,  they  have  been  reluctant  to  reveal  the

entire  extent  of  what  they  know  about  their  ownand

The Shades: Tips for the DM

Conceal  the  extent  of  the  shades  powers  and  motivations,

obliging the player characters to discover these details over

the  course  of  several  adventures.  You  can  have  a  Shadovar

contingent or expedition pop up unexpectedly and suddenly

nearly anywhere in Faern, engaged in any one of a variety

of missions: searching for a Netherese artifact, looting an old

Netherese  outpost,  conducting  surveillance  on  a  group  or

city that Prince Hadrhune considers dangerous, discussing an

alliance of convenience with another power group, abducting

Netherese descendants, or attempting to manipulate individ-

uals. All these activities contribute to the High Princes long-

range plans, but theres no reason that the player characters

must learn this fact right away. Penetrating the veil of se-

crecy that surrounds the City of Shade and its machinations

could be the theme of an entire campaign.

Torilshistory,  except  when  doing  so  has  advanced  one  or

more  of  the  High  Princes  specific  goals.  The  Shadovars  re-

spond to direct questions about their past with replies that are

at best vague, and at worse misleading. The Shadovars prefer

that  none  realize  they  themselves  do  not  possess  all  the  an-

swers to these questions, and that one of their primary goals is

to learn as much about Netheril as possible.

WHAT THE COMMON SHADOVAR KNOW

The  City  of  Shade,  also  known  as  Shade  Enclave,  contains  a

great deal of hard information about the Netherese Empire,

but this data is accurate only up until the time preceding the

catastrophe  that  destroyed  Netheril.  During  the  citys  so-

journ  on  the  Plane  of  Shadow,  its  inhabitants  were  cut  off

from Faern. What little contact they had came by way of div-

ination spells cast by clerics of Shar. What follows is a sum-

mary of what the Shadovars do know about their past, based

on the histories available to them in their citys libraries and

record halls. This text constitutes the official and accepted ver-

sion of their history.

The history of the Netherese reaches far back into the mists

of time, beginning well over five millennia before the present

day. The little knowledge that exists in Faern today is in the

hands of a small group of learned sages and loremasters. The

official history of the Netherese relates that what would later

become a mighty empire was at first little more than a cluster

of fishing villages that hugged the banks of the Narrow Sea in

what  is  now  the  eastern  central  portion  of  Anauroch.  What

eventually became a desert was then a verdant land, with abun-

dant water and fertile soil capable of supporting vast popula-

tions of flora and fauna, including humans. The earliest roots

of the empire can be traced to the time when the folk of the

fishing villages united to stave off the attacks of marauding

humanoids.  This  coalition  remained  unified  after  it  had  de-

feated its enemies, becoming a small kingdom that grew rap-

idly under a series of expansion-minded monarchs. This young

kingdom was energetic and aggressive, but barely civilized. It

was during this period, which Shadovar history calls the First

Age,  that  the  Netherese  made  initial  contact  with  the  elves,

from whom they first learned about magic.

The Shadovars accept as truth the notion that their ances-

tors had a strong, natural affinity for arcane magic. Their his-

torical  accounts  note  that  after  their  first  contact  with  the

elves,  the  Netherese  took  to  magical  study  with  uncommon

enthusiasm  and  quickness.  Unlike  many  other  societies,  the

Netherese  soon  considered  arcane  magic  to  be  an  essential

component  of  their  lives,  and  they  made  a  concentrated

effort to master its secrets. Every citizen was tutored in basic

spellcraft after reaching the age of ascension (13 years old),

and by the age of majority (18 years old) was able to cast a

range of 0-level spells. Those who showed aptitude above the

norm were placed in special academies for the purpose of en-

hancing and increasing their magical proficiency, where they

learned to cast 1st-level and more powerful spells. The most

talented became arcanists (the Netherese term for a wizard or

sorcerer)  and  rose  to  great  heights  of  political  and  social

power.  Many  devoted  their  lives  to  continuous  magical  re-

search, seeking always to expand their societys understanding

and mastery of the Art. The arcanists soon became the second

most important and respected class of citizens, just below the

The Shades

nobility  and  surpassing  the  clergy.  The  Netherese  royalty

were the most powerful arcanists in the empire.

The true flowering of the Netherese Empire was dependent

not on the experiments of its early arcanists, however, but on

the  fortuitous  discovery  of  the  Nether  Scrolls.  Unearthed  in

the ruins of some even older and long-forgotten civilization,

the Nether Scrolls were a trove of arcane spells as well as an

advanced treatise on spellcraft, the combination of which pro-

pelled  the  fledgling  empires  magical  knowledge  forward  at

least  a  hundredfold.  As  the  arcanists  studied  these  ancient

texts, they unlocked secrets of spellcasting that had vanished

from the world untold millennia before the Netherese people

came  into  being.  As  the  arcanists  deciphered  these  secrets,

nearly every citizen of the empire reaped the benefits of their

research. In particular, the scrolls provided the key to an in-

vention that would shape the remainder of Netherils future,

catapulting  the  civilization  to  undreamed-of  summits  of

power: the mythallar.

Using the incredible arcane power provided by the mythal-

lar, the Netherese were able to construct architectural marvels

that have not been seen in Faern since the fall of their nation.

Craftsfolk and arcanists worked in concert to design and con-

struct  ever  more  breathtaking  buildings  and  civic  improve-

ments.  They  levitated  entire  buildings  and  balanced  them

permanently  atop  impossibly  tiny  surfaces,  creating  unusual

dwellings  that  delighted  the  population  and  impressed  other

races. Artists designed public sculptures on a massive scale, and

arcanists  and  laborers  made  these  dreams  a  reality,  shaping

enormous  quantities  of  precious  metals  into  beautiful  images

that floated in a lazy circuit above the city streets to be enjoyed

by all at different intervals of the day. Finally, they learned to

shear off the very summit of a mountain and suspend it upside-

down.  They  then  placed  a  mythallar  within  a  mirrored  crys-

talline  structure  designed  to  reflect  the  power  of  the  device

back onto itself in such a way that it allowed the overturned

mountaintop to float in midair. Netherils artisans, craftsfolk,

and laborers then constructed a city upon the inverted moun-

taintop, and the empire filled these structures with citizens who

henceforth lived among the clouds. At the height of Netherils

power, during what its history refers to as the Golden Age, the

empire boasted a total of thirteen flying cities.

The Netherese Empire continued to grow and thrive in the

centuries  that  followed.  As  the  arcanists  continued  to  plumb

the depths of magical investigation, always pushing the enve-

lope of their knowledge, they refined their understanding and

control  of  their  abilities.  Eventually,  they  began  to  conceive

and design spells of such might that arcane power of their mag-

nitude has not been seen in Faern since Netherils destruction

(and for very good reason). The empire used its flying cities to

explore more of the world, to locate more raw materials for its

industries, to carry out trade with other races, and to acquire

more and more territory so that its population would have all

the food and space it required. It also utilized the cities as air-

borne platforms from which it launched deadly attacks against

its  enemies,  wiping  out  enormous  numbers  of  hostile  hu-

manoids that might threaten Netherils peace and prosperity.

The Netherese Empire became, with the passing of the years,

the preeminent magical civilization of its time, and indeed per-

haps in all the history of Faern. Its achievements only made

its decay and downfall all the more tragic.

Unknown to the Netherese, their greatest enemies were not

the vast tribes of orcs, gnolls, and goblins that roamed the land,

but a foe that remained completely undetected until it was all

but  too  late.  A  renegade  arcanist,  dissatisfied  at  his  peoples

wholesale  slaughter  and  the  enslavement  of  anyone  not  born

Netherese, departed the empire with a band of like-minded fol-

lowers. Seeking a safe haven, they ventured into caves and cav-

erns,  eventually  making  contact  with  a  subterranean  race  of

creatures  that  called  themselves  the  phaerimms.  This  fateful

meeting was the beginning of the end for Netheril, though nei-

ther the disgruntled arcanist nor his associates could know the

impact they would have on their homelands future.

Befriending the human in the guise of a peaceful and con-

cerned race, the phaerimms tricked him into revealing vital in-

formation about the empire. Their dissembling was successful.

Without realizing the enormity of his mistake, the well-mean-

ing  arcanist  revealed  to  his  new  friends  some  of  the  most

closely guarded secrets of his country, including the existence

and  uses  of  the  mythallar.  What  the  young  arcanist  did  not

know was that the phaerimms possessed but one goal: the erad-

ication of all other beings in Faern. After the arcanist and his

comrades departed the phaerimms caverns, the evil creatures

used  their  newly  gained  knowledge  to  begin  planning

Netherils  destruction.  Employing  the  information  given  to

them by the young arcanist, the phaerimms raided Netherese

outposts, caravans, and outlying settlements, from which they

stole  a  considerable  amount  of  magical  knowledge  and  a

number of wondrous items. Their savage attacks left no sur-

vivors, leaving the imperial arcanists to wonder futilely who

was  behind  these  murderous  incidents.  The  phaerimms  used

their plundered knowledge to advance their own study and un-

derstanding of the Art and then turn it against their chosen

enemies.  Eventually,  they  were  able  to  capture  a  mythallar

from a caravan outpost, and then the true war began.

Using  the  mythallar  as  a  model,  the  destruction-minded

phaerimms  created  their  own  version  of  an  arcane  device  to

access the Weave directly. Even as Netheril reached the zenith

of  its  power  and  glory,  the  phaerimms  directed  terrible

lifedrain spells  at  the  empires  fertile  lands.  Their  spells

leached the very life from the land itself. The process was slow,

but the Netherese could do nothing but observe the effect

large tracts of fertile, green land became sandy, useless deserts

before  their  eyes.  Alarmed,  the  empires  foremost  arcanists

sought the cause, even as they strove to limit the damage with

their own powerful spells. By the time they discerned the intel-

ligence behind this phenomenon, vast sections of their home

had  succumbed  to  the  phaerimm  assault.  But  even  as  the

empire  prepared  to  defend  itself  against  its  newly  identified

foe, the phaerimms attacked openly.

Arcane energy exploded across the land in a magical duel of

immense  proportions,  adding  to  the  level  of  destruction  al-

ready  caused  by  the  phaerimms  life-draining  magic.  Neither

side was able to gain a distinct advantage, however, and the war

raged out of control. The phaerimms continual bombardment

of lifedrain spells increased the area of desertification, eventu-

ally  forming  the  barren  waste  of  the  Great  Desert.  The

Netherese  responded  in  kind,  employing  arsenals  of  magical

weaponry and arcane spells to rain destruction upon the phaer-

imms  and  their  underground  homes.  Both  Netherese  and

phaerimms  suffered  tremendous  losses  of  life  and  property,

The Shades

but  the  fighting  continued  unabated,  with  each  side  deter-

mined to extinguish the other.

The  Shadovars  records  grow  vague  and  contradictory  at

this  point.  Netheril  prided  itself  on  keeping  an  accurate  ac-

count of its cultural and societal progress, but the prolonged

war against the phaerimms made it difficult to conduct civic

and economic affairs in the accustomed fashion. Many records

were lost amid the destruction of buildings and entire commu-

nities. The City of Shade possesses numerous accounts of the

wars most important battles, as well as more mundane records

from that era, but there was no means of obtaining complete

information on all that was transpiring during that confusing

and  deadly  time.  The  Shadovars  themselves  do  not  actually

know for a certainty what caused the cataclysm that destroyed

Netheril.  Most  blame  the  phaerimms,  believing  that  the

enemy  contrived  to  launch  a  final,  devastating  attack  that

called  upon  some  kind  of  unknown  arcane  power.  All  the

Shadovars  really  know  for  certain  is  that  had  their  city  not

shifted into the Plane of Shadow and remained there, their an-

cestors would also have perished in the disaster.

WHAT THE ELITE SHADOVARS KNOW

The High Prince, his sons, and certain members of the citys

clergy know much more about the destruction of their home-

land than is brought out in the official history. Ironically, it

was  not  the  phaerimms  that  struck  the  final  blow  against

Netherilit was one of their own. During the citys time in

the Plane of Shadow, it was cut off from Faern and unable to

return. The clerics of Shar were able to cast divination spells

successfully, however, and their dark deity provided them with

information  that  enabled  them  to  discern  the  truth  about

what befell Netherilor, at least, the truth that Shar would

have them know. According to the clerics findings, one of the

most skilled and potent arcanists of the empire, known to his-

tory  as  Karsus,  attempted  to  end  the  war  with  one  decisive

blow.  When  the  nature  of  the  phaerimms  lifedrain  spells

became known, Karsus began work on a spell of his own that

he  believed  would  enable  him  to  save  his  people.  Without  a

doubt,  it  was  the  mightiest  arcane  magic  ever  wielded  by  a

mortal  in  the  history  of  Faern.  Karsuss  spell  would  enable

him to merge temporarily but directly with the essence of any

deity. He would, in effect, temporarily become a deity, gaining

access to divine power.

He planned to wield this divine might to destroy the phaer-

imms and end their threat forever. Though he was aware that

the spell might well cost him his life, Karsus deemed the sacri-

fice worth the risk. However, something went terribly wrong.

Karsus lost control of his spell, and the resulting arcane back-

lash nearly destroyed the Weave, wreaking havoc throughout

Faern. Karsus was killed by the unrestrained magical energy,

and the magnitude of the damage to the Weave sent Netherils

flying cities plummeting to the ground, killing all their inhab-

itants. Enclaves, outposts, and communities of all sizes across

the empire suffered similar fates, as their mythallars exploded

and their immense architectural achievements came crashing

down  atop  their  citizens.  Only  the  High  Princes  city,  safely

within the Plane of Shadow, was spared this fate.

High  Prince  Telamont  and  the  other  Shadovars  who  are

aware of these facts are content to allow their subjects to be-

lieve that the phaerimms caused their empires downfall.

WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Karsus  the  arcanist  decided  to  merge  with  Mystryl,  the

Netherese deity of magic. The result was catastrophic. When

his essence combined with Mystryls, the deity lost the ability

to maintain the Weave. The goddess sacrificed herself to save

the  Weave  before  the  damage  became  irreparable,  but  in  so

doing  she  temporarily  obstructed  the  Weave,  ending  its  con-

nection with Faern. Karsus was killed by the experience, just

as he had predicted, but he did not gain Mystryls divine power

for a period long enough to wield it successfully. The wholesale

cessation of magical energy sent arcane shockwaves through-

out Faern, since all spells and wondrous items ceased to func-

tion  abruptly.  The  survivors  of  this  catastrophe  and  their

descendants  were  responsible  for  the  rise  of  the  now-ruined

empires of Anauria, Hlondath, and Assam, but Netheril itself

was gone. Eventually, Mystryl was able to reincarnate herself

and restore the Weave to its proper state, but it was too late

for the people of Netheril. The folly of Karsus had done what

the phaerimms had been unable to do: The Netherese Empire

was no more.

The  body  of  Karsus,  made  gigantic  by  the  influx  of  divine

energy, fell to earth as he died. It shattered, leaving a silent re-

minder of his folly to future wizardsa single red stone butte at

the base of a high cliff in what is now the Dire Wood.

THE REFUGEES

A single flying city miraculously escaped the catastrophe un-

scathed, purely by happenstance. The citys ruling noble, a pow-

erful  arcanist,  had  for  some  time  been  experimenting  with

movement between Faern and the Plane of Shadow. His stud-

ies eventually enabled him to move not only himself freely be-

tween  the  two,  but  other  people  and  objects  as  well.  In  the

weeks  preceding  the  cataclysm,  the  arcanistknown  to  the

City of Shade only by his chosen sobriquet of Lord Shadow

had already contemplated the feasibility of moving an entire

flying city into the plane to which he had been traveling for

some time. He gave the order for the city to prepare itself for

the experiment mere days before Karsus cast his spell. On the

very eve of the disaster, Lord Shadow transported his entire

city,  and  all  its  inhabitants,  to  the  Plane  of  Shadow.  Once

there, he was pleased to see that his predictions were correct.

The city and its citizens suffered no immediate ill effects from

the journey. However, he was concerned and dismayed by the

discovery that, for reasons he did not yet understand, he was

unable to move the city back to Faern.

Unraveling this mystery took weeks, and when the city re-

turned to Netheril its inhabitants could only gape with horror

at what it found. For days the city journeyed across the ruins

of  Netheril,  searching  desperately  for  survivors,  to  no  avail.

Presuming this hideous revelation to be the work of the hated

phaerimms, the Netherese thirsted for revenge. Lord Shadow

realized, however, that a single flying city was no match for

the  phaerimms.  Moreover,  he  considered  it  likely  that  the

Netherese dwelling in his city might well be the last of their

race. He concluded that he could not afford to risk losing his

city and subjects as well. Vowing that one day the city would

return to Faern to reestablish the ruined empire, the arcanist

transferred  his  city  back  into  the  Plane  of  Shadow,  where,

through unforseen circumstances, it remained far longer than

he had originally planned.

The Shades

The Organization

Headquarters: The City of Shade, normally located floating

above  Anauroch,  just  off  the  northeast  coast  of  the  Shadow

Sea (or, to give it its Netherese name, the Hidden Lake).

Members: Approximately  500  shades  among  the  approxi-

mately 25,000 Shadovars.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: Telamont, the High Prince of Shade.

Religion: Shar.

Alignment: NE, LE.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: The shades neither possess nor use a symbol to rep-

resent  their  city  or  society  as  a  whole.  Each  of  the  twelve

Princes of Shade and High Prince Telamont employs his or her

own individual heraldic device. These sigils were first used in

the  Netherese  Empire,  and  have  long  since  passed  out  of

common  heraldic  lore  and  experience.  A  Knowledge  (history

or nobility) check against DC 25 is required to recognize that

the  symbol  is  Netherese  in  origin,  and  a  second  Knowledge

check  (DC  30)  is  required  to  correctly  identify  the  exact

Netherese  noble  family.  See  the  hierarchy  section  for  a  de-

scription of the royal sigils.

The Shadovars have a discrete culture and civilization. They do

not constitute an organization in the generally accepted sense

of the word. But because the actual number of shades is small

(about five hundred shades dwell in the City of Shade), and be-

cause they guard their privacy and motives so zealously, they

are functionally similar to a secret society.

This section gives statistical details on the shades who dwell

in the City of Shade. The shades make up only a small percent-

age of the flying citys population. The remainder of the city

inhabitants are of two types: Normal humans who are the de-

scendants of the Netherese who entered the Plane of Shadow

over 2,000 years ago but who did not become shades, and hu-

manoid  slaves  that  the  Shadovars  have  acquired  both  in  the

Plane of Shadow and in Faern.

Appearance and

Personality

The physical traits of a shade are described in the FORGOT-

TEN REALMS Campaign  Setting.  Shadovars  who  are  not

shades are identical to their outsider masters, but lack the

distinctive gray cast to their skin.

The  Shadovars  dress  in  clothing  that  seems  (to  other

residents  of  Faern)  outdated  to  the  point  of  antiquity;

their courtly attire may appear outlandish and alien. They

favor dark colors such as black, burgundy, charcoal gray,

dark  green,  and  midnight  blue.  Members  of  the  upper

class wear a great deal of jewelry; gems and jewels are also

often cunningly woven into their ensembles. They are also

fond  of  gilt,  gold  thread,  and  cloth-of-gold  accents.

Common folk wear simpler garb as befits their trade, and

slaves are permitted only serviceable, unadorned clothing

that is only marginally better than simple homespun.

HIERARCHY

The Shadovars dwell in what is best described as a mobile city-

state  ruled  by  a  government  that  combines  features  of  a

monarchy, meritocracy, and magocracy. The city is ruled by its

High  Prince,  Telamont,  a  powerful  arcanist  and  shade.  His

power and authority are absolute. All Shadovars live and die by

his command. Telamont has been the High Prince of Shade for

as long as anyone living in the city can recall. Only his sons

and trusted associates know that he is as old as the city itself

and has ruled since it was first built at his direction.

Serving the High Prince as extensions of his authority are

his  twelve  sons,  the  Princes  of  Shade.  Like  their  father,  the

princes are shades and arcanists. Competition among this circle

of archwizards is simultaneously fierce and regimented, much

like Shadovar society.

The High Prince

The Netherese arcanist known as High Prince Telamont Tan-

thul (NE male shade Wiz20/Acm5/Sha10) is one of the most

powerful mages now in Faern. He was known once, thousands

of years ago, as Lord Shadow. One of the few remaining citi-

zens of Netheril who survived the destruction of the empire, he

rules the Shadovars with absolute authority. When he considers

the time to be right, Telamont plans to reveal to the Shadovars

the fact that he is the Lord Shadow of legend, inspiring them

to victory.

Well over two millennia old, Telamont preserves his life by

means of powerful magic, such as wish spells. This process has

been  made  easier  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  he  is  no  longer

human, but rather an outsider. The natural life span of a shade is

many times longer than that of an ordinary human. However,

Telamont  acknowledges  reluctantly  that  as  his  outsider  body

begins to fail, stronger measures are required to keep him alive.

He has not yet decided on the best means of continuing his exis-

tence, but the Shadovars return to Faern offers a wealth of pos-

sibilities, including transformation into an undead creature.

Telamont  has  taken  great  pains  to  preserve  what  he  be-

lieved were the best elements of Netherese society and merge

them  with  the  characteristics  necessary  for  survival  on  the

hostile Plane of Shadow. The result is a society bound by for-

mality  and  regimentation,  in  which  even  the  most  mundane

aspects of daily life have some level of ritual bound up in their

execution.  In  this  fashion  order  is  maintained,  but  more  im-

portant, so is continuity of culture from century to century.

As the final arbiter of all that transpires in the City of Shade,

in many ways Telamont is the city. His subjects view him as

the living embodiment of all their customs, beliefs, and values.

And that is exactly how Telamont sees himself as well.

Those who meet the High Prince encounter someone who has

had millennia to practice keeping his true thoughts and feelings

in check. Telamont is as difficult to read as he is to bluff. Even

his sons rarely know what their father is truly thinking behind

his impenetrable mask of glacial calm. Despite his inexpressive

exterior,  Telamonts  mind  is  always  in  motion.  At  heart  the

High Prince is an autocrat. His determination to lead his city

stems from a strong inner conviction that no other individual

could possibly be as successful at it as he considers himself to be.

Still tall and robust despite his age, the High Prince cuts an

imposing figure whether seated on his floating throne or pre-

siding over ceremonies in the streets of the city. Whenever he

The Shades

appears in public, the High Prince prefers to wear the tradi-

tional dark armor of the Netherese Imperium, with its dragon-

winged  overmantle,  stylized  vambraces,  and  flowing,  dark

purple robes.

The High Princes personal sigil is a stylized lionesque crea-

ture,  with  dragonlike  or  batlike  wings  rampant,  in  black  sil-

houette on a bloodred field.

The Princes Hand

Hadrhune (NE male shade Wiz10/Sha10), the right hand of

High Prince Telamont, is detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting. Hadrhunes current assignment is the evalu-

ation of the numerous cities and nations in the Heartlands, in

conjunction with his plan for destroying those that might rep-

resent a threat to the power of his father. His personal sigil is

a winged serpent, silver on a black field; within the serpents

coils is a gray stone tower.

The Twelve Princes of Shade

The princes are brothers, all born before the fall of Netheril.

Prince Rivalen Tanthul (NE male shade Wiz11/Clr15/Sha7

of  Shar)  is  the  City  of  Shades  high  priest  of  Shar.  If  High

Prince  Telamont  is  the  temporal  ruler  of  the  Shadovars,

Prince Rivalen is their spiritual leader. From the massive Hall

of Shadow located near the royal palace, the prince administers

Shars  clergy  and  pronounces  her  will  to  the  faithful.  The

princes divinations enabled his father to finally guide the city

back to Faern, where Shar hopes that the Shadovars tip the

balance of power in her favor in the long struggle against her

hated sister, Selne.

Rivalen  is  also  Hadrhunes  greatest  rival.  He  resents  the

favor that his father shows to Hadrhune, and is secretly work-

ing to undermine Hadrhune. He knows that he must exercise

great caution, because Hadrhunes enemies have an unpleasant

habit of disappearing.

Prince Rivalens personal sigil is the symbol of Shar; below it

is a pair of curving dark purple rams horns, outlined in black

on a dark gray field.

Prince  Clariburnus  Tanthul (LE  male  shade  Sor14/

Sha4/Ftr8/Rog3) is the youngest captain in the citys military.

Though gossip hints that his meteoric rise is due in no small

part to his high birth, those who know the prince recognize his

worth as a warrior and a tactical commander. He has not yet

expressed an opinion about how the Shadovars should conquer

the Heartlands, largely because no one has yet asked him. His

favorite weapon is a +3 glaive of wounding.

Prince Clariburnuss personal sigil is a gold star, outlined in

black on a midnight blue field.

Prince  Brennus  Tanthul (NE  male  shade  Div12/Lor8/

Sha6)  is  the  youngest  brother  among  the  princes,  and  many

would say that Telamont has a special fondness for him. Iden-

tified early as an intellectual prodigy, the boy was placed in the

hands of the citys finest tutors and educators. Although Bren-

nus displayed the royal familys expected facility with arcane

magic, his teachers noted that he showed an equally strong ap-

titude for history. At his fathers direction, Brennuss tutors fo-

cused the princes education on the rich history and lore of the

Shadovar.  Brennus  thrived  in  this  discipline,  and  today  he  is

one of the City of Shades foremost experts on its Netherese

roots. It is he who has located the remnants of Netheril still

extant in Faern and sent expeditions to these sites to recover

what treasures and knowledge remain there. The prince is con-

vinced that the arcane power hidden in the ruins of Netheril

holds the key to that plans success. When dealing with others,

Prince Brennus is very gentlemanly and formal.

Prince Brennuss personal sigil is a silver sphere, above three

mountain peaks, in a black silhouette on an ochre field.

Prince  Mattick  Tanthul  and  Prince  Vattick  Tanthul  (LE

male shade Ill16/Sha9) are twins. Black-haired and black-eyed,

they are perfect replicas of one another. (Mattick is the elder

by 2 minutes.) It is virtually impossible for anyone other than

their  parents  to  distinguish  one  from  the  other.  The  twins

have  used  their  identical  appearance  to  perpetrate  innumer-

able conspiracies and jokes, some benign and others much less

so, on the royal household since they were old enough to walk.

They are inseparable, rarely found any great distance from one

another. The princes divide their time between research at the

academy of alchemy and helping their youngest brother Bren-

nus seek out clues to the locations of old Netherese sites. They

side with Brennus and Hadrhune, whom they idolize, in sup-

porting the swift destruction of all threats to Shadovar rule.

Prince Matticks personal sigil is a pair of interlocking gold

rings, outlined in purple on a charcoal gray field.

Prince Vatticks personal sigil is a pair of interlocking silver

rings, outlined in purple on a charcoal gray field.

Prince  Yder  Tanthul (NE  male  shade  Ftr11/Sor12/Sha4/

Chm4) is the right hand of his older brother Prince Rivalen.

Respected and feared as a warrior of great prowess, he trained

first as a soldier in the Shadovar army, achieving the rank of

captain before he heard the call to Shars service. Now Yder is

a warrior dedicated to the cause of his deity. He commands the

temple guards of the Hall of Shadow and undertakes church-

sponsored  missions.  Like  his  brother  the  high  priest,  Yder

would  like  to  see  Hadrhune  fall  from  grace.  Unlike  Rivalen,

however, Yder has nothing personal against Telamonts chosen

emissary. He would simply prefer to see the will of his deity

guide the Shadovars, rather than the will of Hadrhune.

Prince Yders personal sigil is a stylized silver greatsword on

a  gray  field.  The  pommel  of  the  sword  is  a  replica  of  the

symbol of Shar (a black disk with a deep purple border).

Prince Melegaunt Tanthul (LE male shade Div16/Sha4) is

one of the youngest of the twelve brothers and does not have a

great natural aptitude in the arcane arts. (Telamont instructed

that Melegaunt be trained like the rest of the princes, despite

the fact that the arcanists who evaluate the Shadovars apti-

tudes found that the princeling had a potential that was only

barely above average. Telamont ordered this fact concealed, on

pain of death.) What Melegaunt lacks in magical talent, how-

ever, he makes up for in guile. He has a knack for deception,

combined with a talent for false empathy, that makes him a

formidable  manipulator.  There  are  few  people  outside  the

royal family he cannot win over with his potent combination

of  charm,  good  looks,  and  seeming  sincerity;  indeed,  he  has

practically made it his lifes work.

The Shades

Unlike many of his brothers, Melegaunt believes in using a

more subtle approach in taking over the Heartlands. He advo-

cates  that  his  father  should  manipulate  his  peoples  enemies.

The prince has observed that many folk who dwell in Faern,

particularly those sworn to the service of good, seem all too

ready to believe what they want to believe, and Melegaunt sees

no reason why the Shadovar should not take full advantage of

this flaw. He insists that it takes only minimal effort to put

various cities and organizations at one anothers throats, start-

ing a full-scale war that would escalate until it engulfs all the

Heartlands. All the Shadovars would then have to do is impose

their will on the weakened remnants of whatever is left when

the dust settles.

Prince  Melegaunts  personal  sigil  is  a  pair  of  crossed  red

spears on a white field.

Prince Lamorak Tanthul (NE male shade Wiz19/Sha7) was

appointed a decade ago by his father to oversee the Determin-

ists Guild. It is Lamorak and his fellow Determinists who ad-

minister the tests to each Shadovar in order to determine how

they  may  best  serve  the  City  of  Shade.  Lamorak  is  also  in

charge  of  the  closely  guarded  process  of  selecting  and  trans-

forming deserving Shadovars into shades. The princes politics

are relatively neutral, but when all is said and done he thinks

that it might be wise for the High Prince to manipulate, rather

than enter open war against, the citys enemies at this time.

Prince Lamoraks personal sigil is a white skull outlined in

black on a light gray field.

Prince  Dethud  Tanthul (LE  male  shade  Nec15/Sha8)  is

perhaps the most reserved of the twelve princes. His reputa-

tion  for  silence  is  famous  throughout  the  City  of  Shade.  He

rarely speaks directly to anyone, and when he does, it is usually

with the voice of wisdom. Among the royal family, Dethud is

the  closest  thing  to  a  peacemaker.  The  other  eleven  princes

continue to seek Dethuds advice on many of their most vexing

problems  and  private  quarrels.  Dethud  rarely  takes  sides  in

such  matters,  but  analyzes  the  situation  and  offers  incisive,

logical  solutions.  The  High  Prince  often  includes  Dethud  in

military  or  political  councils,  making  the  quiet  prince  the

second most influential of his brethren after Telamont. When

pressed for his opinion regarding the best means of achieving

his  fathers  goals  of  conquest,  Dethud  favors  Melegaunts

policy of manipulation.

Prince Dethuds personal sigil is a stylized black sunburst on

a pale yellow field.

Prince Aglarel Tanthul (NE male shade Sor10/Ftr10/Clr6/

Sha2 of Shar) took over as commander of the High Princes

personal  bodyguard  when  the  City  of  Shade  returned  to

Faern. He knows that it is only a matter of time before the

High  Prince  is  the  target  of  an  assassination  attemptbut

whether that attempt is directed by an enemy government, a

secret  organization  such  as  the  Harpers,  or  one  of  his  own

brothers,  he  doesnt  know.  He  doesnt  really  care,  either,  be-

cause Aglarel has no interest in what he sees as pointless polit-

ical  and  power  squabbles.  He  is  loyal  to  his  father  first  and

foremost and devotes every waking minute to protecting him.

Prince Aglarels personal sigil is a great helm in profile, steel

blue with black rivets, outlined in black on a dark orange field.

The Determinists

Centuries  of  survival  on  the  Plane  of  Shadow  taught  the

Shadovars  that  survival  is  accomplished  only  when  every

member of the society understands his or her role and works for

the betterment of the city as a whole. Thus, Shadovar society is

strictly hierarchical, but it is also a meritocracy. Everyone is ex-

pected to work for the security and survival of the community,

to the best of each persons capacity. This capacity is determined

by a specialized battery of tests administered to each free citizen

shortly after he or she reaches the  age of ascension (13 years

old). The tests are administered by Prince Lamoraks circle of

Determinists.  Once  the  Shadovars  aptitudes  are  known,  he  is

trained to develop them until he reaches the age of majority (18

years old), when he enters his profession full-time. Occasionally

a Shadovar exhibits such dramatic improvement in skill or apti-

tude over time that the Determinists administer a second round

of testing and sometimes alter the Shadovars original designa-

tion. These instances are rare, however, due to the sophistication

and accuracy of Prince Lamoraks assessment methods.

Typical Determinist: NE male shade Wiz8/Sha5.

The Arcanists

Below the royal family, but far above the average Shadovar in

authority  and  importance,  are  the  wizards  and  sorcerers  of

the  City  of  Shade.  Taking  their  name  from  the  ancient

Netherese term for wizard, the arcanists are the magical back-

bone of the city. They staff the institutions of learning, train

the  talented  in  the  secrets  of  the  Art,  and  support  various

missions as the twelve princes command. There are approxi-

mately  one  thousand  arcanists  living  in  the  city,  of  whom

roughly two hundred fifty are shades. The shade arcanists are

by  far  the  more  powerful  representatives  of  the  group,  and

they hold the positions of highest authority among the arcan-

ist assemblies and organizations.

Typical Arcanist: LE human Wiz4/Sha3.

Typical Senior Arcanist: LE shade Wiz8/Sha7.

The Military

Some Shadovars who demonstrate only minimal magical apti-

tude find a respected place in the citys military. Most begin as

low-ranking soldiers, but ample opportunity exists for the able

and intelligent to earn promotions into the ranks of the offi-

cers. The City of Shade suffered innumerable attacks from a

variety of hostile creatures during its long sojourn in the Plane

of Shadow, and the army bore the brunt of these offensives.

Now that the Shadovars have come back to Faern, the High

Prince has ordered that the militarys numbers and readiness

increase as swiftly as possible.

The City of Shades army currently numbers approximately

three thousand soldiers. The bulk of these numbers are human

descendents of Netheril, while about two hundred are shades

(including all the officers above the rank of lieutenant). The

High Prince is the commander of the army, but he relies on a

triumvirate of generalsShelkar, Vadebryth, and Tyrrollus

to  develop  and  implement  military  strategies  on  all  but  the

most dire of occasions. Each general commands roughly one

thousand troops, and there are many specialized squads and di-

visions within the army. Some of these groups vie with one an-

other  in  rivalries  that  range  from  mostly  friendly  (such  as

that between the First Expeditionary Division and the Royal

84

The Shades

Scouts) to dangerous (such as that between the High Princes

Personal Guard and General Shelkars Black Swords).

Typical Shadovar Soldier: LE human Ftr1/Sor1.

Typical Shadovar Lieutenant: LE human Ftr3/Sor1.

Typical Shadovar Captain: NE shade Ftr5/Sor3.

Commoners

Shadovars who show no aptitude for spells higher than 0 level or

for warfare are assigned to one of the common ranks of society.

These folk make up the bulk of the inhabitants in the City of

Shade. They know their places and understand that the citys sur-

vival  depends  not  only  on  their  ability  to  work  hard  for  its

future but also in their obedience to their societys structure. The

Shadovar commoner is loyal to his princes and devoted to his

city.  The  rare  citizen  who  displays  behavior  or  commits  acts

that may undermine the citys safety or security are discovered,

often by the nobilitys paid informants, and put to death.

Typical Commoner: LE human Com2.

Crafters

The  City  of  Shade  requires  constant  maintenance,  due  to  the

stresses  it  endures  while  moving  through  the  atmosphere.

There are hundreds of crafters in the city, each specializing in

one of a number of trades (masonry, paving, carpentry, metal-

working, leatherworking, and similar tasks). Many have man-

aged to learn one or two arcane spells (0 level) to help ease their

labors.  These  spells  are  typically  mage  hand,  mending,  open/

close, or prestigidation. All crafters are human. They and their

families  expect  reasonable  treatment  from  their  betters,  and

their wages are sufficient to allow them to live comfortably if

not luxuriously.

Typical Crafter: LE human Exp4.

Merchants

Even in the treacherous and strange Plane of Shadow, the City

of  Shade  maintained  an  economy.  Its  merchant  class  was

skilled  in  obtaining  raw  materials  and  other  goods  from  the

places  the  city  visited  in  that  dark  realm,  and  making  them

available to their fellow citizens. Prices are strictly controlled,

as is the minting and distribution of currency. Thus the econ-

omy  is  artificial,  intended  more  as  a  means  of  regulating

supply and demand than allowing anyone to earn a profit.

Typical Merchant: NE human Exp4.

Servants

Those citizens who show no aptitude for magic, religion, crafts,

or any other useful employment join the ranks of the personal

servants.  These  folk  are  assigned  primarily  to  domestic  roles

such as maid, valet, messenger, and street cleaner. While they

have  no  hope  of  bettering  their  lives,  many  hope  and  dream

that their children fare better.

Typical Servant: LE human Exp2.

Slaves

Slaves  occupy  the  lowest  rung  on  the  Shadovar  social  ladder.

Some  slaves  are  Shadovars  who  exhibit  absolutely  no  useful

skill  or  talent;  others  are  citizens  convicted  of  noncapital  of-

fenses. The majority are humanoids captured by the Shadovars

on a slaving expedition or acquired from slave traders.

The slaves of the Shadovars expect nothing better than lives

of menial labor and drudgery. How a slave is treated is left en-

tirely to the individual slave owner: Some, particularly among

the aristocratic segment of society, prefer to regard slaves as fa-

vored pets, but there is no recourse for a slave whose master de-

cides to treat him with brutality. The slaves of the city know

better than to attempt revolt or flight, however. Their masters

possess power at least several orders of magnitude higher than

that of the typical slave. Worse, the Shadovars have no reserva-

tions about simply slaying rebellious slaves out of hand and ac-

quiring more later.

Typical Slave: LE orc Com1.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

What do the shades really want? That question has been on the

minds and lips of nobles, sages, and adventurers alike ever since

the City of Shade first cast its shadow over the desert sands. The

clergy of numerous deities want to know whether they should be

preparing to wage a holy war against the shades. Monarchs in

dozens of nations and city-states eye the activities of the shades

with deep concern, and some have seriously considered whether

or not to call up their levies to bolster defenses in case the shades

choose to move against them. Meanwhile, those skilled in the

Art search for the means to deal with the shades arcane power

should the worst happen, and learned folk throughout Faern

turn to fragments of obscure and incomplete lore in an effort

to glean more information about the true nature of the shades

and their once-mighty civilization. However, for the moment

only the Shadovars know what they truly desire.

The concerns that trouble the good folk of Faern are not

misplaced.  High  Prince  Telamont  does  indeed  intend  to

embark  on  a  campaign  of  conquest,  immediately  after  the

shades  deal  with  the  phaerimms.  The  City  of  Shade  simply

cannot contain his ambitions any longer. He was born to rule,

and for millennia he has had to content himself with one tri-

fling  city.  Now  that  all  Faern  is  available  for  him  to  con-

quer, he plans to restore the old Netherese Empire under his

rule  and  extend  its  former  boundaries  to  encompass  the

Heartlands.  Each  of  his  sons  covets  at  least  one  portion  of

Faern as his own fiefdom, and the sooner the Shadovars go

to war against their inferiors, the sooner the princes receive

their just rewards.

The princes differ on how best to achieve this end, though

they  take  care  to  express  such  ideas  carefully  and  tactfully

when in their fathers presence. Some favor looting magic and

knowledge from old Netherese sites in Faern and then using

this power in a campaign of elimination directed against those

cities and even races that might pose a threat to Shadovar con-

quest. Others would prefer to ally with one or more magocra-

cies such as the Thayans in order to share arcane knowledge

and divide the responsibilities of conquest (and discarding these

allies of convenience once victory is achieved, naturally). Sev-

eral  princes  advocate  a  more  subtle  approach.  They  suggest

manipulating  other  groups  and  individuals,  sowing  dissent

among them and encouraging them to rip one another apart.

These  princes  would  like  to  see  the  cities  and  nations  of  the

Heartlands engulfed by a huge, all-out war that would enable

the Shadovars to impose order on the weakened victors.

One thing is clear to both Telamont and his ambitious prog-

eny. They cannot begin their conquests until they know more

about the current shape of the world and its inhabitants. It is

The Shades

precisely this lack of concrete information that has prevented

Telamont  from  making  a  final  decision  about  an  invasion.

Likewise, this is the reason behind the Shadovars current ex-

ploratory forays into various parts of Faern, as well and their

hunt for the remnants of their destroyed empire. The recent

release  of  the  phaerimms  from  the  sharns  ancient  prison

under the sands of Anauroch has also caused the Shadovars to

delay reaching agreement on a final strategic plan. Even the

conquest-hungry  Telamont  cannot  resist  the  opportunity  to

destroy his peoples most hated enemies.

RECRUITING

The High Prince and his sons engage in a limited form of re-

cruiting, primarily from within the citizenry born and bred in

the  City  of  Shade.  Although  it  is  well  within  their  power  to

transform any living creature into a shade, they prefer to do so

only sparingly. From their point of view, the transformation

is a great honor, not to be given lightly. They bestow it only

upon those they consider worthy to join the most elite segment

of Shadovar society. Those who, after reaching the age of ma-

jority, display unusual arcane talent, or have otherwise distin-

guished themselves through service to the city or its royalty,

are sometimes chosen to become shades. An individual marked

for the transformation does not have the option of refusing.

As for those not born Shadovar, the ruling class considers

them fit only for servitude and conquest. The only exception is

Faernian natives whom the arcanists have identified as pos-

sessing  substantial  Netherese  ancestry.  Telamont  has  author-

ized Prince Aglarel to seek out and capture those precious few

in  whose  veins  the  ancient  blood  of  Netheril  yet  flows.  The

Prince arranges for the secret abduction of these individuals,

bringing them to the City of Shade where they can be exam-

ined  and  studied  in  order  to  determine  whether  they  are

worthy for induction.

The  shades  have  no  compunctions  about  swelling  the

ranks of slaves in their city, however. To date they have cap-

tured  untold  numbers  of  gnolls,  goblins,  and  orcs  from  the

lands surrounding Anauroch. The majority of these unfortu-

nate  humanoids  toil  in  the  City  of  Shade,  performing  all

manner of menial tasks under the lash. The shades send the

remainder  of  their  slaves  to  labor  in  the  archeological  digs

and other surface enterprises.

ALLIES

The City of Shade has no formal allies, though it is not averse

to forming temporary alliances of convenience with those who

have something to offer that the Shadovars cannot or prefer

not to obtain for themselves.

ENEMIES

The High Prince and his sons consider every other race, cul-

ture,  nation,  city,  and  group  in  Faern  to  be  their  enemies.

However,  there  exists  one  race  for  which  they  feel  nothing

other  than  white-hot,  bitter  hatred:  the  phaerimms.  Long

after the City of Shade departed Faern, the phaerimms con-

tinued to terrorize the world until another primeval race, the

sharns, put a stop to their depredations. The sharns imprisoned

the  phaerimms  deep  beneath  the  sands  of  Anauroch,  where

they  have  remained  for  centuries.  But  the  return  of  the

Shadovars has coincided with the return of their most hated

foes. The phaerimms are, at long last, free to continue their

campaign of destruction.

When  the  escaped  phaerimms  threatened  the  city  of

Evereska, High Prince Telamont lost no time in lending Sha-

dovar  support  to  the  beleaguered  elf  community.  Whatever

the  rest  of  Faern  may  think  or  suspect  of  the  Shadovars,

many elves have grudgingly expressed their sincere gratitude

for this valuable aidwithout the arcane might of the City of

Shade, Evereska would almost certainly have been destroyed.

The phaerimms, thwarted in their attempt to exterminate the

elves, have been scattered as a result of the coming of the Sha-

dovar. Telamont and his sons now bend their energy toward lo-

cating and destroying the remaining phaerimms.

Exactly  how  the  phaerimms  escaped  their  prison  is  not

known, but rumors abound. Stories circulating in the lands near

Anauroch claim that their release was accidental, the result of

an  unfortunate  combination  of  magical  energies  across  the

sharns magic wall. Other rumors hint that it was the Shado-

vars themselves who arranged for the release of their old ene-

mies.  What  better  way,  these  tales  ask,  to  earn  the  trust  and

goodwill  of  others  than  by  coming  to  the  aid  of  Evereska?

These same voices whisper that it was the City of Shade that de-

stroyed  the  Cormyrian  city  of  Tilverton,  using  ancient

Netherese magic to reduce the community to a smoking crater.

Thus far, no organized opposition to the City of Shade has

formed, though this state of affairs cannot long endure. It is

only a matter of time before the targets of their enmity dis-

cover  that  the  Shadovars  intend  to  subjugate  them.  Several

groups are actively investigating the Shadovars various activi-

ties. These include the Harpers, who are dedicating an increas-

ing  percentage  of  their  resources  to  investigating  the  shade

threat. To date, they have determined the following:

One of the princes of Shade has quietly obtained a number

of human slaves from the Thayan enclave in Proskur and is

transporting them back to Anauroch by unknown means.

Several  individuals  in  communities  near  the  borders  of

Anauroch  have  disappeared  in  recent  months.  The  only  link

between  the  disappearances  is  that  the  City  of  Shade  was  re-

portedly seen in the sky near these places around the time that

the missing people vanished.

Expeditions from the City of Shade are exploring some pre-

viously unknown ruins in the vicinity of Anauroch. A pair of

Harper scouts have yet to report back after setting out to inves-

tigate just such an expedition somewhere in the Fallen Lands.

Certainly the Red Wizards are also intensely interested in what

goes on in the City of Shade, particularly since by all accounts

its  inhabitants  possess  an  enviable  measure  of  arcane  power.

Unfortunately for the Thayans, all their efforts to entice the

Shadovars into the enclaves have so far failed. The Shadovars

appear to be purposefully avoiding the enclaves, and their atti-

tude  toward  the  idea  of  the  Thayans  mercantile  endeavors

could best be described as contemptuous. The only known ex-

ception took place in the Proskur enclave, and that was only to

negotiate the purchase of human slaves. The zulkirs are now

contemplating  a  policy  of  authorizing  the  enclaves  to  trade

magic  items  in  return  for  solid  information  regarding  the

shades operations and goals. If that fails, the Red Wizards are

obliged to take more direct action to penetrate the veil of se-

crecy surrounding their target.

Encounters

The Shadovars rarely leave the powerful haven of their flying

city. When they do, they travel in groups for protection, by

order of the High Prince. Only a Prince of Shade or a soldier

in the Shadovar army holding the rank of captain or higher

may  leave  the  city  without  escort.  Even  then,  the  traveling

Shadovar  must  have  a  legitimate  reason  for  journeying

through the lands outside the city. The rulers of the City of

Shade  are  extremely  careful  about  whom  among  their  com-

munity they choose to allow outsiders to see, because exercis-

ing  such  care  enables  them  to  better  conceal  their  true

numbers  and  plans.  While  it  is  clear  to  non-Shadovars  that

not every resident of the flying city is a shade, they cannot be

certain  exactly  how  many  areand  the  High  Prince  would

like to keep it this way.

Typical encounters with shades outside their city are with

expeditionary forces assigned to accomplish a particular task,

whether  political,  archeological,  or  murderous.  These  groups

number anywhere from five to one hundred, depending on the

nature of the mission, and are invariably commanded by char-

acters with levels in the shadow adept prestige class. The type

of mission normally dictates whether an arcanist or a soldier is

in command, but all Shadovars are outranked by a member of

the royal family. A Prince of Shade who commands an expedi-

tion expects to be obeyed instantly and unquestioningly. Most

expeditions  include  a  cleric  of  Shar,  a  ranking  officer  of  the

Shadovar army, at least one mid- or low-level arcanist, and a

number of soldiers and laborers befitting the goal of the mis-

sion and the status of the commander.

Only  Hadrhune  is  known  to  travel  without  an  escort,  by

special permission of his lord. When Hadrhune is encountered

without  bodyguards  or  other  accompanying  functionaries,  it

means that he is undertaking a special mission under the au-

thority of the High Prince, usually as his masters direct emis-

sary to some foreign power.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Shades  have  extraordinary  access  to  most  mundane  types  of

magic items, including armor and weapons. What they cant or

dont wish to create for themselves, they can easily purchase.

They  are  amused  by  the  Red  Wizards  attempts  to  subjugate

Faern economically, and they admire the wizards enterprise,

but there is little the Thayan enclaves offer that the Shadovar

do not already possess.

Following is the typical equipment, feats, and ability scores for a

Shadovar soldier. (See the accompanying table for more details.)

The Shadovar soldier is a human fighter/sorcerer, so the human

bonus  feat  and  skill  points  are  included  in  this  summary.  The

Shadovar  soldiers  default  skill  choices  are  Concentration,  Ride

(dire  bat),  Spellcraft,  and  Spot.  Because  the  armor  the  typical

Shadovar soldier wears interferes with spellcasting, most prefer

to cast long-duration spells that enhance their abilities, relying on

magic items such as wands or scrolls to invoke spells in combat.

Ancient Netherese Outpost

Since their return from the Plane of Shadow, the shades have

not  been  idle,  and  accompanying  their  activities  has  been  a

healthy measure of speculation about their true aims and de-

sires. Hardly a civilized culture in Faern has not heard of the

shades and their astonishing flying city. Some cities have even

received  the  dubious  honor  of  a  visit  from  a  contingent  of

these beings or the City of Shade itself. At times the shades

purposes seem clear. They desire to obtain information about

the land from which they departed so long ago, seeking to un-

derstand its history, geography, and inhabitants.

But not all their motivations are as readily visible and under-

stood. Reports have surfaced in recent months, particularly in

those communities located near the great desert of Anauroch,

that sizable numbers of shades have been seen in remote areas,

undertaking unknown activities. The shades turn away any who

venture  too  close  to  these  proceedings,  discouraging  curiosity

with threats and displays of force or magic. Some folk who re-

fused to heed the shades warnings have disappeared. Thus far,

these rumors and reports have not elicited any sort of official

response from the communities in which they are repeated, due

in no small part to the fact that most folk feel a great reluc-

tance to involve themselves in the affairs of the shades.

The following location details one such source of half-un-

derstood rumor: a shade archeological expedition to recover

an  ancient  Netherese  outpost.  The  expedition  includes  the

following members:

OUTPOST LAYOUT

Deep  in  the  heart  of  the  Fallen  Landsa  strip  of  rugged,

windswept  moors  not  far  from  the  western  border  of  Anau-

rocha secret has remained hidden for untold millennia. Con-

cealed by its desolate location and the relentless encroachment

of  the  native  terrain,  this  once  grandiose  outpost  of  the

Netherese  people  slowly  collapsed  in  the  centuries  after  the

fall of its creator culture until it remained merely a shattered

ruin. During its long decline and dissolution, the place became

a  refuge  for  any  number  of  humanoids  and  monsters.  Orcs,

hobgoblins, gnolls, wyverns, manticores, and other creatures in

their turn inhabited the ruins in successive years. They made

their  lairs  amid  the  fallen  pillars,  cracked  foundations,  and

overgrown rubble, not caring what this place might once have

been. All these creatures, like the few travelers who passed by

the  ruins  in  the  long  span  of  years  since  it  fell,  were  com-

pletely  unaware  that  despite  its  barren  appearance  the  de-

stroyed outpost preserved important secrets. They had no way

of knowing that beneath their very feet lay a trove of ancient

knowledge that would make the fortune of any who were suf-

ficiently skilled or lucky enough to locate it.

The Slaves

It might seem at first that the slaves would be eager to throw

their lot in with an adventuring party if it meant gaining their

freedom. However, the slaves are almost completely demoral-

ized by their captivity. They have been to the City of Shade,

and seen what the Shadovars are capable of if provoked. They

have no desire to put their heads on the block. If would-be res-

cuers demonstrate the wherewithal to hold their own against

the Shadovars, the slaves may be tempted to join in the fight.

Even in that instance, however, most of them would prefer to

escape than confront the Shadovar troops.

The Dig

Thanks  to  the  histories  and  maps  preserved  in  the  City  of

Shade, the Shadovars know the approximate location of many

Netherese  sites.  Since  their  return  to  Faern,  they  have  been

busily  engaged  in  seeking  out,  excavating,  and  looting  these

places. Though almost all have been occupied by other races at

one  time  or  another  since  the  fall  of  Netheril,  only  the

Shadovars know where and how to look for the caches of magic

items  and  knowledge  still  hidden  at  many  of  these  old  struc-

tures. Five such sites have been located and excavated thus far,

yielding a trove of Netherese artifacts and information. By far

the most productive digs have been at the old Netherese out-

posts, which were small, independent communities designed to

provide support resources and temporary shelter to Netherese

caravans and travelers.

Prince Brennus led an expedition to this area several months

after the City of Shade first returned to Anauroch. Since then,

a full-scale excavation has been under way to uncover the out-

post and its treasures. Brennus has since returned to the City of

Shade to begin researching the next Netherese site, leaving this

dig under the able command of Arcanist Giraldus, one of his

long-time agents and associates. Captain Leevoth leads the con-

tingent of soldiers attached to the dig. It is their duty to protect

the site from intruders.

The first stage of the excavation is already well under way.

Slaves are clearing away all the earth, vegetation, and smaller

rocks that cover the outpost ruins. Giraldus elected not to use

magic  to  move  this  material  because  he  was  concerned  that

some item of value might be overlooked. Thus the slaves are

not only obliged to uncover the buried structures by hand, but

also to painstakingly sift through every square foot of earth as

they do so in order to ensure that nothing of potential signifi-

cance is accidentally discarded. Giraldus and his fellow arcan-

ists employ spells to move the larger rocks and boulders out of

89

The Shades

the way, but only after they are certain that doing so repre-

sents no threat to the ruins themselves. The buildings of the

outpost are exposed one at a time by this method. By the time

the expedition concludes its work, the slaves will have shifted

innumerable tons of earth entirely by hand. So far, their back-

breaking toil has paid off. The diggers have uncovered and re-

trieved  a  number  of  magic  and  mundane  treasures  that  the

arcanists have cataloged and placed in storage for later return

to the City of Shade.

Meanwhile, the squad of two dozen soldiers charged with

ensuring the security of the expedition grows bored with the

tedium of their assignment. Led by the redoubtable Captain

Leevoth,  they  have  undertaken  a  survey  of  the  land  in  the

vicinity  of  the  dig  site,  amusing  themselves  by  slaying  the

monsters and humanoids they encounter in the vicinity. (All

the members of the expedition appreciate the hunters handi-

work, which offers a refreshing change from the steady diet

of bland, preserved foodstuffs supplied by the City of Shade.)

Approaching the Site

Evidence  of  the  excavation  sitenamely,  the  hills  of  rubble

that the diggers have piled up outside the excavations protec-

tive shadow canopyare plainly visible in the daylight from a

distance of approximately 500 feet. At this distance they look

like  irregular  stone  hillocks,  their  lighter  hue  contrasting

sharply  with  the  unyielding  browns  and  grays  of  the  moor

landscape. Observers can discern a greater level of detail from

approximately 200 feet away in the daylight. From here, an

observer  can  see  that  the  hillocks  are  actually  piles  of  loose

rock. A Spot check (DC 16) allows a character to detect that

some sections of rock in the piles are actually pieces of a larger

structure. Observers can also make out at this distance that the

rock piles are not the only unusual thing present. Near them

stands what looks like a dome-shaped structure made entirely

of some opaque, black substance. At night, the excavation site

is not visible beyond the range of available light.

Observing the Site

Characters  may  wish  to  scout  or  stake  out  the  site  before

trying to enter.

No movement of any kind is visible in or near the site while

the sun is in the sky. Approximately an hour after sunset, the

shadow  canopy is  dissolved.  A  dozen  soldiers  under  Leevoths

command  emerge  from  the  dig  to  reconnoiter  the  area  thor-

oughly  for  evidence  of  intruders  before  giving  the  all-clear

signal. Leevoth and his squad then stride off into the moorlands

to hunt. Hard on the heels of their departure, half a dozen sol-

diers exit the dig and take up sentry positions around the site.

The sentries alter their watch positions once every hour. Four

hours later, they exchange roles with the remaining half-dozen

soldiers, who supervise the slaves as they move unwanted rubble

and earth out of the dig compound and out onto the rock piles.

The hunters normally return between four and five hours after

they  depart,  laden  with  game  and  trophies.  Approximately  an

hour before sunrise, when the cold gray of dawn first begins to

lighten the eastern sky, the shadow canopy is reestablished.

1. The Shadow Canopy

To protect the dig from prying eyes and unwanted guests, Gi-

raldus  has  cast  a  shadow  canopy spell.  From  a  distance,  the

spells effect appears very much like a building or similar shel-

ter. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that this

is  no  ordinary  wall.  Its  purple-black  surface  has  a  glossy,

almost liquid sheen and appearance, not unlike that of an up-

right and semisolid oil slick. The dome of shadow completely

surrounds and covers the dig sight to a height of 25 feet. Inside

the protective dome, it is always night. See the shadow canopy

spell description in the appendix.

2. Mythallar Housing

A circle of massive pillars that resemble inverted cones carved

from  some  unknown  type  of  dark,  reflective  metal  ring  the

ruins  of  a  circular  structure.  This  rotundalike  area  was  once

the physical and magical center of the outpost. The streets of

the community radiated from this central point; their paving

stones  have  long  since  been  pounded  into  smaller  rocks  and

dust by the relentless onslaught of time.

It is readily apparent even to a casual observer that the ma-

terials used to construct this building were not of the standard

variety. The buildings pillars and the remaining portions of its

walls  and  foundation  were  forged  from  a  steel  more  refined

than  any  known  today  in  Faern.  Its  surface  is  polished  to  a

mirror  sheen.  Even  today,  the  metallic  surface  area  of  the

buildings remaining pieces reflects light nearly as well as the

finest  mirror,  and  defies  the  rust  and  corrosion  that  would

surely overcome any lesser alloy. A successful Search check (DC

20) in and around the ruins of the rotunda enables characters

to find small pieces of highly  polished quartz in a  myriad of

colorsred,  blue,  green,  orange,  brown,  pink,  violet,  and

yellowscattered over the ground. A character with 7 or more

ranks in Knowledge (history) recalls that the Netherese made

use of crystalline structures in their most potent magic devices.

A character who makse a successful Knowledge (history) check

(DC 25) realizes that the bits of crystal are the tiny remnants

of a crystalline shell placed over the outposts mythallar to re-

flect its intense magical light, directing and shaping it to vari-

ous purposes by passing it through different-colored crystals.

The mythallar itself exploded during the fall of Netheril.

Shards and fragments of the magic globe remain within the

vicinity of the dig. The expedition intends to locate and re-

trieve as many of them as possible in due course. Some shards

may be found buried in the earth and rock as far as a mile

from the dig site. The shades want to obtain every piece of

the destroyed mythallar, no matter how tiny. Giraldus is will-

ing to trade some minor magic items and a quantity of gold

pieces  (up  to  500)  for  a  single  fragment  or  shard  of  the

mythallar. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, Giraldus re-

quests that Leevoth attempt to obtain the desired pieces in a

more direct fashion.

3. Excavated Library

The slaves are hard at work uncovering the lower remains of

this  structure,  which  was  once  a  three-story  granite  building

with magnificent bas-relief sculptures adorning its outer walls

and  pediments.  The  library  was  the  outposts  repository  of

knowledge, containing tomes and scrolls that detailed a variety

of topics of interest to the Netherese, from history to geogra-

phy, spellcraft to metallurgy. While not nearly as complete as

the libraries in the great floating cities of the day, it was never-

theless an invaluable resource to both the outposts inhabitants

90

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  4:54 PM  Page 91

The Shades

and the travelers they served. Today nothing of the knowledge

housed on the upper three floors of the library remains. Most

of it was carried away by departing Netherese in the wake of

the catastrophe and ended up in other Netherese settlements.

What  little  remained  behind  was  found  by  the  innumerable

humanoids who stumbled onto the outpost ruins. A portion of

the original bas-relief from the south pediment is still extant,

however:  It  depicts  a  Netherese  flying  city  hovering  over  a

dense  forest,  while  in  the  sky  near  the  city  several  dragons

swoop and dive.

Giraldus focused the expeditions efforts on this building first

with a particular goal in mind. He sought the treasures he be-

lieved were still located in the librarys lowest level. Naturally he

explored the upper remains of the library first, not because he

really expected to find anything but because he wanted to be cer-

tain that he could inform Prince Brennus that nothing had been

left to chance. Following his inspection, Giraldus instructed the

slaves  to  demolish  the  upper  floors  in  order  to  expose  the  li-

brarys foundation, which they then removed piece by piece, re-

vealing  a  deep  basement  level  and  the  storage  containers.

Giraldus was not disappointed. The containers yielded several an-

cient but still functioning magic items, which are now secured in

his quarters.

The  slaves  continue  to  work  this  site,  lifting  the  slabs  of

marble from the basement floor and digging into the rock un-

derneath.  Giraldus  believes  that  there  may  be  a  subbasement

below the lowest level uncovered thus far. The results of the

excavation are plainly visible. A flight of marble stairs leads

from what remains of the foundation to the basement floor,

25 feet down into the earth. The walls and floor of the base-

ment  are  cut  from  the  bedrock,  though  the  work  is  much

smoother  than  most  similar  efforts  of  the  present  day.  The

floor of the basement is lined with large flagstones cut from

quartz that is rosy-white in color and polished smooth.

4. Constabulary

The  plain,  gray  granite  walls  of  this  building,  unadorned  by

any decoration, hint at the severity of its original purpose. The

outpost  constabularyits  forces  of  law  and  orderoccupied

this simple two-story structure, and here they detained crimi-

nals and prisoners until their time of judgment.

The main floor of the building consists of a large semicircu-

lar reception area and many smaller rooms. The rooms on the

upper floor are fewer in number and larger in size than those

on the first floor. Unfortunately, no hint of the builders pur-

pose remains. The interior of the structure is barren, stripped

clean  of  all  movable  objects.  The  basement  level,  however,

holds a significant clue for the curious.

The foundation and stairs are constructed of granite blocks,

now covered with several different types of lichen, and the pil-

lars that support the cellars ceiling are shaped from a deep-red

marble  veined  with  black.  A  Search  check  (DC  22)  reveals  a

secret  door  located  in  the  floor  near  the  southwestern-most

pillar.  Another  Search  check  (DC  25)  allows  the  searcher  to

notice that the secret door is operated by grasping a particular

section of the nearby pillar and rotating it counterclockwise.

The door slides away into the floor to the south, revealing a

narrow stone staircase that leads downward 15 feet into an un-

lighted room. This area runs under the entire building and is a

mazelike  cellar  of  individual  holding  cells  where  criminals

were  once  imprisoned.  Each  of  the  approximately  fifty  cells

measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 15 feet high. The cell walls are

constructed from an opaque blue stonelike material that defies

identification. They are only 2 inches thick, and yet are twice

as hard as ordinary granite (hardness 16, 60 hit points).

Each cell has a door constructed of the same material as the

walls (break DC 30) that opens outward, away from the cell,

and  sports  a  narrow  slit  through  which  the  guards  could  ob-

serve the prisoners.

All the cells are empty, but they are still in working order

despite the passage of years. The doors of the cells stand open,

but if closed they lock automatically. All the keys that once op-

erated the cell locks have long since vanished, though the locks

can be opened with an Open Lock check (DC 40).

5. Sanctum of Our Lady of Spells

All that remains of this once magnificent temple is its front

portico,  foundation,  and  supporting  pillarsblue  marble

veined with white, cracked and chipped in various places by the

impact of weather and toolsthat now rise 50 feet into the

sky like stone fingers grasping for the clouds. Engraved deeply

into the granite of the front portico is a single star measuring

50 feet across at its widest point. Despite the years of exposure

to the elements, some of the original enamel that once gave

the  symbol  a  brilliant  blue-white  color  can  still  be  seen.  A

Knowledge  (religion)  or  Knowledge  (history)  check  (DC  20)

allows an observer to identify the symbol as one that was once

associated with the deity Mystra.

This massive edifice was once the outposts temple to the deity

Mystryl, a greater power known to modern residents of Faern

as Mystra, the deity of magic reborn twice anew. Although all

that remains of this once enormous building are its foundations,

staircases,  and  huge  roof  pillars  in  varying  states  of  ruin,  it  is

clear that this must have once been a very imposing structure.

6. Alchemical Seminary

This  two-story  building,  although  smaller  than  some  in  the

outpost, is one of the most important finds of this expedition.

Only a glance is necessary to see that this is the best-preserved

structure in the entire dig area. Its whitewashed granite walls

appear to have been hardly touched by their long exposure to

the elements. Written in Old Netherese high above the lintel

of the double doors marking the entrance are the words The

elements of nature are improved only by the mind.

This  school  was  actually  a  branch  academy  of  a  larger

school  of  alchemical  learning,  the  foremost  example  of  its

kind in all Netheril. What makes this discovery so important

to  the  expedition  members  is  not  merely  the  fact  that  the

schools main subject was alchemy, but rather that the main in-

stitution was located on the very flying city that disappeared

into  the  Plane  of  Shadow.  The  seminary  taught  the  arts  of

alchemy but approached the subject with such a degree of fi-

nesse  and  determination  that  it  required  its  students  to  live

within its confines, much as a magical college might require of

its pupils. Given the buildings historical importance, Giraldus

has instructed the diggers not to touch it until he has had the

opportunity to explore it thoroughly.

Like most of the remaining outpost structures, the interior

rooms of this building are devoid of furniture or other mov-

able  objects.  The  ground  floor  consists  of  a  half-dozen  large

The Shades

rooms of unknown function, and the upper floor contains two

dozen small chambers that might once have been living quar-

ters, given their size and configuration.

An arched portal in a first-floor room reveals a set of black

marble steps that lead down to the basement level. The founda-

tion of the seminary is, like the upper levels, also in remarkably

good shape. Although carved from a single enormous block of

granite, the rock is much darker than normal examples of its

type should be after centuries of exposure to wind and rain. At-

tempting  to  damage  or  remove  a  part  of  the  foundation  is

more difficult than doing so to the other structures in the dig

area, and far more difficult than doing so to normal stone (the

stone of the foundation has hardness 11 and 30 hit points per

inch of thickness). The seminarians treated the foundation with

an  alchemical  toughening  agent  they  devised.  Thousands  of

years later, the agent is still protecting the stone from the rav-

ages of erosion. The basements supporting columns20-foot-

high black marble cylindersare also protected.

In the northwest corner of the foundation stands what ap-

pears to be a large cube of an unknown, dark metal. The cube

measures roughly 5 feet on each side and weighs approximately

600 pounds. A successful Spot check (DC 17) reveals the thin

outline of an opening on the cubes top surface, but even the

most careful scrutiny fails to discern any type of lock or other

obvious means of opening the lid. The cube was the seminarys

securest container, and functioned very much like a safe. Here

the master alchemists stored their greatest secrets from prying

eyes  (their  rivalry  with  the  elementalists  was  something  of  a

cultural legend). Some of these secrets were inside the container

when the cataclysm brought down the empire, and there they

remain, awaiting discovery. Leevoth suspects that there may be

valuable items within the container, but he does not yet know

the secret of opening the lid. He is reluctant to use destructive

magic for fear of damaging whatever is inside.

The  lid  can  be  opened  with  a  successful  Disable  Device

check (DC 30) or smashed open (hardness 8, hp 100).

Trap: The interior of the container and its lid are lined with a

thin, airtight layer of glass. Opening the lid or smashing open

the  container  breaks  the  glass,  allowing  the  alchemical  liquid

within  to  come  into  contact  with  air.  The  liquid  evaporates

quickly, creating a toxic gas. All living creatures within 20 feet

of the container are subject to its effects.

Alchemist Poison Gas: CR 7; Fort save DC 18; 2d6 Con/2d6

Con; Search (DC 30); Disable Device (DC 28).

Treasure: Six flasks of Netherese alchemists fire. This thick,

purplish  goo  is  treated  exactly  like  alchemists  fire  in  the

Players Handbook for the purposes of determining a success-

ful attack as a grenadelike weapon, but the Netherese version

of  this  substance  burns  much  hotter  and  is  harder  to  extin-

guish than its normal counterpart. On the round following a

direct hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage.

The  target  can  take  a  full-round  action  to  attempt  to  extin-

guish  the  flames  by  making  a  Reflex  saving  throw  (DC  18).

Netherese alchemists fire continues to burn for 1 round after

exposure  to  water.  If  a  burning  target  leaps  into  a  body  of

water, the flames burn until the following round.

A  small  wooden  box,  lined  with  black  velvet,  contains  six

lightning globes. This device consists of two metallic hemispheres

joined  to  form  a  globe.  The  top  and  bottom  spheres,  distin-

guished  by  Netherese  symbols,  are  divided  by  a  narrow  seam.

Each  globe  measures  approximately  6  inches  in  diameter  and

weighs  approximately  3  pounds.  Lightning  globes produce  an

electrical discharge that can injure or even kill. A globe can be

thrown as a grenadelike weapon, but it transmits the electrical

discharge  only  when  it  is  properly  armed.  To  arm  a  lightning

globe, the top hemisphere must be rotated a half-turn counter-

clockwise. When this is accomplished, the device emits an audi-

ble click to alert the user that it is now armed. If the user does

not read Netherese, he can make a Decipher Script check (DC

30)  to  distinguish  the  inscription  that  denotes  the  top  hemi-

sphere. When an armed globe is thrown against a creature (as a

ranged touch attack) or any hard surface, it delivers an electrical

shock to everything within 5 feet. This attack deals 3d8 points

of subdual damage to living opponents (Reflex half DC 15).

Two or more lightning globes can be combined to create a

lethal  shock.  By  twisting  the  top  hemisphere  one  full  turn

clockwise, the globe is armed to deliver an electrical discharge

that  arcs  to  another  lightning  globe within  25  feet,  provided

that globe is armed in the same fashion. The shock deals 3d8

points of damage for each globe contributing to it (Reflex half

DC 15 + number of globes contributing).

An armed lightning globe can be deactivated with a success-

ful Disable Device check (DC 20).

A  leather  case  containing  a  4-volume  treatise  entitled The

Principles  of  Alchemical  Interactions,  written  by  Hakewill,  a

famed Netherese alchemist who lived in the years just prior to

the disaster. The books are written in the Old Netherese tongue.

The  tomes  are  bound  in  a  thick,  dark  blue  leather  that  was

treated  with  an  alchemical  preservative,  rendering  them  still

readable today. Once exposed to air they begin to disintegrate if

not preserved magically, falling to pieces within a month. Read-

ing the books requires literacy in Netherese. Anyone who com-

pletes a study of all four volumes gains a +4 enhancement bonus

on all Alchemy checks. The knowledge contained in the books

may be taught to others by one who has read them, but the re-

cipient  receives  only  a  +2  enhancement  bonus  on  Alchemy

checks (the price for receiving the information secondhand).

7. Prefects Palace

This  ruined  fortification  was  once  the  living  quarters  of  the

prefect  who  governed  the  outpost.  When  it  was  extant,  the

structure  was  a  fabulous  example  of  Netherese  architecture,

boasting a floating garden platform above its roof, reached by a

series of levitating terra cotta disks. All that remains of it now

is the foundation, some broken pillars, and a big pile of rubble.

Without some understanding of Netherese architecture or soci-

ety, it would be impossible to determine this structures purpose.

8. Thespians Guild and Performance Hall

This structure is almost completely reduced to rubble, which

looks to be composed almost entirely of massive chunks of a

material that resembles dark-red terra cotta.

Every  Netherese  city,  whether  landbound  or  flying,  and

nearly every outpost could boast at least one venue dedicated

to the performing arts. The Thespians Guild was an associa-

tion  of  singers,  actors,  and  poets  that  was  popular  and  re-

spected throughout the empire. Attending guild performances

was one of the favorite pastimes of the Netherese, particularly

among those who were assigned to distant outposts such as this

one, where organized entertainment was difficult to come by.

93

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/27/01  4:58 PM  Page 94

The Shades

The guilds headquarters and performance area in the out-

post was a circular building topped with two domes, one con-

structed  within  the  other  to  create  an  effective  acoustic

environment. The interior dome was white marble veined in

light blue. The exterior dome was cast in a platinum alloy, but

it was so thin (to achieve the desired acoustic effect) that spells

of  preservation  were  required  to  prevent  it  from  shattering

during harsh winter storms. The remnants of the marble dome

are all that remain of the building now.

Buried within the marble rubble of the hall is an iron box

that measures 6 inches long by 4 inches wide and 2 inches deep.

A character sifting through the rubble can find the box if he

makes  a  successful  Spot  check  (DC  20).  The  box  once  had  a

lock, but it was broken off some time ago. Inside the box is an

item that, at first glance, appears to be some kind of theater

mask. It is shaped like a large white domino mask edged with

stylized feathers cast in thin platinum, such that the wearers

face resembles that of a strange bird. This is a mistress mask,

an item crafted for the exclusive use of Netherese women who

occupied the upper strata of imperial society.

Treasure: Donning the mistress mask conveys the following

benefits on the wearer: darkvision 60 feet, a +4 luck bonus on

saving  throws  against  any  type  of  poison,  and  a  +2  enhance-

ment bonus to Charisma. The mask is usable by creatures of

any gender, but the Netherese considered it acceptable attire

only for women of noble birth.

9. Hall of the Reaver

An  enormous  tile  mosaic  dominates  the  entire  floor  area  of

the foundation that once supported this temple to Targus, the

Netherese  deity  of  war.  The  foundation  itself  is  constructed

from solid granite, while the mosaic is composed of fist-sized

pieces of colored black tiles. Close inspection reveals that the

tiles are actually pieces of polished obsidian. The mosaic creates

a depiction of a pinwheel of five black, snaky arms spinning

counterclockwise,  each  arm  ending  in  an  identical  sword.  A

Knowledge  (religion)  or  Knowledge  (history)  check  (DC  20)

allows an observer to identify the symbol as one that was once

associated with Tempus. During the period when this temple

was in use, it was a three-story structure that housed the clerics

of Targus, an armory, and an area for the practice of skill at

arms. A successful Search check (DC 22) enables a character to

locate  a  secret  panel  within  the  north  wall  of  the  armory,

inside  whichunder  a  layer  of  dust  4  inches  thickis  a

weapon from a bygone age.

Treasure: Storm star (see the appendix).

10. The Farwalkers

Several  merchant  consortiums  specialized  in  the  creation  of

portals throughout Netheril, but the Farwalkers were the most

respected.  The  mercantile  venture  had  an  office  in  almost

every Netherese community of any size, and this outpost was

no exception. Unfortunately, all that remains of this organiza-

tion  are  these  ruins.  The  secret  of  their  near-perfect  portals

vanished along with Netheril.

11. Dwellings

Each of these buildings shows signs of serious wear and tear,

except  for  one  that  is  relatively  intact.  The  majority  of  the

Netherese who once dwelled in the outpost, as well as most of

the travelers and guests who made use of the sites amenities,

lived  in  these  two-story  dwellings.  Only  the  bare  stone  walls

and floors of the structures are still present. Everything con-

nected  to  and  resembling  a  portable  household  article  was

looted untold centuries ago.

The members of the Shadovar expedition have taken these

structures  as  their  temporary  quarters  for  the  duration  of

this mission.

A, B, C, D: Slave Quarters. Twenty-five slaves are packed into

each of these small stone houses. The resulting stench of orc is

so strong that anyone approaching the building closer than 10

feet is immediately aware of the reek. The slaves sleep on crude

straw pallets and are guarded by a pair of sentries stationed at

the  door.  The  slaves  are  permitted  only  the  most  meager  of

personal possessions and have nothing of value.

E:  Leevoths  Quarters. The  Shadovar  army  captain  has  taken

this house for his private dwelling. Two soldiers remain on guard

duty at all times, regardless of whether their captain is present.

They refuse to permit anyone other than Leevoth to enter the

house, and they attack any who try to force their way inside.

Leevoths  room  is  the  only  location  of  interest  inside  the

building. It is spartan in its decor, but at the same time man-

ages to convey a feeling of comfort. The captain sleeps on a

low bed that, while made of cloth and straw, is of somewhat

better quality than those used by his soldiers. The skin of a dire

tiger  functions  as  a  comforter,  and  the  skin  of  a  dire  boar

makes a serviceable rug. On the sill of the rooms single win-

dow, Leevoth has placed several small mementos: the figure of

a  Netherese  woman  carved  from  basalt,  measuring  about  6

inches high, and the figure of a dragon carved from a chunk of

onyx, about 10 inches long.

On the side of the room opposite the bed is a large wooden

packing crate that Leevoth has been using as a desk. A stack of

papers, held down by a fist-sized chunk of rock, records the ac-

tivities of the soldiers since they arrived at the dig. The papers

are written in the Netherese language. Near the papers are sev-

eral pens and a bottle of ink. At the foot of the bed is a wooden

chest, measuring about 2 feet long by 1 1/2 feet wide by 2 feet

tall. It contains several changes of Shadovar clothing, a whet-

stone, two extra daggers, a flask of Netherese brandy, and two

potions of haste.

F, G: Barracks. The interiors of these houses are tidy and or-

ganized, as befits soldiers of the City of Shade. When not on

duty, the soldiers sleep on straw mattresses or relax at one of

the  makeshift  wooden-crate  tables  where  they  talk,  read,

gamble, and play strategy games. There are always 1d4+1 off-

duty soldiers in each house. The soldiers wear their armor until

they retire for the night, but they set their weapons aside upon

entering their quarters.

H: Mess Hall. This stone hall was once a food vendors market,

but its open floorplan now serves admirably as a mess hall for

the dig personnel. Crates and barrels of food and beverages are

stacked at one end of the interior, along with any wild game

that the soldiers have managed to obtain from the surround-

ing wilderness. The soldiers take turns preparing, cooking, and

cleaning up after the meals.

The Zhentarim

I:  Arcanists  Quarters. The  four  arcanistsBenante,  Cujas,

Terenzia,  and  Diophantwho  serve  as  assistants  to  Giraldus

are all quartered in this house. The lower floor is an absolute

rats  nest  of  wooden  chests  containing  dozens  of  reference

books and scrolls brought from the City of Shade, canvas sacks

full of interesting rock fragments that the arcanists have col-

lected,  plates  holding  the  remains  of  half-eaten  meals,  and

straw-filled packing crates holding bits and pieces of the out-

posts architecture. Each of the arcanists has a small private

chamber on the second floor, and these rooms are no neater

than  those  below.  The  arcanists  rooms  each  hold  an  over-

stuffed straw mattress, a makeshift wooden-crate desk, plenty

of writing supplies, and their personal effects.

J: Giralduss Quarters. Giraldus collects the excavations treas-

ures  as  the  slaves  unearth  them  and  stores  them  in  special,

secure  containers  until  he  and  his  fellow  arcanists  can  cata-

logue them properly. A pair of Leevoths shade soldiers remain

on guard duty outside this building at all times, whether Giral-

dus is present or not. Leevoths orders are that no one but Gi-

raldus (and Leevoth) may enter this building without specific

permission.

The  first  floor  of  the  building  consists  of  half  a  dozen

rooms that are empty but for a number of straw-filled wooden

packing crates of various sizes. All but two of the upper rooms

are empty. One is a storage room that holds six packing crates.

Giraldus has placed a glyph of warding on them, ensuring that

anyone  other  than  himself  who  opens  the  crates  is  punished

for  the  transgression.  (See  the  appendix  for  magic  item  and

spell descriptions.)

Shadow  Weave  Glyph  of  Warding  (on  box):  CR  6;  5-ft.

energy blast (5d8); Reflex half (DC 16); Search (DC 20); Dis-

able Device (DC 30).

Treasure (box 1): Ring of wizardry.

Treasure (box 2): Eighteen bars of gold, each measuring 7

inches  long  by  2  inches  thick  by  3  inches  wide.  Each  bar  is

marked with the crest of the Netherese Empire, which a char-

acter can identify by making a successful Knowledge (history)

check (DC 18). These are trade bars of Netherese white gold. A

character can determine the value of a bar with a successful

Appraise check (DC 15): Each 5-pound bar is worth 800 gp in

gold value alone; to a loremaster, or other scholar, they might

well be priceless just for their sheer historical value.

Treasure (box 3): Storm star (see the appendix).

Treasure  (box  4): An  oilcloth  satchel  containing  a  large

book  bound  in  what  appears  to  be  the  hide  of  some  thick-

scaled creature, possibly an alligator or crocodile. The tome

appears to be of great antiquity and fragility. Anyone read-

ing it must make a successful Dexterity check (DC 16) every

time he turns a page in order to avoid tearing that page. The

volume isnt titled, and appears to be handwritten in ancient

Netherese. A character literate in that tongue can read the

book,  which  is  the  private  journal  of  an  alchemist  named

Aratus of Delia. The diary describes the Netherese scholars

unsuccessful  quest  for  documents  he  refers  to  as  The

Nether Scrolls.

Treasure (box 5): Scroll of handfang (see appendix).

Treasure (box 6): Scroll of phantom plow (see appendix).

12. Communal Bath Ruins

The  concave  surface  of  this  elongated  oval  appears,  at  first

glance, to be painted an odd bluish-gray hue. Direct inspection

or a Spot check (DC 15) allows the character to determine that

what appears to be paint is actually a type of material unfa-

miliar to him. The Netherese created this material by combin-

ing a particular type of iron ore that they obtained from a race

of  extinct  dwarves  who  dwelled  in  the  mountains  of  what  is

now Anauroch, with an alchemical substance devised by impe-

rial alchemists. The result was what the Netherese called iron-

skin,  a  waterproof  material  that  was  as  strong  as  a  6-inch

thickness  of  iron,  but  was  only  1  inch  thick.  This  deep  oval

basin is what remains of the great bathhouse that once served

the entire outpost as well as its visitors.

The Zhentarim

Wilimac had barely been able to keep one foot in front of the

other while his group marched across Anauroch, and that was

why he was so happy to spot the tents of a caravan just beyond

the next dune. The others were faring far better than he, prob-

ably  because  their  legs  were  twice  as  long  as  his.  Lets  stop

where that caravan is and camp with them.

Sounds good to me, said Akordia. This blasted sun has been

burning my eyes all day. The dark elf pulled the brim of her

broad hat farther down over her eyes as she continued walking.

They crested the dune and saw the camp sprawled out below

themseven  wagons,  with  tents  and  guards  all  around.

Darvin, a cleric of Lathander, frowned and pointed at a speck

rapidly flapping its way toward the camp. Whats that?

Moktar gasped. A manticore! Its going to attack them!

It has a rider, observed the cleric.

Its probably a Zhentarim wizard! We have to help defend

the  caravan!  Moktar  started  forward,  but  was  brought  up

short by a gesture from the drow.

That is a Zhentarim caravan. We have to get out of here

before were spotted.

The Zhentarim, also known as the Black Network, began as a

group of merchants but has grown to include assassins, spies,

an army, and the backing of the church of Bane. Now in con-

trol of half the area around the Moonsea, the Zhentarim has

increased  its  influence  across  the  continent  and  achieved

footholds  in  the  western  and  southern  regions  of  Faern  as

well. Well armed and supplied, the Zhentarim is supported by

powerful wizards and clerics and led by an archmage and the

Chosen of Bane himself.

Feared by the common folk and bearing an evil reputation,

the Zhentarim is not a foe that one should challenge without

serious  intent.  As  the  organization  and  the  church  of  Bane

grow together, its influence is likely to spread even faster, for

both  groups  seek  complete  domination  of  northern  Faern.

Now even a group of common merchants bearing the symbol

of the Black Network is treated respectfully and kept at arms

length, for the merchants might be under the protection of a

powerful wizard or carry magic far beyond the means of ordi-

nary folk.

The Zhentarim

Brief History

The Black Network was created by the archmage Manshoon,

who rose through the ranks of Zhentil Keep by eliminating his

rivals (including members of his own family). After becoming

a  lord  of  Zhentil  Keep,  he  worked  to  gain  control  over  his

fellow lords. Once that was established, he created a secret soci-

ety, the Zhentarim, which would act independently of Zhentil

Keep  and  provide  him  more  power  than

simple  lordship  could.  Over  time  he

shared  the  leadership  with  apprentices  and

colleagues, increasing the power of the Black

Network  greatly.  One  of  these  converts

was  Fzoul  Chembryl,  who  at  the  time

was the leader of a splinter cult of Bane.

Over the years, the Zhentarim expanded to in-

clude  Darkhold  and  the  Citadel  of  the  Raven.  In

recent decades, the organization encountered a number of

setbacks,  often  through  its  pursuit  of  spellfire  and  conflicts

with powerful mages such as Elminster. One major setback oc-

curred during the Time of Troubles, with the destruction of the

Zhentarims primary deity, Bane. Later, Cyrics involvement in

the  destruction  of  Zhentil  Keep  shattered  the  main  base  of

power of the Zhentarim and led to unfocused and ill-planned ef-

forts of conquest in the following years. Since that time, Fzoul

has  changed  his  allegiance  from  Cyric  to  Xvim  and  then  to

Bane  again,  Zhentil  Keep  has  been  rebuilt,  and  Fzoul  has

become the Zhentarims official leader. Manshoon now acts as a

nearly independent operative. With fewer distractions and the

rise  of  Bane,  the  Zhentarim  has  solidified  its  power  in  the

Moonsea  area,  is  preparing  to  take  complete  control  of  that

region, and then advance its plans in other parts of the world.

The Organization

While the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting gives infor-

mation  on  the  cities  controlled  by  the  Zhentarim,  the  data

given  here  applies  to  the  actual  members  of  the  Zhentarim

within those cities and elsewhere.

Headquarters: Zhentil Keep, the Moonsea.

Members: At least 10,000, mainly located in the Moonsea area.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: Fzoul Chembryl.

Religions: Bane  (primarily),  Cyric  (some  holdouts  in  the

western lands).

Alignment: LE, NE.

Secrecy: Low.

Symbol: The original symbol of the Zhentarim resembles a

stylized spear head bearing a white circle and a long scrawled

Z  in  the  Dethek  alphabet.  Recently,  Fzoul  Chembryl  com-

missioned the creation of a new symbol for the organization: a

black scepter emitting green rays on a gold disc, clutched in the

talons of a black wyrm. The scepter and rays signify the vener-

ation of Bane, the disc stands for wealth, and the black dragon

represents dominion.

The  Black  Network  is  finally  becoming  the  well-organized

group that Manshoon envisioned. Functioning very much like

a secular arm of the church of Bane, the Zhentarim is organ-

ized along a rigid hierarchy of command.

HIERARCHY

The  Zhentarim  hierarchy  follows  a  linear  branching  struc-

ture, with Fzoul Chembryl at the head of the organization.

Several powerful lords report directly to him, with each lord

having  subordinates  who  pass  on  reports  and  requests.  The

Zhentarim  discourage  skipping  ranks  in  the  chain  when

giving orders, so only in times of emergency does Fzoul give

orders  directly  to  one  of  his  generals  officers  without  that

generals knowledge. The exception is

Manshoon,  who  has  Fzouls  permis-

sion to command agents as he pleases in

the pursuit of furthering the goals of the

Zhentarim.

Following is a short list of some of the

major figures of the Zhentarim.

Fzoul  Chembryl (LE  male  human

Clr17/Hie2, Chosen of Bane), High Lord of the

Zhentarim, Tyrant of the Moonsea, is the head of the or-

ganization.  He  divides  his  time  between  the  Citadel  of  the

Raven  and  Zhentil  Keep.  More  information  on  Fzoul  is

available in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Scyllua  Darkhope (LE  female  human  Pal5/Rgr4/Blk6  of

Bane),  Castellan  of  Zhentil  Keep  and  High  Captain  of  the

armies of Zhentil Keep, reports directly to Fzoul. With Fzoul

busy heading both the Zhentarim and the church of Bane, Scyl-

lua  handles  a  lot  of  the  routine  administration  of  the  Keep

itself. More information on her is available in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Lord Kandar Milinal (LE male human Ftr12) is a lord of

the Citadel of the Raven and the right arm of Fzoul. A devout

worshiper of Bane, he looks forward to purging Darkhold of its

Cyricist influences.

Manshoon (LE male human Wiz20/Acm2/Epic3) reports

only to Fzoul but has autonomous control and command au-

thority over all lesser agents of the Zhentarim. More informa-

tion  on  Manshoon  is  available  in  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting. Manshoon is known to use the stasis clone

spell, presented in the appendix.

Selfaril Uoumdolphin (NE male human Ftr20/Rgr2), High

Blade of Mulmaster, is the leader of the Zhentarim within that

city. In truth, this person is Selfarils twin brother Rassendyll,

who killed him and took his name as well as his place. He is

married  to  Dmitra  Flass,  tharchion  of  Eltabbar  in  Thay,

which  puts  him  in  an  interesting  position  should  the  Zhen-

tarim and the Red Wizards ever fall to open warfare.

Buorstag  Hlammythyl (LE  male  human  Ftr9)  is  the

bron  (sheriff)  of  Voonlar  and  a  worshiper  of  Bane.  He  se-

cretly reports to Scyllua so that Voonlar retains the illusion

of independence.

Darik  Berskan (NE  male  human  Sor7)  is  the  appointed

leader of the protectorate of Ylash. A quiet man who wishes

to remain relatively anonymous, he reports to Scyllua.

Zerana Hellesk (LE female human War10) is the military

leader of Teshwave. Crude and prone to murdering underlings

who  fail  her,  she  is  easily  recognizable  by  her  white-streaked

red hair and burn-scarred throat. She reports to Scyllua.

Teldorn Darkhope (LE male human Clr9 of Bane), lord of

the  Zhentarim  in  Mintar,  helped  Fzoul  forge  the  Scepter  of

the Tyrants Eye. His Banite army conquered Mintar, and he

awaits orders to attack other cities. He reports to Fzoul.

The Zhentarim

The  Pereghost (CE  male  human  Ftr7/Chm5  of  Cyric)  is  the

mysterious  commander  of  the  military  forces  at  Darkhold.  He

earned his name from his pale full plate and skull-shaped helm that

makes him appear undead. Though they worship the same deity,

he hates Dhamir Ercals (see below) and plots the mans death.

Dhamir  Ercals (CE  male  human  Clr16  of  Cyric)  is  the

coleader  of  Darkhold  with  the  Pereghost.  He  anticipates  a

holy war with the Banite Zhentarim, but is uncertain how he

would fare, given his unreliable allies and the forces arrayed

against them.

Kara Chermosk (LE female human Ftr9/Clr1 of Bane) is a

mobile  military  leader  currently  assigned  to  Tethyamar

Fortress. She reports to Scyllua. More information about Kara

can be found below.

Verblen (LE male human Ftr9/Rog2) is the Slave Lord

of  Zhentil  Keep  and  reports  to  Fzoul.  He  gained  this  posi-

tion after the former Slave Lord disappeared. Verblen still

enjoys making slaving raids and can be found anywhere the

Zhentarim is active.

Angus Materi (LE male human Ftr9) is captain of the Out-

riders  of  Darkhold,  a  military  squadron.  He  reports  to  the

Pereghost.  Angus  hates  Cormyr  and  attacks  Purple  Dragons

any time he has the opportunity.

Captain Cvaal Daoran (NE male human Ftr5/Clr3 of Bane)

is the leader of the Brothers of the Black Fist, an elite force of

Kandar Milinal.

Mara Kalaliv (LE female half-elf Mnk6) leads the Order

of the Iron Gauntlet, a small group of Zhent monks who wor-

ships Bane. Mara has been given orders by Scyllua to actively

stealth and assassination.

Xulla (LE beholder), Caravan Lord of the Zhentarim, has a

secret  base  of  operations  somewhere  in  Shadowdale.  She  re-

ports to Fzoul and coordinates the activities of the other be-

holder allies of the Black Network.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The Zhentarim used to be an organization that focused mainly

on the control of trade through northern Faern. With the ex-

pansion  of  its  activities  into  murder,  espionage,  extortion,

arson, and all-out warfare, the Zhentarim has become a politi-

cal and military organization with as much power as a small

country  and  the  desire  to  see  the  leaders  of  rival  cities  and

countries fall into line under the banner of the Black Network.

Much  as  they  control  most  of  the  Moonsea,  Manshoon  and

Fzoul  would  like  to  see  the  Zhentarim  eventually  rule  the

lands that stretch all the way westward to the Sword Coast.

To  achieve  these  goals,  Zhentarim  operatives  use  several

key  tactics.  First,  they  have  extensive  merchant  contacts  in

their  own  lands  and  nearby  territories,  and  they  can  move

large amounts of goods safely and quickly through dangerous

lands.  In  particular,  the  Black  Road  through  Anauroch  cuts

weeks from their travel time to the western cities of Faern.

Often  their  goods  consist  of  contraband  or  restricted  items

(such as poison, slaves, drugs, or smokepowder weapons).

Second, they raid enemy caravans, using human soldiers or

recruited gangs of humanoids to drive their competitors into

poverty.  Often  these  caravans  are  simply  captured  and  then

brought  to  their  intended  destination  under  the  flag  of  the

Black Network, providing both a profit from the goods and an

implicit  understanding  from  the  buyer  that  the  Zhentarim

succeed in trade where others fail. Since the Zhents charge es-

sentially the same prices as their competitors, even honest folk

tend to buy from them, despite any misgivings over the source.

Third, they use tactics such as extortion, arson, and murder to

deter their rivals and opponents in mercantile trade and political

activity. Zhentarim agents commonly attack local farmers and

warehouses to delay their trips to market, allowing the Zhents to

sell their goods first. Sometimes an entire village is held hostage

by  a  group  of  Zhentarim  warriors,  preventing  the  import  or

export of needed supplies until the Zhentarims demands are met.

The  Black  Network  also  takes  advantage  of  its  access  to

many  spellcasters  by  secretly  agitating  local  monster  popula-

tions, causing unexpected attacks upon smaller settlements that

a squadron of Zhentarim soldiers (led by the spellcaster respon-

sible for the disturbance) can scare off. Once these soldiers have

established a base camp in or near the settlement, they are re-

markably  difficult  to  dislodge,  especially  because  they  have

standing orders to ally with local greedy merchants to justify

their presence as caravan guards and assume the veneer of in-

vited  guests.  If  local  monsters  are  not  available,  Zhentarim

spellcasters have been known to conjure hideous creatures, with

the same net effect of a rampaging native terror.

RECRUITING

While the Zhentarim has eagerly sought recruits in the past,

the recent upheavals have slowed down its recruiting drives so

it can consolidate existing resources in preparation for future

expansion.

It is still interested in enlisting like-minded wizards to its

cause,  as  well  as  clerics  of  Bane,  but  most  other  individuals

are  turned  away  or  simply  not  offered  positions  within  the

organization.

Once the Zhentarim is prepared to expand again, it will look

for people to fill out all levels of the organization, with a large

percentage of the recruits coming from the church of Bane.

ALLIES

The  greatest  ally  of  the  Zhentarim  is  the  church  of  Bane.

Since the Chosen of Bane leads the Black Network, any wor-

shiper of the Black Hand is inclined to aid any Zhentarim who

asks him or her for help. As the Zhentarim and the church of

Appearance and

Personality

The  following  are  typical  personalities  and  attitudes  for

members  of  the  Zhentarim.  These  descriptions  assume  a

person of chaotic evil alignment known to be a worshiper

of the Black Sun (instead of being disguised).

Zhentarim Cleric of Bane: Imposing and severe, with an

all-encompassing gaze and an aura of control.

Zhentarim Fighter: Subtly cruel, with reflexes honed to

implement commands.

Zhentarim Mage: Scheming and ambitious, with a habit

of looking over potential foes to see which spell it would

take to kill them.

The Zhentarim

Bane become more entwined each day, the Black Network can

count on support from northern Banites. Some caravans that

include  a  cleric  of  Bane  sometimes  have  undead  skeletons

lashed to the undersides of wagons, which can be released with

a few quick tugs if the caravan is attacked. Groups with a high-

level  cleric  or  wizard  are  sometimes  accompanied  by

banedead,  and  a  beast  of  Xvim  (technically  now  a  beast  of

Bane) might accompany privileged groups. At least one sky-

mage,  Glouris  Mristifos,  has  a  hippogriff  touched  by  the

power of the Black Hand in this manner.

Another  powerful  ally  is  a  group  of  beholders  loyal  to

Manshoon, Fzoul, and the church. Wise and experienced be-

holders  such  as  Xulla,  Manxam,  and  Xavlal  can  eliminate

enemy  spellcasters,  charm  an  unlimited  number  of  reticent

contacts,  and  carve  out  secret  hideouts  in  the  hardest  rock.

Additionally, the Zhentarim has made alliances with the drow

in the past, and is moving toward formal arrangements with

the Auzkovyn clan and House Jaelre, exchanging magic and

goods unique to each group.

Unknown  to  nearly  everyone,  Fzoul  arranged  a  tenuous

peace with Khelben Blackstaff of Waterdeep. In exchange for

information  provided  by  the  Blackstaff,  Fzoul  agreed  to

limit Zhentarim expansion to east of the Thunder Peaks for

nearly thirty years. This doesnt prevent the Zhents from de-

fending their western territories, but in all likelihood if those

territories  were  lost  (for  example,  if  Darkhold  were  to  be

taken over by Cyricists), they would have to accept the loss

until  the  agreement  expired.  This  agreement  caused  the

schism between Khelbens faction and the other Harpers and

led  to  the  independence  of  Khelbens  organization,  the

Moonstars.  Khelbens  group  is  almost  unknown  outside  its

membership, and its purpose (and Khelbens reasons for bar-

gaining with the Zhentarim) is also secret.

ENEMIES

The Zhentarim opposes anyone who presents a threat to its two

primary interests: controlling trade and world domination. This

attitude puts the Zhents at odds with the Iron Throne, the Cult

of  the  Dragon,  the  Rundeen,  and  any  evil  group  of  a  more

chaotic or independent inclination. They also have a strong ri-

valry with the church of Cyric because of the Black Networks

ties to the church of Bane. They are traditionally enemies of

the Red Wizards as well, but since the success of the enclaves,

the Zhents have begun to see the advantage of a large group of

neutralor at least not hostilemages producing cheap magic

items they can use for their own purposes.

The Zhentarim also opposes (and is opposed by) groups that

promote good and freedom. It offers a standing bounty for the

heads  of  powerful  Harper  allies  who  have  fought  the  Zhen-

tarim in the past, such as Elminster and several of the Seven

Sisters.  The  Harpers  draw  many  agents  from  the  foes  of  the

Zhentarim,  and  are  rumored  to  be  starting  another  Harper

Hall  in  Ravens  Bluff  to  combat  eastward  expansion  by  the

Black Network. This so-called Ravens Hall has been spoken of

by at least one cowled bard, with hints that those clever enough

to find it may be asked to join. The Zhentarim are trying to

find this secret hall before it grows to become a true problem.

Because of its dependence on the trade route through Anau-

Zhentarim: Tips for the DM

The Zhentarim is active across the northern part of Faern

and has agents, caravans, and soldiers in key points elsewhere

on the continent. At any time, the Zhentarim or mercenaries

in its employ could attack a caravan the heroes are guarding.

A  friendly  merchant  the  player  characters  know  might  be

faced  with  violent  thugs  intent  on  delaying  a  shipment  of

needed goods or convincing him to find a different supplier.

If the heroes are expecting a valuable item (such as a custom-

made magic item) from another town, the caravan bringing

it  might  simply  never  appear,  the  merchants  having  been

slaughtered in transit, or it may arrive bearing the colors of

the Black Network. Heroes would be left wondering if they

should  accept  delivery  of  their  item  peaceably,  or  attack  a

seemingly  legitimate  caravan  that  they  know  has  perpe-

trated a crime.

A  group  of  four  to  ten  Zhentarim  soldiers  with  breast-

plates and shields is more than a match for a group of vil-

lagers, but those soldiers make a good encounter for low-level

heroes. The heroes can come across a small village being ter-

rorized by a gang of these thugs, eliminate the threat (per-

haps with a few getting away to alert their superiors about

adventurers  sticking  their  noses  where  they  dont  belong),

and make friends and contacts among the villagers.

Since  the  church  of  Bane  supports  the  Zhentarim,  the

Zhents often act in accordance with the wishes of the church,

98

particularly if those wishes coincide with their own. If a local

temple to a rival deity has been supporting adventurers in-

volved in thwarting the plans of the Black Network, a gang

of  Banites  and  Zhentarim  can  burn  down  the  temple  one

night,  perhaps  aided  by  an  aerial  fireball assault  from  a

flying mage.

Not  all  the  rogue  monster  activity  encouraged  by  the

Zhentarim  is  a  result  of  threats  made  by  Zhent  agents

against the monsters. The Zhentarim might bribe the mon-

sters, either with money or magic items. A group of heroes

prepared to deal with an ettin may be surprised when they

find that ettin protected by a mage armor spell and enhanced

by  a  cats  grace spell,  all  courtesy  of  a  hidden  Zhentarim

mage. Likewise, even a simple shield other spell cast on an in-

visible Banite cleric makes an umber hulk a more terrifying

opponent.

If the heroes make enemies of the Zhentarim and persist-

ently interfere with their plans, they will eventually become

the targets of assassination attempts. While the Zhentarim is

usually quite willing to attempt assassinations directly, some-

times  it  simply  posts  large  bounties  for  the  heads  of  the

heroes. These bounties are often accompanied by false stories

of depraved and evil acts committed by the heroes, to ruin

their reputation and hopefully convince other good-aligned

groups to target the heroes.

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/28/01  10:01 AM  Page 99

The Zhentarim

roch,  the  Zhentarim  will  almost  certainly  come  into  conflict

with  the  shades  at  some  point  in  the  near  future.  Since  the

shades consider Anauroch to be part of their nation, they are

unlikely to accept armed caravans guarded by spellcasters trav-

eling  through  their  land.  Such  a  conflict  would  certainly  be

troublesome for the Zhents, for while they may be powerful, it

is doubtful that they could effectively combat those who wield

the  magic  of  lost  Netheril.  Losing  the  Anauroch  trade  route

may force the Zhentarim to consider other, southern routes.

On  a  smaller  scale,  the  enemies  of  the  Zhentarim  are  the

people whose lives they ruin or disrupt: reputable merchants, vil-

lagers in frontier areas, or local law enforcement officials who

try to stop shipments of contraband. In or near places where the

Zhents are in power, they are treated coolly by nonmembers, for

while they bring shipments of grain, tools, and weapons, those

same caravan guards might return someday as part of an attack-

ing army. The Zhents also remain alert for agents of the Harpers

or  organizations  such  as  the  Iron  Throne  who  would  love  to

learn more about their plans and representatives in the area.

Encounters

The Zhents believe in strength in numbers. They always travel

in groups, and even lone secret agents and spies fabricate cover

stories and excuses to travel with others.

Zhentarim agents may be encountered as guards for one of

the  Zhent  caravans,  bandits  looting  a  caravan  they  have  at-

tacked, soldiers awaiting deployment into a village to deal with

hostile  monsters,  thugs  or  professional  assassins  preparing

for a murder or other crime, or soldiers on maneuvers near a

Zhentarim  stronghold.  The  Black  Network  also  has  its  own

bands  of  adventurers  who  go  in  search  of  treasure,  informa-

tion, and the chance to make names for themselves.

Groups of traveling Zhentarim always include a spellcaster

of some sort (typically a cleric of Bane, a sorcerer, or a wizard),

unless the group is a patrol of soldiers near a Zhentarim base.

Usually the power of these individuals is exceeded by their am-

bition, but they are all quite eager to prove their worth to the

Black Network and do not hesitate to expend every ounce of

their  magical  might  for  that  purpose.  Truly  important  mis-

sions (including guarding very valuable caravans) tend to have

spellcasters with character levels exceeding those of the other

Zhentarim present.

SAMPLE GROUPS

The sample encounters below are divided into two categories,

caravans and military. Caravan guards, bandits, and thugs

use  the  caravan  grouping  unless  there  are  unusual  circum-

stances. Soldiers of any kind and assassins use the military en-

counter (although skilled assassins are more likely to actually

have  levels  in  the  assassin  prestige  class  and  avoid  traveling

with anyone other than people similarly practiced in stealth).

Most of the Zhentarim encountered are low-level guards, so

the  calculations  for  the  encounter  levels  including  those  and

higher-level  characters  tend  to  break  down  around  EL  10.

While mathematically a group of ten 1st-level guards accompa-

nying an 8th-level sorcerer is an EL 10 encounter, the sorcerer

poses  the  real  threat  and  the  guards  are  of  negligible  impor-

tance to a group of 10th-level characters. Because of this, stan-

dard  encounters  for  Zhentarim  above  EL  10  are  not  listed,

since these encounters are usually specialized groups of higher-

level characters rather than large numbers of low-level guards.

The main variable in more powerful caravan groupings is

the  level  of  the  spellcaster  who  guards  them.  The  EL  of  a

more powerful encounter can be calculated by using single or

multiples of the caravans above, combined with a higher-level

spellcaster.

The military encounters have two EL listings. The first is

for  the  encounter  as  presented,  the  second  is  for  the  same

group without the spellcaster.

Any sorcerer or wizard above 5th level might have levels in

the Zhentarim skymage prestige class (see below).

Zhentarim  Caravan  Encounter  (EL  4): 1  spellcaster  (LE

human or half-orc Clr2 of Bane, Sor2, or Wiz2), 4 guards (LE

human, orc, or half-orc War1).

Zhentarim  Caravan  Encounter  (EL  6): 1  spellcaster  (LE

human or half-orc Clr4 of Bane, Sor4, or Wiz4), 4 guards (LE

human, orc, or half-orc Ftr1).

Zhentarim  Caravan  Encounter  (EL  8): 1  spellcaster  (LE

human or half-orc Clr6 of Bane, Sor6, or Wiz6), 4 guards (LE

human, orc, or half-orc Ftr2).

Zhentarim  Military  Encounter  (EL  6/EL  5): 1  sergeant

(LE human, orc, or half-orc Ftr2), 1 spellcaster (LE human

or  half-orc  Clr2  of  Bane,  Sor2,  or  Wiz2),  4  soldiers  (LE

human, orc, or half-orc Ftr1).

Zhentarim Military Encounter (EL 8/EL 7): 1 lieutenant

(LE human, orc, or half-orc Ftr4), 1 spellcaster (LE human

or  half-orc  Clr5  of  Bane,  Sor5,  or  Wiz5),  1  sergeant  (LE

human, orc, or half-orc Ftr2), 6 soldiers (LE human, orc, or

half-orc Ftr1).

Zhentarim  Military  Encounter  (EL  10/EL  8): 1  captain

(LE human, orc, or half-orc Ftr6), 1 spellcaster (LE human

or  half-orc  Clr8  of  Bane,  Sor8,  or  Wiz8),  1  lieutenant  (LE

human, orc, or half-orc Ftr4), 4 soldiers (LE human, orc, or

half-orc Ftr1).

COMBAT AND TACTICS

With their dependence on common soldiers, the Zhentarim rely

heavily upon the use of tactics to defeat their opponents. Zhen-

tarim soldiers are trained in fighting as a team and supporting

their  fellows.  They  practice  tactics  based  on  just  about  every

sort of encounter they are expected to deal with. They are in-

formed of the typical strategies of their superiors and any tem-

porary allies to allow those people to better use their skills as

well as to prevent harm to themselves (avoiding the spot where

an allied wizard is expected to throw a fireball, for example).

Zhentarim soldiers use the phalanx formation whenever pos-

sible,  and  almost  every  soldier  has  the  Phalanx  Fighting  feat.

With this tactic, the soldiers remain adjacent, using their shields

to protect their neighbors as well as themselves. While this does

mean they tend to stick together (and therefore are more vul-

nerable to area attack spells), since most of their fights involve

opponents without magic, the benefits outweigh the risks. Zhen-

tarim soldiers rarely break from a group unless pursuing lone

opponents or if remaining together is obviously too dangerous

(such as when fighting an enemy mage using area attack spells).

Zhentarim  soldiers  flank  foes  if  possible,  especially  when

working with rogues. When teamed with mages or clerics, they

use  two  main  tactics,  depending  on  their  orders.  If  told  to

defend, they assume defensive formations to guard the spell-

99

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/28/01  10:03 AM  Page 100

The Zhentarim

caster from harm (with fighting defensively and total defense

a common tactic). If told to ignore enemy spellcasters in favor

of  mundane  opponents,  they  aggressively  seek  out  enemy

fighters, leaving hostile spellcasters to be dealt with by their

own magic-wielding allies.

Following is the typical equipment, feats, and ability scores for

a  Zhentarim  fighter.  The  feat  progression  does  not  include

bonus feats for humans or strongheart halflings. Some charac-

ters  may  vary  from  the  listing  by  having  regional  feats.  See

the accompanying table for more details.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The  Zhentarim  controls  entire  cities,  and  its  large  caravans

make regular trips across Faern. It also expects and rewards

loyalty, so incidents of Zhents betraying each other are rare (at

least in the lower and middle levels of the organization).

For many years the Zhents were weakened by the afteref-

fects of the Time of Troubles and their allegiance to Cyric. Ev-

idence  of  these  problems  remains  today  in  Darkhold,  where

troublesome Cyric-worshiping Zhents mix with other less de-

sirable members to create a fortress only tenuously under the

control of the parent organization.

The rigidity and regulation of the Black Networks training

can sometimes be used against its members. A person familiar

with the Zhents standard tactics can prepare and thwart them.

For example, a group that fights in a dispersed pattern or uses

tactics  such  as  bull  rushes  to  separate  Zhentarim  troops

negates the advantages of the Phalanx Fighting feat. A Zhen-

tarim skymages special abilities are largely dependent on the

mages ability to fly, so slaying his special mount or otherwise

grounding the mage reduces his effectiveness.

Finally, because the members of the Black Network are pre-

dominantly  lawful  and  evil,  heroes  carrying  chaotic  or  holy

weapons have a great advantage.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

The Zhents smuggle weapons to all parts of northern Faern

and have master smiths working for them in every city they

control.  This  means  they  tend  to  have  the  best  equipment

available,  with  a  high  incidence  of  masterwork  items.  Com-

pared to other characters of his level, a member of the Zhen-

tarim is generally better equipped. Furthermore, group leaders

have the ability to requisition funds from the network to pay

bribes or acquire unusual items in time of need, so any Zhen-

tarim  encountered  may  have  money  or  special  equipment

above and beyond the norm. For example, a squadron of sol-

diers preparing an ambush in an area of high cliffs might be

equipped  with  potions  of  spider  climb in  addition  to  their

normal equipment. A Zhentarim wizard with the group might

have multiple scrolls of the spell or might prepare it several

times for use on the soldiers.

MAGIC ITEMS AND SUPERNATURAL

ABILITIES

The Banites created the weapon known as the Banesword (see

the  appendix).  Many  of  these  swords  are  in  use  among  the

more  powerful  members  of  the  Zhentarim.  Sometimes  a

Banesword is loaned to a junior member of the Black Network

as a sign of favor or to help overcome a particularly difficult

enemy (especially if that enemy is a follower of Cyric).

Because of the library of spells and stockpiles of items the

Zhentarim owns, its mages have access to the best spells and

magic items appropriate to their power. They are always well

armed  with  at  least  one  offensive  and  one  defensive  magic

item,  with  charged  items  such  as  wands  being  the  most

common. The Zhents often use the stone walk spell to move

from fortress to fortress quickly.

As a whole, the members of the Zhentarim do not have

any  spell-like  or  supernatural  abilities,  relying  upon  tradi-

tional  spellcasting  and  magic  items  to  provide  magic  to

their  agents.  Some  members  particularly  devoted  to  Bane

undergo one of the empowering rituals used in that church,

but these have not reached widespread use among the popu-

lation as a whole.

The Zhentarim

Zhentarim Skymage

Prestige Class

Every Zhentarim caravan is said to be watched over by a spell-

caster of some skill. Many mages join the Zhentarim for the

political  power  it  offers  and  the  access  to  a  large  library  of

spells. Some of these sorcerers and wizards become Zhentarim

skymages, powerful spellcasters who ride strange flying beasts

and serve the Zhentarim by performing acts of espionage and

causing unrest on the frontiers of civilization.

A Zhentarim skymage is an arcane spellcaster who serves the

Zhentarim  as  a  spy  or  armed  deterrent.  Easily  recognized  by

their strange and exotic flying mounts, skymages blast their foes

from  extreme  range,

can  read  the  minds  of

possible  enemies,  and

frequently  spy  on  foes

or  summon  monsters

to  harass  settlements

without  drawing  atten-

tion to the Zhentarim.

Most  Zhentarim

skymages  are  wizards,

with a good number of

sorcerers  in  the  ranks.

A  small  number  of

bards  become  sky-

mages,  despite  the

rigid  lawful  nature  of

the Zhentarim.

There are few rival-

ries  among  the  sky-

mages, mostly focused

on  the  merits  of  dif-

ferent  flying  steeds.

Owners  of  larger  mounts  brag  about  their  size  and  power,

while  those  who  ride  smaller  creatures  tout  the  better  speed

and maneuverability of their pets.

Hit Die: d4.

fulfill all the following criteria.

Skills: Diplomacy 2 ranks, Handle Animal 2 ranks, Knowl-

edge  (geography)  2  ranks,  Ride  2  ranks,  Scry  3  ranks,  Spell-

craft 4 ranks.

Feats: Combat Casting, Iron Will, Mounted Combat.

Special: Member in good standing of the Zhentarim.

CLASS SKILLS

The Zhentarim skymages class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Balance (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),

Diplomacy  (Cha),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Innuendo  (Wis),

Intuit Direction (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge

(geography)  (Int),  Profession  (Wis),  Ride  (Dex),  Scry  (Int),

Spellcraft (Int), and Wilderness Lore (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Zhentarim skymage

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Zhentarim skymages gain

no  proficiency  in

weapons,  armor,  or

shields of any type.

Spells per Day: A

skymage  continues

training  in  magic

while  developing  a

bond  with  a  flying

monster  and  mak-

ing  political  ad-

vances  within  the

Black  Network.

Thus,  when  a  new

skymage  level  is

gained,  the  charac-

ter  increases  his

spellcasting  ability

as  if  he  had  also

gained  a  level  in  a

spellcasting class he

belonged  to  before

he  added  the  pres-

tige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a char-

acter  of  that  class  would  have  gained  (bardic  knowledge,

metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially

means that he adds the level of skymage to the level of some

other  spellcasting  class  the  character  has,  then  determines

spells per day, spells known (if appropriate), spells added to his

spellbook, familiar abilities, and caster level accordingly. If a

character  had  more  than  one  spellcasting  class  before  he

became a skymage, he must decide to which class he adds each

level  of  skymage  for  purposes  of  determining  spellcasting

when he adds the new level.

Bonus  Scrolls  (Ex): At  each  level  of  Zhentarim  skymage

gained,  the  Zhentarim  awards  the  character  a  scroll  of  two

spells of any level he could cast. If the character has a spell-

book, he may instead add these spells to his spellbook immedi-

ately at no cost or time spent.

The Zhentarim

Flying  Mount  (Ex): A  Zhentarim  skymage  can  call  a

flying monster to serve as his personal mount. The mount

cannot have more Hit Dice than the Zhentarim skymages

class level + his Charisma modifier + 1. The mount serves the

skymage  loyally  as  if  it  were  a  druids  or  rangers  animal

companion, and carries the skymage into combat if desired

(if  the  creature  is  strong  enough  to  carry  the  skymage).

Should a flying mount die, the character can replace it after

gaining  two  levels  in  any  spellcasting  class.  Necromancer

skymages sometimes use undead monsters as mounts (includ-

ing  the  animated  corpse  of  a  slain  flying  mount),  and  cer-

tain powerful conjurer skymages even have enslaved fiends

as mounts.

If  the  skymage  suffers  permanent  Charisma  damage  or

loses  enough  levels  that  he  could  no  longer  have  his  flying

mount, the mount flees at the first opportunity, often attack-

ing its former master before doing so.

Suitable  mounts  (and  Hit  Dice)  include  chimera  (9),

criosphinx  (10),  dire  bat  (4),  dragonne  (9),  dragons

(varies),  giant  eagle  (4),  giant  owl  (4),  griffon  (7),  hiera-

cosphinx (9), hippogriff (3), manticore (6), nightmare (6),

peryton (5; see Monsters of Faern), roc (18), sinister (4;

see Monsters of Faern), spider eater (4), wyvern (7), and

yrthak (12).

Flying Feat (Ex): The skymage gains one of the following

feats:  Flyby  Attack,  Mounted  Archery,  Ride-By  Attack,  Spir-

ited Charge, or Trample. The skymage must meet all prerequi-

sites  for  the  feat  before  it  can  be  selected.  The  Flyby  Attack

feat applies to the mount, not to the skymage, and cannot be

used if the skymage is flying without a mount (such as with a

fly spell).

Spell Focus (Ex): The skymage gains the Spell Focus feat.

Share  Spells  (Su): The  skymage  can  share  spells  with  his

flying  mount  as  if  the  mount  were  his  familiar.  This  ability

only works if the skymage is riding the mount, and a shared

spell ends for the mount instantly if the skymage is no longer

riding it.

Skill  Focus  (Ex): The  skymage  gains  the  Skill  Focus  feat,

which must be applied to one of the Zhentarim skymage class

skills.

Enlarge  Spell  (Ex): The  skymage  gains  the  Enlarge  Spell

feat.

Tethyamar Fortress

This data concerns a single Zhentarim stronghold in the west-

ern Dalelands.

Headquarters:  The  Desertsmouth  Mountains,  on  the  edge

of Anauroch.

Members: Over 80, including servants.

Leader: Kara Chermosk.

Religion: Bane.

Secrecy: Medium.

The  monster-infested  tunnels  of  a  once-great  dwarven  king-

dom called Tethyamar lie hidden in the Desertsmouth Moun-

tains. Several hundred years ago the kingdom was overrun by

ogres, orcs, fiends, and powerful wizards, and its citizens scat-

tered  to  nearby  lands.  Tethyamar  was  said  to  be  rich  in  pre-

cious  metals,  and  most  believe  that  the  descendants  of  these

invaders  sleep  on  piles  of  gold  coins  and  wear  garments  of

silver.  While  the  entrances  to  the  true  vaults  and  mines  of

Tethyamar  remain  undiscovered,  several  smaller  mine  en-

trances were found to contain fiend-touched creatures and evil

mages.  The  Zhentarim  has  discovered  one  such  place,  allied

with  the  native  creatures,  and  reopened  mining  operations

deep within, using it as a base of operations and way station for

caravans and military maneuvers.

Called Tethyamar Fortress by the Black Network, the place

holds more than thirty Zhentarim soldiers, a small contingent

of Banite clerics, and a few dozen monstrous allies. The dwar-

ven defenses have been repaired, and the fortress can be locked

down to prevent all but the most determined attackers from

entering. The Zhentarim ships food here, and occupants of the

fortress  hunt  to  supplement  those  supplies,  with  additional

food magically created by the clerics of Bane if necessary. The

Zhentarim only recently established this base, so it is largely

unknown outside the organization. In addition to mundane pa-

trols, the territory near the fortress is watched over by a sky-

mage and his dire bat mount.

If  your  campaign  isnt  set  in  the  Dales  area,  Tethyamar

Fortress can be moved to any hilly or mountainous region lo-

cated outside a major civilized area.

LAYOUT OF THE TETHYAMAR FORTRESS

Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  doors  in  the  tower  are  strong

wooden  doors  with  average  locks  (Open  Lock  DC  25).  The

doors are well maintained (not stuck). Interior doors that do

not  lead  to  bedrooms  are  usually  unlocked.  Because  dwarves

tend to create large, grand spaces, the ceilings of the rooms are

15  feet  or  higher,  while  the  tunnels  are  only  10  feet  high.

Torches  or  lanterns  in  roughly  chiseled  niches  provide  light

for the many human residents.

1. Entrance

This otherwise nondescript section of rock wall is interrupted

by a squat stone arch 10 feet thick. A wooden portcullis closes

this entryway (lift DC 25) but can be opened from the interior

side. This area is usually kept unlit and therefore is harder for

enemies to detect at night.

2. Iron Guardwall

This pair of large iron doors can be opened and closed by metal

cranks on the northern side of the defensive stone towers the

doors slide through. The doors themselves are 2 inches thick. A

single person can easily turn a winch to open or close one of

the doors 5 feet as a full-round action. The doors have flanges

that overlap when both are closed to make it more difficult to

break  them  open.  Each  door  has  two  arrow  slit-sized  holes,

each with an iron plate on the north side that can be slid to

open  or  close  these  holes.  A  similar  structure  is  built  into  a

small platform on the northern face of the top of each stone

tower. These holes are all built at the appropriate height for

a dwarf, so a taller creature must kneel to use them properly.

The Zhentarim normally keeps one of the doors fully closed

and the other open 10 feet, closing them at night or when all

the agents are indoors. Two orc or human soldiers stand guard

here  at  all  times,  ready  to  use  ranged  weapons  through  the

arrow slits once the door has been secured.

The Zhentarim

33A. Guardrooms

These  guardrooms  are  the  sleeping  areas  of  the  nonhuman

troops of the Zhentarim. Each room contains two orc warriors

(CE male orc War1), who put up with the boredom of being

guards  for  humans  because  they  are  well  paid  and  well  fed.

Should the fortress be attacked, they are expected to converge

on area 2 and prevent attackers from penetrating any farther.

The  orcs  are  not  trained  Zhentarim  soldiers  and  do  not  use

Zhent  tactics,  nor  do  they  possess  the  Phalanx  Fighting  feat

(see the appendix).

The  areas  marked  3A  are  each  the  sleeping  quarters  of  a

single ogre (CE male ogre) who fights for the Zhentarim for

the same reasons as the orcs. The ogres are under orders to sup-

port the orcs at the iron guardwall.

P. Privy

The  ceiling  of  this  room  is  has  several  small  tubes  leading

outside the fortress. Outside winds cause these tubes to draw

air  from  elsewhere  in  the  fortress  into  the  room  and

upward,  preventing  odors  from  this  area  from  permeating

other locations.

11. Zhentarim Soldiers

Each  of  these  rooms  is  the  barracks  of  eight  Zhentarim  sol-

diers (LE human or half-orc Ftr1). If the fortress is attacked,

the soldiers (and their leaders in the nearby rooms) have orders

to take defensive positions behind the orcs and ogres in area 2,

supporting them with missile fire and only entering melee if

they are about to be overwhelmed.

4. Great Hall

This  large  open  cavern  has  a  20-foot  ceiling.  Its  walls  are

carved  with  hundreds  of  representations  of  dwarves  fighting

monsters,  forging  weapons,  and  mining.  The  orcs  and  ogres

living here have defaced many of these images. If a Zhentarim

caravan  were  threatened  or  needed  to  hide  for  a  time,  this

cavern would be used for that purpose.

The floor slopes gently upward from here into areas 7 and 16.

5. Orc Sergeants

Once the room of the chief smith of this branch of the Tethya-

mar dwarves, this is now the lair of two orc sergeants (NE male

orc  Bbn3).  While  incapable  of  defeating  an  ogre  singly,  they

teamed up in the past to overpower one of their larger allies,

earning the respect of the ogres and the other orcs.

6. Orc Captain

This room still contains the anvils, tools, and large fireplace

that marked its original purpose as a forge. Now it is the bed-

room of Mar-Gothog, the orc leader (NE male orc Bbn5) that

keeps the orc and ogre troops in line. Mar-Gothogs weapon is a

+1 dwarven waraxe that he took from the long-dead body of a

dwarf he discovered deep in the mines.

7. Mess Hall

Even with most of the furniture broken, this place is still a serv-

iceable mess hall. The orcs and ogres are served first and cleared

out of the mess hall before the humans and half-orcs eat.

8. Servants

This is the room of six servants (N human Com1) who work as

cooks  and  cleaning  crew  for  the  Zhentarim  in  this  facility.

They cower or flee if threatened.

9. Kitchen

Here  the  servants  prepare  food.  The  southwestern  corner  is

stacked with dried supplies.

10. Fireplaces and Storage

More dried goods are stored against the northwest wall of this

room. The five fireplaces are of clever dwarven construction

and have small chimneys that crawl upward to the outside of

the fortress, drawing smoke outward.

12. Sergeants and Lieutenant

Each  of  these  rooms  is  the  barracks  of  two  Zhentarim  ser-

geants (LE human or half-orc Ftr2) and one lieutenant (LE

human or half-orc Ftr4). They remain with and coordinate the

attacks of the Zhentarim soldiers.

13. Small Barracks

Each of these small rooms is the bedroom of two Zhentarim

soldiers (LE human or half-orc Ftr1). The officers offer these

smaller rooms as rewards for dedicated soldiers.

14. Meeting Room

This  room  has  a  large,  roughly  made  wooden  table  running

nearly  its  entire  length.  The  officers  and  lady  Kara  use  this

room to discuss plans and inform the soldiers of new assign-

ments.

15. Zhentarim Captain

This is the personal chamber of the sole human captain (LE

male human Ftr6) of this facility.

16. Temple Annex

This  area  was  once  used  as  a  waiting  room  for  the  fortresss

original  temple,  and  it  serves  a  similar  purpose  for  its  new

owners. Anything that layfolk need to discuss with the clerics

of Bane that isnt private and doesnt involve actual worship

ceremonies takes place here. The walls, floor, and ceiling were

once decorated with images of dwarves, hammers, and anvils,

but they have been painted over with hundreds of symbols of

Bane, particularly on the faces of any figures depicted. The un-

hallow spell in area 17 extends through this room.

17. Temple

This simple temple to Moradin was defiled and reconsecrated

in  the  name  of  Bane.  Now  its  smooth  floor  leads  to  a  dais

topped  with  an  altar  of  black  stone,  above  which  hangs  a  4-

foot-diameter  symbol  of  Bane  made  out  of  blackened  iron.

Flanking the altar are a pair of baneguards. The area is pro-

tected by an unhallow spell (with a silence spell attached to it

affecting  only  those  that  are  not  worshipers  of  Bane).  If  in-

truders make it into area 4 or beyond, the clerics attempt to

draw the battle into here to take advantage of the unhallow

spells benefits.

Zhentarim Tethyamar Outpost

620_T11989_001_LoDCh01v3.qxd  8/28/01  10:11 AM  Page 106

The Zhentarim

18. Storage

This room is additional storage space for the Zhentarim, pri-

marily used for dried foodstuffs.

19. Lesser Cleric

Each of these rooms is inhabited by a Zhentarim cleric (LE

human Clr3 of Bane). If the fortress is attacked, the clerics

go to area 20 to defend the greater cleric. These rooms were

once  used  by  clerics  of  Moradin,  but  all  the  previous  reli-

gious iconography has been chipped away and replaced with

that of Bane.

20. Greater Cleric

When  the  kingdom  of  Tethyamar  was  more  than  just  a

memory, a cleric of Moradin used this room as his personal

sanctuary.  With  the  coming  of  the  Zhentarim,  this  long-

abandoned  room  was  converted  to  the  use  of  the  fortresss

most  powerful  cleric,  Alethra  Shemoskarn  (LE  female

human Clr8 of Bane). Alethra has run the worship cycle of

Bane  to  Cyric  to  Xvim  to  Bane  again,  just  like  Fzoul,  and

Fzoul  has  personally  commended  Alethra  for  her  persever-

ance. She is a shrewd woman approaching her fortieth year,

and  knows  that  she  can  expect  years  of  proud  service  and

reward ahead of her.

21. Portal Chamber

This area was previously used as an audience chamber when

important officials from the main halls of Tethyamar came

to visit this fortress, and the large stone throne and chairs on

the north wall are largely intact. In the center of the room is

a  large  metal  and  wood  scaffold  supporting  a  wooden  plat-

form 12 feet above the ground. The platform is the start and

destination point of a portal leading into the courtyard of a

barracks in Zhentil Keep (a matching portal there leads back

to  this  location).  The  portal is  a  keyed  portal triggered  by  a

certain phrase (Power for the Black Network, power for the

Zhentarim)  and  only  works  one  every  tenday.  It  was  built

upon a scaffold so that if the Zhentarim ever needed to tem-

porarily abandon this location, the support structure could be

moved so that creatures at ground level would be less likely to

discover it. The portal is used regularly to transport news, re-

ceive goods, and relocate troops.

22. Visitors Chamber

When important visitors came to the dwarven fortress, this

suite  was  lent  to  them  for  the  duration  of  their  stay.  One

soldier  is  on  duty  here  at  all  times.  The  large  pillar  in  the

center of the room bears chipped and abused images of dwar-

ven deities.

23. Fortress Commander

Kara Chermosk, the commander of this fortress, currently

uses  this  bedroom.  If  the  place  is  attacked,  she  meets  with

her second in command Segori (see area 24), Xandos the sky-

mage  (see  area  25A),  and  her  fiendish  allies,  then  attacks

with  them  in  a  group  to  destroy  any  invaders  her  troops

havent slain.

Born  in  Zhentil  Keep  and  raised  by  Zhentarim  merchants,

Kara lived her whole life under the shadow of the Black Net-

work.  Unlike  many  who  grew  to  fear  and  resent  the  Zhen-

tarim,  Kara  realized  that  the  Zhents  had  all  the  power  and

that she would need to join them if she wanted to have a place

of any importance in the world. She trained as a soldier and

spent several years guarding caravans traversing Anaurochs

Black Road, and joined the church of Bane before returning to

her  previous  career.  She  has  risen  through  the  ranks  to

become a commander and was promoted to base commander

with  her  assignment  to  Tethyamar  Fortress,  which  has

pleased her greatly.

Kara is stern and leads her soldiers with an iron hand. Her

ability to negotiate allowed the Zhentarim to make an alliance

with  the  fiendish  creatures  they  found  in  the  old  dwarven

fortress.  She  expects  instant  compliance  with  her  orders  and

tolerates  no  backtalk,  but  her  soldiers  respect  ensures  that

they obey her unquestioningly.

Her Banesword is on loan from the vaults of Zhentil Keep,

a gift from Scyllua Darkhope for her excellent service in the

name of Bane and the Black Network.

24. Lieutenant Commander

This room normally houses the guards for whatever guest is

staying in area 23. Now it is the room of the fortresss second

in  command,  captain  Segori  Meristaak  (LE  male  human

Ftr6). He is Karas lover, but she doesnt allow them to stay in

the  same  room  when  they  are  outside  Zhentarim-controlled

cities. He loves Kara and stays by her side in melee, and if she

is killed he will follow the person responsible to the ends of the

earth until she is avenged.

25AC. Staterooms

The  oldest  and  most  influential  residents  of  the  dwarven

fortress  once  used  these  three  staterooms.  Now  they  are  the

homes  of  the  skymage  and  the  most  powerful  allies  of  the

Zhentarim.

Kara Chermosk directs a Zhentarim attack

Area  25A  is  the  room  of  Xandos  (NE  male  human

Wiz7/Zhentarim Skymage 1) and his flying mount, Skirrak (N

dire  bat).  Xandos  is  friendly  but  lusts  for  power.  He  prefers

fighting outdoors, and so if people manage to enter the fortress,

he tries to flee with Skirrak into the mines or sneak the pair of

them past the fight invisibly.

Area  25B  is  the  room  of  Goluz  (NE  fiendish  ogre  Bbn1).

Goluz is quite intelligent (12 Int) but prefers to act stupid so

people will underestimate him.

Area 25C is the room of Tsurk (CE female tiefling Sor6), a

hateful and rebellious woman whose only loyalty is to herself.

She stayed with her fiendish allies because she felt they could

help  protect  her  and  has  allied  with  the  Zhentarim  for  the

same  reason.  If  the  battle  turns  against  the  Zhentarim,  she

tries to escape. She looks human except for her red eyes and

the 4-inch horns growing from the back of her head.

26. Tiefling Fighters

These two rooms house Hetten and Zozzul (NE male tiefling

Ftr4),  brothers  with  same  fiendish  traits  (cloven  hooves  in-

stead of feet). They have thrown in their lot with the Zhen-

tarim and hope to be able to move to a city such as Zhentil

Keep in the near future.

27. Tiefling Rogues

These are the rooms of Kyros and Savuri (NE female tiefling

Rog4),  who  have  short,  prehensile  tails  and  oversized  hands.

They enjoy climbing about the walls and ceiling of the cavern,

and prefer to leap upon their foes from above.

28. Tiefling Rangers

These are the rooms of Kleb (LE female tiefling Rgr3) and

Sivvlur  (NE  male  tiefling  Rgr3).  Kleb  has  pale  white  skin

and  long  canine  teeth.  Sivvlur  has  a  small  pair  of  vestigial

hands growing from his neck. They follow Goluz, because he

once saved their lives. Their favored enemy is aberrations.

29. Tiefling Monk

Rekart (LE male tiefling Mnk5) is an outcast even among the

fiend-touched in this place. He is completely hairless, and the

skin  on  his  head  is  nearly  transparent,  revealing  most  of  his

skull. He follows Tsurk, if only because he feels that he should

be there to balance out whatever chaos she causes.

30. Mine Access

This tunnel leads downward into the mines. Most of the ore

was  depleted  during  the  habitation  of  the  dwarves,  but  the

Zhentarim  uses  magic  and  smokepowder to  blast  open  new

areas  in  search  of  more  ore.  Thirty  miners  work  down  here,

bearing  continual  flame lamps  and  rarely  coming  to  the

fortress except to resupply their rations.

About 20 yards down this tunnel is a spring that provides

sufficient  water  for  the  residents  of  the  fortress  and  the

miners. In the deepest part of the mines are some narrow tun-

nels  that  connect  with  the  upper  reaches  of  the  Underdark.

The fiendish creatures and ogres know their way around those

tunnels, since they came up into the fortress from there.

Referring to the following groups as minor

organizations  is  something  of  a  misnomer.

While some are smaller in number

and focus than the groups discussed

in the previous chapter, they pose no less of a threat within

their spheres of influence. Some, like the Shadow Thieves, are

poised to move beyond their current areas into regions unpre-

pared to deal with them. Heroes who interfere with the plans

of these groups protect not only local interests, but those of all

of Faern.

The Arcane

Brotherhood

Nenad paused, tapping the feather quill absentmindedly on the

parchment as he gathered his thoughts. He resumed writing in

his small book, noting the days activities.

Shadowed the Master of the East Tower again today. He

met with the Zhent agents you described to me before I began

this mission. I was close enough to listen, but the Zhents used a

spell  or  device  to  mask  their  conversation.  Next  time,  I  will

place  myself  in  such  a  position  so  that  I  may  attempt  to  read

their lips.

The half-elf rogue closed his eyes and stretched his legs. Fol-

lowing an overwizard was the fun part. Reporting his comings

and goings was far from fun, but necessary.

Nenad froze when he heard the floorboard creak. His short

sword lay on his bed, as well as his potion belt.

Please make no sudden movements, the voice behind him

intoned, for I have no wish to kill you, Nenad of the Harpers.

Caught! But how? And by whom?

Keep your hands in sight, and place that knife you keep in

your left sleeve on the table. Oh, and would you be so kind as to

slip  off  your  blade  boots,  too?  Thats  a  good  sport.  Someone

knows an awful lot about me, Nenad thought to himself.

What now? Nenad asked in a calm, level voice.

His still unknown captor said, You are wanted in the Host

Tower.  Arklem  Greeth  is  wondering  why  you  are  following

Overwizard Domine, and wishes to chat with you. Come along

now, will you?

Shivering with dread, the Harper agent had no choice but to

comply with his escort.

The Arcane Brotherhood is a society of evil mages that oper-

ates, more or less openly, out of the city of Luskan. While the

City  of  Sails  is  ruled  ostensibly  by  five  High  Captains,  all

former pirate lords, the Brotherhood is the true power behind

the city, as well as the source of its notoriously aggressive atti-

tude toward nearly every other nation and power in the Sword

Coast North. While the Brotherhood generally avoids conflicts

with  greater  powers,  such  as  Waterdeep  and  Amn,  it  has  no

hesitation about harassing smaller cities and weaker merchants

who  cannot  defend  themselves  easily.  The  archwizards  who

rule the Brotherhood have their fingers in any number of un-

savory  pies,  including  piracy,  slavery,  drug  trafficking,  and

smuggling,  in  addition  to  legitimate  trading  ventures.  The

Brotherhood  undertakes  these  activities  not  for  their  own

value but as means to an end: establishing economic and polit-

ical sovereignty over the North.

In  times  past,  the  peoples  of  Neverwinter,  Longsaddle,

Mirabar,  and  other  targets  of  the  Brotherhoods  ambitions

could  rely  on  internal  disputes  and  rivalries  between  the

senior mages of the Brotherhood to prevent the organization

from bringing its full power to bear on any one target. The

wizards  and  sorcerers  who  led  the  society  from  their  lofty

perches  in  Luskans  Host  Tower  Arcane  considered  one  an-

other  rivals  as  much  as  comrades,  and  they  plotted  against

one another as intensely and brazenly as they did against their

intended  victims.  This  internecine  strife  culminated  several

years ago with the assassination of a key mage by a pair of his

own  fellows,  followed  by  an  unsuccessful  coup  attempt  that

left the Brotherhood in confused disarray. Cities throughout

the  Sword  Coast  North  breathed  a  collective  sigh  of  relief

when  the  Brotherhoods  attacks  on  shipping  and  caravans

slowed and then all but ceased. When the Archmage Arcane

of the Host Tower had not been seen in nearly a year, some

people dared hope that the Brotherhood would wither and die,

leaving honest folk with one less threat to worry about in this

already dangerous part of Faern.

These  hopes  were  dashed  when  Brotherhood-sponsored

forces  returned  to  the  sea  lanes  and  trade  routes  with  a

vengeance  immediately  after  Midwinter  in  1372  DR.

Luskan pirates struck swiftly and successfully against inde-

pendent merchant ships off Neverwinter. A strong force of

slavers  believed  to  be  working  at  the  behest  of  the

Brotherhood attacked a caravan bound for Longsaddle, car-

rying off not only its trade goods but its entire crew as

well.  Because  of  these  events,  word  is  spreading

throughout  the  Sword  Coast  North  that  the

Archmage  Arcane  has  returned  to  the  Host

Tower,  and  that  he  has  redoubled  the

Brotherhoods efforts to control the neigh-

boring lands. Some folk in Luskan whisper

that the Archmages return was accompa-

nied by fell creatures that have been seen

both high in the spires of the Host Tower

and  in  the  shadowed  streets  of  Luskan.

Whether this gossip is accurate or the stuff

of paranoid speculation, one thing seems clear:

A reinvigorated Arcane Brotherhood means dark

times ahead for the North.

Brief History

None can say with any certainty exactly when the Host Tower

was  constructed  on  the  island  at  the  mouth  of  the  Mirar

River,  or  what  hands  raised  it,  or  just  when  the  Arcane

Brotherhood  first  began  inhabiting  the  tower  and  making

their  presence  felt  in  the  city  of  Luskan.  The  first  known

mention of the place is in Mirar Saga, an oral tradition that

narrates the arrival of the first Northlander pirates to settle

in the Sword Coast region. These tales were first collected and

recorded  in  1237  DR  by  Malcer  Truequill,  a  loremaster  of

Waterdeep.  According  to  this  chronicle,  a  band  of

Northlander explorers arrived at the mouth of the Mirar just

ahead  of  a  fearsome  storm,  seeking  shelter  along  the  river-

bank. Instead they found what appeared to be a gigantic tree

made entirely of stone, its bare branches rising hundreds of

feet into the air above an island in the midst of the rivers cur-

rent.  The  eldritch  sight  struck  fear  into  the  hearts  of  the

raiders,  but  the  storm  was  closing  in  fast  and  they  had  no

better  shelter  available.  With  heavy  hearts  and  weapons  in

hand, the Northlanders entered the stone tree to escape the

murderous  winds  and  freezing  sleet.  The  saga  does  not  tell

what fate overcame the half of the raiding party that failed to

emerge from the tower, only that the survivors fled that ter-

rible place even as the storm was at its height, preferring to

take their chances with the raging elements rather than face

whatever lurked within that grim stone spire.

Today,  the  towers  reputation  is  just  as  evil,  though  the

source  of  this  dread  is  somewhat  more  visible  and  no  longer

nameless. The stone tree still sits where the Northlander ex-

plorers found it, rising high over the crowded streets and rocky

shoreline of Luskan. Its eerie silhouette casts a baleful shadow

over  the  city,  and  citizens  in  the  streets  tend  to  glance  fre-

quently  at  its  bizarre  shape,  as  if  they  expect  something  un-

speakable  to  emerge  from  its  depths  at  any  moment.  The

tower is no longer merely the setting of a strange Northlander

fable. Now it is the headquarters of the Arcane Brotherhood, a

conclave of evil mages dedicated to the hateful pursuit of con-

quest and domination.

Learned  folk  differ  on  exactly  when  the  Arcane  Brother-

hood first appeared in Luskan, and on what precisely its activ-

ities have been in the years that followed. General consensus

agrees that Arklem Greeth, the Archmage Arcane, arrived in

Luskan some time around 1311 DR. Since then the Archmage

has  built  his  evil  brotherhood  slowly,  mage  by  mage,  at-

tracting  them  to  the  Host  Tower  through  promises

of great power and wealth. Members of the soci-

ety  have  come  and  gone  over  the  years,  but

Arklem Greeth has remained the head of the

organization since its inception.

Greeths ambition of the last two decades

has remained the same: to control the North.

Some of the members of his organization he

specifically recruited because he believed they

could  help  him  achieve  his  goals.  Others

sought out the Host Tower and its evil conclave

on their own initiative, either to join in the effort

to dominate the North or simply to reap the bene-

fits of membership in such a society. Greeth and his fol-

lowers have ruled Luskan itself for perhaps 15 years, ever since

the  High  Captains  first  came  under  their  sway.  Fear  of  the

archwizards  power,  coupled  with  the  substantial  profit  from

their sponsored illicit activities, keeps the High Captains loyal

and in line. The Brotherhood views the control of the city as

crucial to its long-range plans, since the conquest of the area re-

quires  a  secure  and  well-defended  base  of  operations,  not  to

mention the means of raising the necessary gold to fund the or-

ganizations magical research and other activities. With the city

leaders firmly in its pocket, the Brotherhood is in a position to

know nearly everything of importance that occurs in the city.

To date, the methods that the Brotherhood has employed in

its quest to rule the North have yielded mixed results at best.

Waging a war of piracy and raiding against any target that the

High Captains believe they can conquer has proven only mar-

ginally  effective.  While  Luskan  (and  therefore  the  Brother-

hood) is definitely a force of some power in the mercantile and

political  life  of  the  Sword  Coast,  it  is  a  minor  power  whose

reach  has  often  exceeded  its  grasp.  Attempts  within  the  last

five  years  to  conquer  the  naval  powers  of  Mintarn  and  Or-

lumbor  were  unsuccessful  and  costly,  while  Luskans  short-

lived war against Lantan was nothing short of disastrous. The

Luskan  navy  did  manage  to  defeat  the  Northlanders  of

Ruathym  on  their  second  attempt  and  seized  control  of  the

island in 1361 DR, but the Lords Alliance forced Luskan to

give up its conquest.

It was immediately on the heels of the Lantan debacle that

the Brotherhood began its decline. Internal rivalry had always

plagued the society, but never was it as fierce and bloody as in

The Arcane Brotherhood

the last five years. Two of the ranking mages assassinated the

Archmages  top  assistant  and  plotted  to  overthrow  Greeth

himself. The Archmage didnt help matters, allowing himself

to be preoccupied by something he considered far more press-

ing than his societys goalshis own mortality. Distracted by

his  search  for  a  means  to  prolong  his  life,  Arklem  Greeth

didnt see last years coup attempt coming until it was almost

too  late.  As  it  was,  he  barely  escaped  with  his  life  and  was

forced to flee Luskan for Mirabar, where he has remained for

the better part of the last year. It was in that city, during his

convalescence,  that  he  made  a  new  friend  in  Nyphithys,  an

erinyes  who  offered  to  grant  the  frail,  wounded  archwizard

what  he  had  so  desperately  sought.  In  return,  Arklem  need

only allow Nyphithys and her associates to help the Brother-

hood win the North. Greeth quickly accepted the bargain, and

while his would-be successors squabbled among themselves for

the spoils of their victory, Arklem underwent the transforma-

tion from human to lich. When the process was done, he and

his newfound compatriots returned to Luskan.

What  they  found  there  didnt  surprise  Arklem.  The  Host

Tower was half vacant, many of its mages and servants having

fled the internal civil war for less dangerous climes. The orga-

nizations structure was close to complete ruin, and the High

Captains  were  acting  with  total  disregard  for  the  Brother-

hoods interests. Acting quickly, the Archmage and Nyphithys

entered the Host Tower and destroyed the traitors. The streets

of Luskan were bathed in the hellish glow that flashed inter-

mittently  from  the  tower,  accompanied  by  the  terrifying

sounds of mortal beings enduring unimaginably painful fates.

The High Captains found themselves summoned to the Host

Tower the following morning. The story of the Captains fran-

tic departure from the tower an hour hence, heightened by the

description  of  their  ashen  faces  and  terrified  demeanor,  has

proven  popular  in  the  retelling  throughout  the  taverns  of

Luskan  and  beyond.  More  alarming,  however,  are  the  asser-

tions that strange, awful creatures have been seen around the

stone spires of the Host Tower since the Archmages return.

Since then, Arklem and Nyphithys have labored ceaselessly

to rebuild the Brotherhood. Promoting loyal mages to stations

of authority, seeking out replacements for the executed trai-

tors,  and  laying  out  a  plan  for  the  societys  conquest  of  the

North occupies the bulk of their time. At Nyphithyss sugges-

tion,  the  lich  agreed  to  focus  most  of  the  Brotherhoods  re-

gained  energy  and  resources  on  a  single  target:  the  newly

created confederation known as the Silver Marches.

The Organization

The  Arcane  Brotherhood  consists  almost  entirely  of  mages.

Nonmages are hired and employed to perform those tasks that

the mages cant or dont wish to undertake for themselves.

What  follows  are  the  statistics  for  the  members  of  the

Arcane Brotherhood stationed in Luskan, including the ruling

archwizards,  lesser  mages  and  apprentices,  bodyguards,  and

other members active in the City of Sails. The wizards employ

other minor functionaries such as messengers, informants, and

spies, who are not full-fledged members of their organization

(and thus are not privy to more information than is absolutely

necessary for them to accomplish their assigned tasks). These

folk are not counted in the following statistics.

Headquarters: The Host Tower of the Arcane, in Luskan.

Members: 130.

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: Arklem  Greeth,  Archmage  Arcane  of  the  Host

Tower.

Religion: Auril, Bane, Umberlee.

Alignment: CE, LE, NE.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: A warship, reddish-brown outlined in black, riding

on dark blue ocean waves. Above the ship is a short rise of dark

purplish-black land, and atop the rise is a stylized representa-

tion  of  the  Host  Tower  (depicting  its  central  body  and  four

turrets)  in  black  silhouette.  All  the  arcane  spellcasters  who

count themselves members of the Brotherhood naturally each

use  their  own  personal  sigil  when  requiring  a  recognizable

symbol  for  mundane  matters  (such  as  affixing  a  seal  to  a

letter). Only the Archmage and the overwizards have the au-

thority to use the Brotherhoods official sigil.

HIERARCHY

The  Archmage  Arcane,  who  appoints  the  four  overwizards

who oversee the groups operations, rules the Brotherhood.

The Archmage Arcane

The Archmage Arcane is more than merely the first among

equals: He is the supreme ruler of the Arcane Brotherhood. In

a very real sense, the organization belongs to the Archmage. It

is his to do with as he pleases, and none have the authority to

challenge him or his word.

The Archmage Arcane seldom leaves his private chambers

in the Host Tower. When he wishes to speak with any of the

other  members  of  the  organization,  he  typically  summons

them  to  his  audience  hall.  Otherwise  he  remains  in  solitude,

except for frequent visits from Nyphithys for the purpose of

planning the means by which they intend to bring the Silver

Marches under their control.

Arklem Greeth (LE male lich Wiz16/Acm2) is the Arch-

mage Arcane of the Host Tower. He was, until quite recently,

a hateful, embittered old man. In fact, he was a very old man,

having  prolonged  his  existence  far  beyond  its  natural  limits

through the aid of wish spells and other powerful magic. His

frail form was bent nearly double with age, his every waking

minute  wracked  with  infirmity  and  ill  health,  as  the  sheer

weight of years began to erode the efficacy of the magic sus-

taining his withered shell. The vast majority of his unnaturally

long life span had been spent seeking the secrets of Faerns

most powerful magic, traveling the length and breadth of the

world  to  plumb  the  depths  of  arcane  knowledge  in  such  far-

flung lands as Mulhorand, Thay, Zakhara, and even Kara-Tur.

(It was only in recent decades that he experienced the desire to

control a major portion of Faern and to establish himself as a

power in his own right, believing that an individual possessing

such vast knowledge and power must necessarily be destined to

rule.)

But death stalked him relentlessly as his life-sustaining magic

failed, and Arklem realized many more years would be required

to  accomplish  his  goals.  His  thoughts  turned  inward,  and  he

began to contemplate the options available to him. He became

so distracted that he neglected the health of the organization he

110

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/23/01  3:50 PM  Page 111

The Arcane Brotherhood

had  built.  Two  of  his  more  talented  minions,  Eldeluc  and

Valkebar, assassinated the Wizard of Green Fire, who had been

the Archmages top lieutenant. The two killers then set their

sights on the Archmage himself, catching him unaware in his

bedchamber  on  the  night  of  14  Eleint  last  year  (1371  DR).

Thanks  to  the  magical  protections  he  always  kept  in  place,

Arklem fled the Host Tower with his life, but he was sorely in-

jured. Making use of a preplanned escape route, he traveled to

Mirabar. There he went to ground in a bolthole hed prepared

years  ago  against  just  such  an  emergency,  and  contemplated

his fate while he recovered, slowly, from his wounds.

It  was  in  this  state  that  Nyphithys  first  visited  him.  The

devil played to her strengths, taking advantage of the wizards

frailty of body and spirit to overwhelm him with her charms.

By the time she offered to share the secret of lichdom, Arklem

was  only  too  ready  to  become  her  willing  partner.  The  devil

helped her victim gather the necessary knowledge and ingredi-

ents for his transformation into a lich, and then accompanied

him back to the Host Tower so that she (and a few summoned

baatezu) could aid in the defeat of his enemies.

With  the  help  of  the  devils,  the  Archmage  Arcane  de-

stroyed both Eldeluc and Valkebar (although it is thought that

Eldeluc  had  a  clone  hidden  away).  The  rebel  wizards  loyal

agents also perished that night as Arklem purged the Brother-

hood of all he did not consider loyal to him. When the blood fi-

nally  ceased  to  flow,  Arklem  was  satisfied  that  those  he  had

allowed to survive his fury would be obedient to his commands.

Three of the previous overwizards escaped. Jaluth Snake-

face  Alaerth  (CE  human  female  Wiz20),  a  hot-tempered

woman whose face is cursed to spit forth snakes when she is

angry, fled to the wildlands around Icewind Dale with three

golems. Ornar of the Claw (CE male human Wiz19/Acm3), a

soft-spoken  mage  named  for  some  of  his  unique  spells,  fled

eastward  into  a  stronghold  in  the  Evermoors.  Deltagar  Zel-

hund  (LE  male  human  Wiz18/Lor2/Acm1)  consorts  with

yuan-ti  and  has  gone  into  hiding  in  Hlondeth.  The  fourth,

Eltuth  Wyvernmaster  Oyim,  was  turned  to  stone,  shat-

tered,  restored  to  flesh,  and  then  fed  to  some  of  his  own

charmed pets.

The Archmage Arcane then directed a period of rebuilding,

during which he promoted members into the now-vacant over-

wizard  positions  and  contemplated  the  state  of  the  North.

Honoring his agreement with Nyphithys, he ordered that the

Silver Marches are now the revitalized Brotherhoods primary

target.  Since  then  the  lich  and  his  devilish  companion  have

bent their collective minds and will toward devising the best

means of bringing the fledgling confederation under their con-

trol. Arklem does not truly care why the Silver Marches so in-

terests the erinyes. The young realm is well within the area he

desires to control, and he surmises that its youth may make it

more  vulnerable  than  some  of  the  established  kingdoms  and

cities in the vicinity.

Freed from the specter of a slow, painful death by old age,

Arklem enjoys a new sense of purpose that enables him to con-

centrate completely on claiming the realm that he covets so

dearly.  Indeed,  to  his  fellow  members  in  the  Brotherhood,  it

appears that the process of becoming a lich may have affected

their leaders mind in some fashion, for he now seems in their

eyes  even  more  single-minded  than  before,  perhaps  danger-

ously  so.  His  determination  to  rule  over  the  peoples  of  the

Northeven if it takes him several more lifetimesseems to

be the only thought that burns in his now-undead brain.

Arklems transformation into a lich came too late to repair

the  damage  already  inflicted  on  his  body  by  the  ravages  of

time.  His  frame  is  still  bent,  giving  him  the  appearance  of

frailtybut this appearance belies the unnatural strength of

his now-undead body. Having come into lichdom only recently,

Arklems  skin  has  only  just  started  to  wither  in  earnest.  His

eyes,  however,  have  already  decayed  and  sunk  into  his  head,

leaving  empty  sockets  that  burn  with  pinpoints  of  ghastly

crimson light.

The Overwizards

The Archmage Arcane appoints four overwizards to serve as

his primary agents in both the Host Tower and the organiza-

tion.  Each  overwizard  is  charged  with  the  administration  of

the Brotherhoods interests in one quadrant of Faern match-

ing  the  cardinal  points  of  the  compass.  Each  overwizard  be-

comes  the  master  of  one  of  the  Host  Towers  main  tower

structures  appropriate  to  his  or  her  designation.  Because  the

focus of the Brotherhoods strategic plans is on the North, the

overwizards responsible for the other three quadrants are ex-

pected to devote most of their efforts to gathering informa-

tion that may aid the primary cause and providing support to

the Master of the North Tower in her labors.

The current overwizards are far less likely to plot rebellion

than those who previously held their stations. With the exam-

ples of the recent executions fresh in their minds, the presence

of devils in the Host Tower, and the transformation of their

master into an undead creature of fearsome power, the current

overwizards  are  likely  to  remain  loyal  and  devoted  to  the

Brotherhood.

Overwizard Valindra Shadowmantle (NE female moon elf

Wiz10) was a loyal subordinate in the Host Tower these ten

years past, until the Archmage Arcane promoted her to the

rank of overwizard in the wake of his sudden purge. Born 147

years  ago  in  the  High  Forest,  this  moon  elf  never  felt  the

same respect for community that most elves share. She grew

into  a  self-centered  and  self-absorbed  individual  who  cared

little for anything that wasnt connected to her own goals and

interests. She trained as a wizard but, frustrated with the slow

pace of her education, left her homeland five decades ago to

pursue her own goals. Making her way first to Mirabar, she

had little trouble convincing a trusting old wizard to take on

a winsome young elf as his new apprentice. She spent a year

working  with  her  mentor  before  she  murdered  him  and  ap-

propriated his spellbooks, as well as a number of magic items,

and headed out for Luskan. There she made contact with the

Brotherhood and earned a place among its lesser agents. Since

then she has applied herself to carrying out her assignments

with precision and alacrity, earning a reputation for reliabil-

ity that stood her in good stead when the Archmage Arcane

sought a replacement overwizard. Her reputation among her

former colleagues is less admirable, however. They say Valin-

dra makes use of anyone if she believes doing so advances her

own ambitions.

Valindra  is  now  the  Master  of  the  North  Tower,  and  re-

sponsible  for  administering  the  Brotherhoods  operations  in

this quadrant of Faern. Though she is well pleased that her

111

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/23/01  3:50 PM  Page 112

The Arcane Brotherhood

labors  have  been  recognized,  she  is  not  entirely  comfortable

having a lich as her master. She makes a superior effort not to

allow even the slightest evidence of her unease to show during

her  frequent  audiences  with  the  Archmage  Arcane,  during

which he questions her closely about her memories of the High

Forest and its environs. Valindra suspects, given her masters

deep interest in the Silver Marches, that her birthplace may

have had some effect on her promotion, but now that she has

attained  high  status  she  intends  to  do  whatever  may  be  re-

quired of her to retain it. She is only too willing to bring her

homeland under the Brotherhoods control.

Valindra prides herself on her intellect. She would rather

talk her way out of a fight than blast through opponents with

magic, but she also wont hesitate to maim or kill an enemy if

the  situation  demands  it.  One  of  her  favorite  ploys  when

hiring adventurers is to disguise herself as a moon elf noble,

using  her  intimate  knowledge  of  her  homeland  to  persuade

her minions that she is really a long lost aristocrat in need

of a friend.

Overwizard Rimardo  Domine (LE  male  human  Wiz12/

Acm1) is the jovial Master of the East Tower. Hailing from

Turmish, Rimardo continues to affect the customs and tradi-

tions of the homeland he has not seen in over two decades. He

wears the ornate garb of a Turmish trader and keeps his dark

beard squared in the style popular in his native culture. Visi-

tors to his private chamber are expected to bring him a dish of

fine food as a gift, no matter how many times they may have

called upon him previously. His rooms are decorated with art

treasures from Turmish and scented with the musky incense of

that land.

Rimardo was born and bred in Alaghn, where he gained

his initial training in the Art. The younger of two sons born

to a wealthy merchant, he was apprenticed to a wizard while

his  older  brother  prepared  to  assume  control  of  his  fathers

businesses. Rimardo was content with this arrangement, until

his brother was killed in an earthquake and the burden of be-

coming  his  fathers  mercantile  heir  fell  to  him.  He  did  not

wish to abandon his magical studies. Rimardo left his family

and country behind and went out into the world to pursue his

own interests. He has been a member of the Arcane Brother-

hood for seven years. He took no part in the plot to assassi-

nate the Wizard of Green Fire and enjoys the confidence of

the  Archmage  Arcane.  Currently  Rinardo  is  engaged  in  dis-

cussions,  along  with  High  Captain  Suljack,  with  representa-

tives of the Zhentarim. He believes that the Black Network

may make a strong ally if the Brotherhood wants to keep Wa-

terdeep and Lantan off its back while it concentrates on the

Silver Marches.

Outwardly friendly and genial, Rimardo is interested only

in  taking  what  he  wants  no  matter  who  gets  hurt  in  the

processwithin  the  peculiar  limits  of  his  personal  code  of

ethics. He does not willingly harm children directly, for ex-

ample, nor does he refuse to accept the honest surrender of a

beaten foe. Rimardo truly believes that the Arcane Brother-

hood can govern the North far better than the undisciplined

patchwork of city-states that exists currently, and he labors

tirelessly to bring about the unification of these countries

under his organizations rule. He is certain that the Broth-

erhood  can  transform  the  North  into  Faerns  foremost

economic powerhouse, but he knows that can only happen

when the simpering voices of dissent have been crushed into

silence.

Standing  several  inches  over  6  feet  tall,  Rimardos  well-

muscled form cuts an imposing figure in the Luskan taverns

where he enjoys drinking with several of his subordinates. He

alone among the overwizards is seen regularly in the city, and

most of Luskan considers him by far the least despicable and

fearsome of the Brotherhoods rulers.

Overwizard Arabeth  Raurym (CE  female  human  Rog2/

Sor10)  is  the  oldest  daughter  of  Elastul  Raurym,  the  Mar-

chion  of  Mirabar.  Her  involvement  with  the  Brotherhood

has  been  an  acute  embarrassment  to  her  family  since  she

joined  the  society  nine  years  ago.  News  of  her  elevation  to

the station of overwizard only rubbed salt into their wounds.

For  her  own  part,  she  is  overjoyed  that  her  activities  cause

her family distress and pain. She has loathed them ever since

she was a young child, when it became clear to her that she

would  be  packed  off  to  marry  some  noble  dolt  in  order  to

secure for her family even more lands and wealth (as if they

had any need for an increase in either). At first her parents

saw  her  acts  of  rebellion  as  typical  of  her  age  and  fiery

temperament, but when her activities began to include crim-

inal acts, they grew deeply concerned. She spent considerable

time in the less appealing sections of Mirabar, running with

a gang of young toughs involved in burglary, fencing stolen

goods, and worse.

The High Captains of Luskan

Luskans public face of rulership is a council of five men

known  as  the  High  Captains:  Taerl,  Baram,  Kurth,  Sul-

jack, and Rethnor. This quintet of ex-pirates and freeboot-

ers is ostensibly the top authority in the city, constituting

what  passes  for  government  in  this  rough-and-tumble

port city.

Everyone in Luskan knows that the true power in the

city resides in the Host Tower of the Arcane, and that the

High Captains are merely the pawns of the Arcane Broth-

erhood. That doesnt mean, however, that the populace of

Luskan  openly  defies  the  High  Captains  or  pays  them

only lip service.

Visitors to Luskan often feel acutely unwelcome. Many of

the  local  inns  and  taverns  wont  serve  travelers,  reserving

their rooms and fare for the citys residents, particularly its

sailors and pirates. The Arcane Brotherhood encourages this

unfriendliness, because its masters are suspicious that anyone

entering the city for purposes other than trade may be spies

or enemies. The Brotherhoods agents often follow newcom-

ers discreetly, reporting their movements to the Host Tower.

Arklem and Nyphithys of the Arcane Brotherhood

Her sorcery began to manifest itself when she turned 14,

much  to  her  pleasure.  She  took  great  delight  in  using  her

powers to create disharmony and strife within her household.

When  she  was  16,  her  parents  shipped  her  off  to  a  wizard

cousin  in  Waterdeep,  hoping  that  she  could  do  something  to

tame the wild girl. On the contrary, Arabeths cousin encour-

aged  her  defiance  and  helped  her  young  relative  as  best  she

could to master her growing sorcerous powers. When Arabeth

was 18, her father sent word that she should return home to be

married to a young nobleman her parents had selected for her.

She returned to Mirabar and even went so far as to pretend to

behave herself. On the day of the wedding, she took savage glee

in  wrecking  the  ceremony  with  a  barrage  of  spells.  Fleeing

Mirabar  one  step  ahead  of  the  city  watch  and  her  fathers

hired soldiers, she reached Luskan and made a place for herself

in the lower ranks of the Brotherhood.

As the Master of the South Tower, Arabeths chief concerns

are keeping tabs on what is happening in the southern reaches

of Faern. The Brotherhood has no plans to move against the

lands in that directionat least, not until the North is under

controlso Arabeth is charged with gathering as much infor-

mation  as  possible  about  any  important  developments.  She

pays a large network of informants and rumor-mongers, and

makes at least one trip a year into the southern lands.

The 27-year-old Arabeth is of average height and build. Her

best  feature  is  her  long  mane  of  reddish-brown  hair,  which

grows to her waist. She favors practical clothing with plenty of

storage places for her spell components, and when traveling to

the southern lands she usually adopts garb that reflects the cul-

ture of her destination, to be less conspicuous.

Overwizard Blaskar Lauthlon (NE male human Wiz15) is

the  Master  of  the  West  Tower.  The  overwizard  is  a  middle-

aged man originally from Waterdeep. Blaskar was a member

of  the  Watchful  Order  of  Magists  and  Protectors  until  the

guild discovered that he was stealing rare magical components

from its stores. He was summarily dismissed from the guild.

Unable to practice magic legally in the city, Blaskar sold his

services to any who would pay him. He found work among the

smugglers and thieves of the Dock Ward, and earned a reputa-

tion as a completely amoral spellcaster who didnt shrink from

undertaking even the most despicable job if the coin was right.

The mercenary wizard came to the attention of the Broth-

erhood. A band of smugglers hired Blaskar to defend one of its

ships from pirates as it sailed from Waterdeep to Neverwinter.

Raiders  from  Luskan  attacked  the  ship,  only  to  be  defeated

soundly  by  Blaskars  efforts.  When  the  smugglers  vessel

docked in Neverwinter, the Brotherhoods spies in that town

learned the identity of the ships protector. Soon after, agents

of the Brotherhood approached Blaskar with an offer to join

the organization. Seeing no reason to refuse, Blaskar accepted

and has been a member for the last six years.

Blaskar was not surprised to be given his new rank and title.

He  suspected  that  some  overwizards  reach  would  eventually

exceed  his  grasp,  and  he  planned  for  that  downfallmaking

himself an invaluable part of the Brotherhood by specializing

in the creation of wondrous items. The Archmage Arcane has

given him reason to believe that the Brotherhoods campaign

against the Silver Marches requires a considerable number of

magic devices, and it falls upon Blaskar to create them.

Anyone  meeting  Blaskar  for  the  first  time  would  never

dream that he is a leader in one of the most ruthless arcane

The Arcane Brotherhood

organizations in Faern. He is entirely unremarkable in his ap-

pearance, of average height and build and wearing clothes of

nondescript type. He learned during his days as a mercenary

spellcaster  that  maintaining  a  cultivated  anonymity  often

causes  potential  foes  to  underestimate  him  or  even  overlook

him completely.

The Host Tower of the Arcane

A  sight  that  makes  even  the  bravest  hearts  uneasy,  the  Host

Tower rises above the gray waters of the Luskan harbor like the

gigantic specter of a long-dead tree, its barren limbs stretching

upward toward the overcast sky like the grasping fingers of a

drowning crone. Most experts agree that the structure was cre-

ated magically, but apart from its brief mention in Mirar Saga

there are no clues to its origin. The Host Tower has been the

home of the Arcane Brotherhood since Arklem Greeth first ar-

rived in Luskan over two decades ago. The structure rises into a

central spire surmounted by four more slender spires of equal

height, situated at the cardinal points of the compass. These four

towers bristle with lesser spires, balconies, and branching turrets.

The  Archmage  Arcane  occupies  the  upper  reaches  of  the

central  spire.  The  overwizards  dwell  in  the  four  projecting

towers, each in the spire appropriate to his quadrant of respon-

sibility. Each of the overwizards spires contains private cham-

bers,  laboratories,  storage  space,  summoning  chambers,

libraries,  and  rooms  for  their  apprentices  and  servants.  The

common areas shared by all inhabitants, such as kitchens and

dining rooms, are situated in the central spire where the four

projecting  towers  branch  out.  Only  Arklem  Greeth  and

Nyphithys  know  what  lies  within  the  Archmage  Arcanes

chambers.  Even  the  overwizards  are  not  permitted  to  go

beyond his audience chamber under penalty of death.

Although  the  Host  Tower  boasts  no  obvious  defenses,  the

rumors  surrounding  its  protections  are  as  numerous  as  they

are  wild.  It  seems  as  if  every  pirate,  smuggler,  beggar,  and

sailor  in  Luskan  knows  someone  (usually  the  friend  of  a

friend) who tried to force his way into the place on a bet or a

dare and ended up as a tiny pile of smoldering ashes or some-

thing equally gruesome. So evil is the reputation of the Host

Tower that even the most inebriated and blustery wharf tough

will not conceive of attempting to gain entry without permis-

sion from the residents. Most wont hear of taking visitors out

to the island on which the tower sits, for love or money.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The Arcane Brotherhood intends to control the lands around

its base of operations, beginning with the Sword Coast North,

and  eventually  claim  the  entire  North.  It  already  rules

Luskan, but the overwizards seek to extend their dominion to

all nearby lands and peoples. The Archmage Arcane has been

pursuing this goal for several decades with only a modicum

of success. His groups sway over Luskan is as firm and un-

questioned  as  ever,  but  attempts  to  gain  the  desired  power

elsewhere  have  been  thwarted  time  and  again  by  numerous

obstacles, ranging from the Harpers to the Lords Alliance

to the navies of Waterdeep and Lantan. To date, the endless

NPC Gallery: Artemis Entreri

Artemis Entreri is known throughout Toril as one of the most

deadly assassins in all Faern. (See the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign  Setting for  his  statistics  and  other  information

about him.) Artemis is feared not because he is a master infil-

trator and capable of impersonating any sort of person from

any walk of life to reach his target (which he can do with ease),

but because he doesnt resort to poison or the garrote, common

and cowardly tools of his profession. Instead, Artemis is an ex-

cellent  fighter  and  prefers  to  slay  his  targets  in  direct  con-

frontation. Because of his skill with the sword, he is often hired

to  assassinate  men  and  women  that  are  protected  against

toxins or capable of fighting off a determined attacker. Bar-

barian warlords and paladin generals have fallen to his blade in

a fair fight. Artemis cares nothing for his victims goals, ideals,

families, or place in the world. He is paid to kill, and he does so

efficiently and without emotion.

Artemis can serve many roles in a campaign. If the heroes

become too confident or have greatly angered powerful indi-

viduals  on  the  Sword  Coast,  an  attack  by  him  might  be

enough to put them in their place. If they spend time in the

Underdark, they may find him allied with or in search of a

group of dark elves. If they associate with Drizzt DoUrden

or  his  friends,  Artemis  may  arrive  to  challenge  the  drow.

Morally ambiguous parties might try to hire him to kill one

of  their  powerful  enemies.  Good  groups  might  be  hired  to

capture him, or seek him out to avenge a slain friends death.

As a master swordsman, Artemis is best used in a melee sit-

uation against other fighting characters. He is much less ef-

fective  at  ranged  attacks,  and  spellcasters  are  enough  of  a

wild card that he may avoid fighting them. He is an adept

judge of character and skill, and is quick to determine if his

opponent is capable of doing him great harm. Against a foe

with  whom  he  is  unfamiliar  or  has  not  fought  before,  he

tends to maximize the use of his Expertise feat and his de-

fender dagger, slowly fighting more aggressively as he evalu-

ates his enemys skill. While he prefers an honest fight, he is

not above using dirty tricks if his foe is very powerful or has

assistance. He uses his wounding weapon to slowly bleed his

opponent  into  unconsciousness,  and  is  fond  of  engaging  a

powerful foe for a few rounds, wounding them slightly each

time, then leaving them to bleed a while, only to return later

after their healing magic has been expended. He rarely uses

his prestige classs death attack, preferring the more personal

method of true combat.

Whenever  dealing  with  Artemis,  remember  that  he  is  a

very intelligent man and always leaves himself a means of

escape. At no time does he attack a group of heroes unless he

is  certain  he  can  overcome  them  all.  He  prefers  to  attack

foes one at a time so that there are no distractions and no

witnesses. If faced by opponents that prove to be too power-

ful  or  if  he  is  gravely  injured,  Artemis  attempts  to  escape,

knowing  he  can  always  try  again  when  his  target  is  unpre-

pared.  He  should  carry  at  least  one  magic  item  such  as  a

potion or a tattoo of invisibility to facilitate this escape.

The Arcane Brotherhood

internal  rivalries  have  crippled  nearly  all  its  plans  and

schemes.  In  light  of  recent  events  at  the  Host  Tower,  the

Arcane Brotherhood promises to become a major player in the

political and economic life of the North.

Arklem Greeths ambitions havent diminished with becom-

ing  a  lichif  anything,  quite  the  contrary  is  the  case.  The

Archmage  Arcane  pursues  his  goal  with  a  ruthlessness  and

single-mindedness that borders on obsession.

The  overwizards  have  no  genuine  objections  to  their

masters obsessive behavior, provided that his strategy and tac-

tics  yield  results.  They  share  the  same  ambitions,  after  all.

They  are  understandably  suspicious  of  Nyphithys  and  some-

what  uncomfortable  around  her  and  her  devil  servants,  but

they are willing to tolerate their presence and accept their as-

sistance if it is the will of the Archmage (for now, at least).

The underwizards, apprentices, pirates, brigands, and various

other agents that serve the Arcane Brotherhood are all aware

of  the  organizations  major  goal.  Some  of  these  lesser  func-

tionaries even share it, and hope for a piece of the action when

the North belongs to their masters and employers. Others are

involved purely for the money, and a few claim to be associates

with  the  Brotherhood  purely  for  the  thrill.  The  overwizards

keep their subordinates reasonably well informed with news and

insights that aid them in accomplishing their various tasks, but

the  information  rarely  trickles  down  to  the  lowest  echelons

except by inference. The rank and file are not aware that the

Archmage  Arcane  is  a  lich,  and  most  have  never  even  met

Arklem Greeth (and would prefer to keep it that way).

The erinyes wishes to gain status and promotion by doing

what  comes  naturally  to  her  kind,  and  she  believes  that

Arklem  Greeth  and  his  Brotherhood  are  a  means  to  success.

The greater the Brotherhoods power and influence, the larger

the  number  of  mortals  who  succumb  to  the  corruption  it

spreads, and the greater her rewards promise to be. It was she

who  suggested  to  the  Archmage  that  the  Brotherhood  begin

dealing in the Thayans drugs, a plan designed to weaken the

ability of the Silver Marches to maintain its internal security.

Note: Nyphithys has more Hit Dice than a normal erinyes.

Piracy

For years the Brotherhood has taken advantage of the natu-

rally fierce and proud nature of Luskans seafaring merchants.

Luskan vessels are often not merchant traders at all, but ships

of war carrying orders to harass all shipping using the ports of

Neverwinter  and  Waterdeep  (Luskans  chief  trading  rivals).

The High Captains aid and abet these unsanctioned pirates in

secret,  but  publicly  pretend  that  the  rogues  are  independent

freebooters who act in defiance of Luskans laws. The Brother-

hood sponsors these sea hawks and gives them leave to prey on

ships and ports along the Sword Coast.

The pirates, in addition to relieving luckless merchants of

their  wares  and  coin,  try  to  force  all  shippers  to  use  boats

either  manufactured  in  or  sanctioned  by  Luskan,  and  to  use

the  city  as  their  exclusive  port  of  trade  on  the  Sword  Coast.

These pirates are careful to give a wide berth to those vessels

actually flying the flag of the city of Waterdeep. Past inter-

ventions by the Lords Alliance as well as humiliating military

losses have given the raiders ample cause to shun confronta-

tion with that citys fleet. Likewise, the ships of Amn are al-

lowed  to  go  about  their  business,  unless  the  pirates  are  so

fortunate as to catch a fat Amn trader separated from its es-

corts  by  storm  or  other  misfortune.  Arklem  Greeth  assigns

lower-level  mages  to  various  pirate  ships  so  that  the  raiders

may have the benefit of arcane support for their operations.

Caravan Raids

As if travel in the North wasnt already dangerous enough, the

Brotherhood  also  sponsors  brigands  who  operate  inland.  The

brigands targets in times past included caravans originating in

Mirabar, Longsaddle, Yartar, Neverwinter, and Red Larch. Al-

though these are still viable targets of opportunity, the Broth-

erhood has instructed the raiders to concentrate on merchant

caravans traveling to and from the cities in the Silver Marches.

It is the Brotherhoods intent to make trade with the Marches

difficult for anyone not using Luskan as their starting point.

The brigands work in small but well-armed and highly mobile

groups, outfitted with very good equipment and boasting magi-

cal support in the form of both wondrous items and spellcasters

(either members of the Brotherhood or mercenary mages).

Slavery

Although slavery is not practiced in Luskan by order of the

Brotherhood,  the  trade  in  slaves  is  carried  out  with  relative

openness. Most of the slavers operating in the city do so at the

behest of the Brotherhood, and the mages enjoy a percentage

of the profits raised by this trade. One of the most successful

slave  traders  north  of  Amn,  Inther  Blackfeather  (NE  male

tiefling  Rog8/Wiz4),  resides  in  the  city,  conducting  his  busi-

ness from his favorite curtained booth in the notorious Cutlass

Tavern. Many Luskanites speculate that he too is in the pay of

the Brotherhood, but no direct connection between the two has

been established.

Drugs

At  the  direction  of  the  Archmage  Arcane,  Overwizard  Ri-

mardo  Domine  has  recently  traded  several  newly  researched

spells  to  the  Red  Wizards  for  a  shipment  of  the  Thayans

memory-loss drugs. The Arcane Brotherhood intends to smug-

gle  the  drugs  into  Silverymoon  and  sell  them,  at  cut-rate

prices, to the citizens of the Silver Marches. The Archmage be-

lieves that this will help to destabilize the confederation. The

notion  of  a  drug-addicted  and  dependent  citizenry  in  the

Marches pleases him greatly, particularly if only the Arcane

Brotherhood can supply these customers.

RECRUITING

The Brotherhood has no objections to profit- or power-minded

individuals  seeking  entry  into  its  ranksprovided,  of  course,

that said individuals prove their loyalty and competence by serv-

ing the organization in whatever capacity it may direct. Those

spellcasters who desire membership are thus often overqualified

for the tasks they are initially assigned, but those who demon-

strate skill and obedience can expect promotions in a reasonable

amount of time. The overwizards are free to take on what ap-

prentices they desire, but they become responsible for the con-

duct of their students. A mage who desires membership in the

Brotherhood must eventually meet and pass the scrutiny of the

Archmage  Arcane,  an  audience  that  has  left  more  than  one

Harper spy or independent do-gooder bereft of life and limb.

Naturally  the  organization  employs  nonspellcasters,  for  it

has need of bodyguards, thieves, informants, spies, and servants.

The mages leave the recruitment and outfitting of pirates and

brigands  to  the  High  Captains,  and  it  is  through  this  quintet

that the Brotherhood supplies its raiders with instructions.

Encounters

Most adventurers do not encounter the Archmage Arcane, since

he  almost  never  emerges  from  his  chambers  within  the  Host

Tower. They might encounter Nyphithys either in Luskan, the

Sword Coast North, or even as far east as the Silver Marches,

where  she  sometimes  reconnoiters  the  area  to  keep  tabs  on

what is happening there (the better to keep the Archmage in-

formed). The overwizards might be encountered in Luskan or

while traveling in their respective quadrants of responsibility.

The typical Arcane Brotherhood encounter is with some of

the  groups  sponsored  brigands,  a  hired  spy,  or  underwizards.

The  latter  encounter  normally  consists  of  one  underwizard

leader of at least 5th level, several underwizard assistants, and

a pair of bodyguards (usually fighters, but sometimes barbar-

ians, rangers, or warriors).

Beholders

Fanaxans  eyestalks  whirled  in  delight  as  the  prisoners  were

dragged before it. It bathed them in the invisible rays of its pri-

mary eye, and grunted orders to its grimlock minions to position

the prisoners so that each had but a single eye exposed. Hello,

my flawed children.

The three young beholders cursed and writhed, but could not

escape their tethers or their parents antimagic cone. What do you

want of us, you misshapen parody of a true beholder? asked one.

Yours  is  the  corrupted  form,  Kavalax,  and  you  know  the

fate of those that displease me. It gestured with six of its eye-

stalks toward the alcoves lining the chamber, where the rotting

forms of undead beholders waited, vigilant.

Kavalax couldnt help but shudder.

Beholders are arguably some of the most powerful monsters in

all Faern. Capable of natural flight, gifted with great intelli-

gence, and possessing many magical powers and the ability to

negate  magic,  a  single  beholder  can  destroy  dozens  of  well-

equipped warriors, and under the right circumstances it is all

but invulnerable to the concerted attacks of mages or clerics.

Fortunately  for  other  creatures,  beholders  are  paranoid  and

fight each other as often as they make plans to conquer the

world, so their threat is somewhat limited.

Brief History

The exact origin of the beholders is not known. It is speculated

that they are not native to Faern, having either reached this

place through a portal or from somewhere beyond the Sea of

Night.  Large  numbers  of  beholders  settled  in  the  Calimshan

and Lake of Steam areas, with some managing to seize control

of the country of Calimshan for a time. For the most part, in-

dividual beholders control a few square miles of territory each,

with rare clusters of allied beholders controlling larger areas.

Beholders also inhabit the Underdark, often making lairs near

key passages in order to prey upon adventurers and caravans.

the Organization

Beholders usually operate alone or in small groups with direct

control over all their servants and subjects. The following sta-

tistics are an estimation of the beholder population of Faern

as a whole.

Headquarters: None.

Members: At least 2,000.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: None.

Religion: None. (Beholders have a deity known as the Great

Mother, but their allegiances to each other are not tied to faith.)

Alignment: LE, NE.

Secrecy: Medium or high.

Symbol: The beholders have no common symbol, although a

Beholders battle for dominance

HIERARCHY

At the head of any beholder organization is one or more behold-

ers. With their megalomania and ability to charm other creatures,

beholders prefer to have direct control over their underlings, and

so their organizations tend to have a very flat hierarchy.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

Beholders believe themselves to be supremely intelligent and

powerful, and consider all other beings inferior to themselves.

This  attitude  and  their  powerful  abilities  means  that  a  be-

holders loftiest goal is usually conquest and domination. Some

prefer  outright  aggression,  rallying  weaker  beholders  and

servitor creatures under them to conquer territory by force of

arms.  Others,  such  as  the  beholders  working  with  the  Zhen-

tarim, find allies and gain power by ruthless control of trade

and occasional martial force, and some, such as the Xanathar

of Waterdeep, have a network of spies, assassins, slavers, and

thieves, giving them control of an underground empire.

Most beholders, however, find themselves stymied by a lack

of competent servants and pressured on all sides by other pow-

erful creatures or limited by the environment, and rarely ven-

ture outside their personally created underground lairs. Masters

of all they see but dependent upon their slaves for information

on the outside world, beholders wait and plan for glorious con-

quest, enslaving or destroying any that come to their lair.

RECRUITING

Beholders are always willing to recruit others to their service,

whether  voluntarily  or  through  their  charm  magic.  This

means that nearly any sort of creature that can be charmed

might be a minion of a beholder. Because they consider non-be-

holders unworthy of anything but enslavement, consumption,

or  disintegration,  beholders  treat  their  servants  with  con-

tempt. Their charm magic means that they are rarely short of

minions.  Most  beholders  charm  their  servants  several  times

per day to make sure they remain loyal.

ALLIES

One of the most powerful and totally subservient allies a be-

holder can have is a death tyrant beholder. These creatures are

usually  created  with  the  help  of  a  powerful  cleric  or  mage,

except in the rare cases where the live beholder is actually a

mage  itself.  Quite  often  the  potential  death  tyrant  is  a  slain

rival or one of the beholders own mutant offspring.

Few  beholders  tolerate  other  kinds  of  creatures  having

death tyrant slaves; this is seen as an affront to the entire be-

holder race.

ENEMIES

Beholders have no widespread major enemies except rival be-

holders. Because beholders from different regions tend to have

widely varying appearances, they are unlikely to ever create a

single unified beholder nation because they would constantly

be fighting each other to eliminate their grossly inferior coun-

terparts. A beholder that enters a portal must be very careful,

for if it is transported into the territory of beholders with a

different  appearance,  it  is  very  likely  to  be  quickly  slain  by

those that find its looks abominable.

The Church of Bane

Since  beholders  have  a  high  rate  of  mutation,  a  beholder

that bears young is sometimes confronted with the fact that its

own  offspring  are  abominations  and  must  be  destroyed.  In

some  cases  the  differences  between  parent  and  offspring  do

not  manifest  for  several  months  or  years,  giving  the  young

time to develop their powers and skills and a chance to escape

and survive in the wild. Lone beholders outside a lair are often

of this kind.

The  gouger  beholderkin  are  becoming  more  common  in

and near areas where the phaerimms once held sway. These

creatures, magically bred to fight beholders, are among the

most dangerous foes for beholders. The rumor of a group of

gougers in the area is enough to create a temporary cease-fire

between  rival  beholder  colonies  in  order  to  destroy  the

greater threat.

Encounters

Beholders  are  powerful  opponents,  but  they  prefer  to  spend

their time making plans and reflecting on future glory rather

than bother themselves with eliminating invaders. A beholder

with slaves sends them to fight first, and only if its followers

are being decimated does a beholder feel inclined to intervene.

After  all,  if  its  minions  are  destroyed  by  a  more  powerful

force, it is a simple matter for the beholder to charm the in-

vaders, replacing its older (and obviously inferior) guards with

smarter and more skilled ones.

The Church of Bane

The black-haired mans skin was pale where he wasnt bruised.

His  armor-clad  attendants  half  dragged  him  in  front  of  the

Imperceptor. Surrounding the mans chair were a dozen head-

less corpses, all of which the beaten man recognized as the

bodies of his friends.

Koryn  Bersk,  you  have  been  found  guilty  of

worshiping Cyric in defiance of the will of Bane.

What do you have to say in your defense?

Koryn was silent. His jaw was broken.

Very well. Your punishment is about to be

enacted. The Imperceptor loomed in front of

him,  an  apparition  of  mail  and  black  cloth.

The  mans  gauntleted  finger  stabbed  at  his

chest,  trailing  green  flames.  Koryn  whim-

pered  as  the  flames  seared  the  word

HERETIC  across  his  chest.  The  Imperceptor

stood  back,  and  at  his  nod  the  guards  released  the

prisoner, who collapsed in a low kneel. A moment later,

the mans head was severed and his body fell next to those of

his former companions.

Bring in the next one, ordered the cleric of Bane.

The dread deity Bane is alive again and closing his hand about

Faern.  Banes  return  has  made  an  impression  on  the  good

people  of  Faern,  for  only  now  do  they  realize  how  easy

theyve had it for the past fourteen years, with the evil deities

fighting each other and in some cases enacting purges among

their own ranks. The forces of Bane are marshaled and stand

ready  with  firm  faith  in  their  reborn  deity.  Aided  by  the

Zhentarim  and  dark  magic,  the  Banites  are  a  threat  to  the

safety of all Faern. Because he has always been more appeal-

ing than Cyric or Xvim, Bane is drawing his lost worshipers

back to the fold and gaining converts from the disillusioned

members of other evil faiths.

Brief History

Bane was a scourge upon the world for hundreds of years. Con-

trolling, intelligent, and incredibly evil, his servants were the

source of much misery. When Bane was slain by Torm during

the Time of Troubles, the common folk rejoiced, only to find

his successors, Xvim and Cyric, to be almost as much trouble,

although certainly not as intelligent or competent. Now that

Bane  has  returned,  he  is  showing  the  competence  and  power

that made him a feared name for centuries. Though he battles

with Cyric frequently and still must face his traditional foes,

the  Black  Hand  is  confident  and  plans  to  lead  his  church  in

conquest of all Faern.

the Organization

The church of Bane is well organized, well equipped, and popu-

lated  by  people  who  understand  the  need  for  order  and  enjoy

hurting those weaker than they. This combination of qualities

makes  the  church  of  Bane  a  more  credible  threat  than  the

church of Cyric, despite the Dark Suns greater numbers and his

worshipers  willingness  to  sacrifice  themselves  in  a  frenzy  of

killing.

These statistics refer to the church of Bane as a whole.

Headquarters: Zhentil Keep, the Moonsea.

Members: Roughly 8,000 clergy and 135,000 worshipers.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: Fzoul Chembryl, Chosen of Bane.

Religion: Bane.

Alignment: LE, NE, LN.

Secrecy: Low.

Symbol:  Banes  symbol  has  undergone

changes since his rebirth. While it once was an

upright black hand on a red shield, some ele-

ments of Xvims symbol (green glowing eyes

in darkness or on a black hand) have been re-

tained, and Banes church now rallies behind

a black fist with beams of green light being

pressed from it.

HIERARCHY

As  both  a  lawful  entity  and  the  deity  of  tyranny,

Bane expects a well-defined structure for his church and

compliance in all given orders. The head of the church is Fzoul

Chembryl, who has absolute authority over all other members

of the church. Headquartered in Zhentil Keep, the church is or-

ganized like a military unit, with each temple having a clear

chain  of  command  and  the  temple  leaders  (called  Impercep-

tors)  reporting  to  a  senior  cleric  of  a  region,  who  reports  to

Fzoul or one of his direct underlings.

Most of the important members of the church of Bane are

described in the Zhentarim section of this book.

Banes Temple of the Black Gauntlet

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The churchs goals are simpleconvert all to the worship of

Bane,  and  destroy  those  who  do  not  convert.  It  is  presumed

that  some  exceptions  would  be  made  for  servants  of  allied

deities  (such  as  Loviatar,  Malar,  Mask,  and  Talona).  In  the

meantime,  people  should  be  made  to  fear  Bane  so  that  they

invoke his name in fear and to ward him off, which gives him

some small power.

The church of Bane uses force and persuasion to control

territory,  whether  by  marching  armies  against  reticent

towns  or  by  bribing  bored  nobles  with  slaves,  riches,  and

offers  of  power.  With  its  close  ties  to  the  Zhentarim,  the

church has been able to focus on the subtler methods of con-

version, leaving the more direct methods to the Black Net-

work.

RECRUITING

Given that it wishes to convert everyone to worshiping Bane,

the church is very open to new recruits. Anyone can swear loy-

alty to Bane and join the church. However, the church expects

loyalty and is not stupid, so it performs alignment checks on

new recruits (with detect chaos and detect good) to see if they

are fakers or potential saboteurs. Even those with alignment

differences are given the opportunity to convert (often with

an atonement spell), for Bane recognizes the value of those who

have seen the lure of good and turned away from it to serve

evil (one of his most powerful servants is a blackguard of this

type, after all).

ALLIES

Followers of Bane can sometimes enlist the aid of his servitor

deities Loviatar, Malar, Mask, and Talona, although their al-

liance  is  more  a  pact  of  mutual  nonaggression  than  true

friendship. The greatest ally of the Banites is the Zhentarim,

and  all  followers  of  Bane  are  being  taught  how  to  recognize

Zhentarim safe-markings and the proper countersigns to give

to an agent of the Black Network.

ENEMIES

Because it wishes to subvert and destroy all other faiths, the

church  of  Bane  is  opposed  by  nearly  every  other  church  in

Faern (some of the weaker deities hope that by serving him,

they may survive). The rivalries with the churches of Helm, Il-

mater, Lathander, Mystra, Oghma, Torm, and Tyr are partic-

ularly strong, and Banite clerics take great pains to kill clerics

of these faiths in gruesome ways, leaving them to be discov-

ered by unsuspecting innocents.

Cyric is Banes greatest divine foe, for the Dark Sun wishes

to reclaim the portions of his portfolio taken by Xvim, which

were then passed to the new Bane. Bane has similar feelings for

Cyric, and would love to crush the upstart under his heel, seiz-

ing his lost portfolios in return. Banites enjoy branding Cyri-

cist corpses and altars with the word heretic as a warning to

other followers of the Dark Sun.

The Banites are also opposed by the Harpers, the Lords Al-

liance,  the  Emerald  Enclave,  and  other  groups  that  respect

local  governments  and  the  freedom  of  people  to  make  deci-

sions about their lives.

The Church of Bane

Encounters

In combat situations, the faithful of Bane are trained to follow

orders from the clerics. In turn, the clerics are expected to react

intelligently  in  combat,  give  precise  orders,  and  have  those

orders carried out. Clerics of Bane try to maximize the use of

flanking, cover, and the strengths of their troops, using their

spells to increase their own abilities or directly attack their ene-

mies. Banite clerics tend to rely upon wands and potions to heal

their allies, since they dislike preparing cure spells in favor of

attack magic. Rarely do they use defensive spells, seeing this as

a weak-willed usage of Banes gifts. Defensive magic items, how-

ever, are acceptable and common.

Bane  and  Xvim  have  provided  their  clergy  with  several

unique spells, and Bane continues to grant these spells to his

worshipers,  even  though  some  of  them  have  spread  to  other

faiths. These spells are battletide, mystic lash, and stone walk.

Since his return, many of his faith have been using a weapon

they call a Banesword, and these blades are becoming as recog-

nizable as Banes own symbol.

RITUALS

The  church  of  the  Black  Hand  knows  many  dark  rites  that

grant the devout recipient powers or immunities in exchange

for sacrifices. Each ritual takes several hours of prayer and re-

quires  the  intervention  of  two  clerics  of  Bane,  one  of  whom

must be at least 7th level.

Ritual of Terrors Allegiance: This ritual cements the recip-

ients loyalties to Bane, reducing the chance that they might be

controlled  by  another  being.  The  target  gains  a  +4  morale

bonus  on  Will  saving  throws  against  fear  and  a  +2  morale

bonus on all other mind-affecting effects. The ritual requires a

black star sapphire worth 1,000 gp or more as a material com-

ponent and drains 800 XP from the recipient.

The Rite of Dread Presence: The recipient gains the ability

to use a fear spell once per day as a supernatural ability. The

caster level is 7th, and the DC is 14 + the recipients Charisma

modifier. The ritual drains 2,000 XP from the recipient.

Temple of the

Black Gauntlet

When an evil church needs to assemble a small army of fanatics,

often the best way to do it is find a location out of the eye of civ-

ilization,  build  a  fort  there,  and  garrison  troops  and  clerics,

slowly building up the defenses until it is a fully operational fa-

cility with hundreds of faithful. The Temple of the Black Gaunt-

let is one such place in the early stages of its development. With

a little over fifty residents, the temple is a sparsely populated

building without a defensive wall or any support buildings. The

population is low enough that the residents can survive by hunt-

ing  and  foraging,  supplemented  with  occasional  supplies  pur-

chased from a nearby settlement and food conjured by the clerics.

The Temple of the Black Gauntlet can be placed in almost any

location that is at least a days march from the nearest road. Its

existence is not known to people living in local settlements. If left

unchecked, the temple may become the center of a new Banite-

controlled area, with the servants of the Black Hand demanding

tribute from nearby villages and making raids on enemy temples.

TEMPLE LAYOUT

The temple is made of stone, most of it conjured with wall of

stone spells. Currently, no space within the temple is devoted to

preparing food, so this task is handled in small tents or in the

open air outside. As the temple grows, other buildings are to be

added to support secondary functions such as a kitchen, black-

smith, and so on. Patrols in this area are frequent but small,

with four guards being the standard size.

Unless otherwise noted, all doors in the temple are simple

wooden doors (break DC 13) with average locks (Open Lock

DC 25). Interior doors that do not lead to bedrooms are usu-

ally  unlocked.  Exterior  doors  are  strong  wooden  doors  with

good-quality locks and are kept locked.

1. Entryway

Two guards are on duty in this room, preventing unauthorized

access. They challenge anyone they dont recognize. The walls

are decorated with tapestries depicting Banes power. Murder

holes  in  the  ceiling  lead  to  the  roof  level,  which  means  this

room  leaks  when  it  rains  (nothing  is  currently  stockpiled  to

utilize these murder holes).

2. Guardroom

This room is currently the quarters of eight guards, although it

could hold up to three times that number. Each guard has a

bunk bed and a storage locker.

3. Minor Clerics

This is the sleeping room of four 1st-level clerics of Bane. Each

has a bed, small table, chair, and storage locker.

4. Storage

This  area  is  laden  with  crates,  normal  weapons,  dried  goods,

tools,  and  other  items  essential  for  the  maintenance  and

growth  of  an  armed  group  of  cultists.  The  trapdoor  in  the

floor is kept clear of materials to allow easy access to the dun-

geon level.

5. Sacred Chamber

This chamber has a large raised dais in the center, bearing a

symbol of Bane inlaid on the top of the dais with colored tiles.

6. Lesser Clerics

This is the sleeping room of two 3rd-level clerics of Bane. Each

has a bed, small table, chair, and storage locker.

7. Clerics

This is the sleeping room of two 5th-level clerics of Bane. Each

has a bed, small table, chair, and storage locker. Both lockers

are  protected  by  a  glyph  of  warding (inflict  serious  wounds,

3d8+5, Search DC 28).

8. Greater Cleric

This is the sleeping room of a 7th-level cleric of Bane. The room

has a bed, table, two chairs, and sturdy chest. The chest is protected

by a glyph of warding (blast glyph, 4d8 cold, Search DC 28).

9. High Cleric

This is the sleeping room of a 9th-level cleric of Bane. The room

has a bed, table, two chair, sturdy chest, and wardrobe. The chest

The Church of Shar

is protected by a glyph of warding (blast glyph, 5d8 cold, Search

DC 28).

10. Dungeon Level Entrance

When the temple is holding prisoners, a guard is kept on duty here.

11. Cells

These are typical dungeon cells, with a locked door (Open Lock

DC 30), straw on the floor, and a place where manacles can be

attached. At this time, the temple has no prisoners.

12. Additional Storage

More  boxes,  barrels,  and  crates  are  stacked  here,  containing

items  that  are  used  less  frequently  or  wont  be  needed  until

more people move into the temple (more cookware, additional

uniforms, and so on).

13. Interrogation Room

This  room  has  a  large  table  and  some  simple  torture  instru-

ments. Because the temple hasnt needed to torture anyone yet,

this room is unused.

Roof

The  roof  can  be  accessed  by  the  four  ladders  near  area  5  or

through  the  secret  doors  in  the  eastern  towers.  Eventually

some ballistae will be mounted here, but until then the parapet

wall can be used to provide one-half cover for guards standing

behind it and firing upon targets on the ground. Other plans

are  to  build  ladders  on  the  towers  to  allow  guards  to  stand

watch or make ranged attacks from a higher elevation.

The Church of Shar

Lady  of  Loss,  favor  me  now.  Zahrena,  priestess  of  Shar,

spoke  aloud  in  the  near  total  darkness  that  threatened  to

smother the dim light from her small brazier. The guttering

flame  barely  illuminated  the  supine  body  of  the  unconscious

gnoll  laid  carefully  on  the  altar  rock,  awaiting  its  fate.  The

dull  orange  glow  reflected  dimly  off  the  metal  studs  in  the

clerics leather armor, now stained with the dirt and grime of

the road. It had taken her hours to reach this hidden place with

her unconscious burden, but now she was nearing the end of the

ceremony that would win her Shars favor.

Mistress of the Dark, favor me now. The priestess drew

from her belt the favored weapon of her deity, a razor-sharp

chakram.  Holding  it  in  one  hand,  she  extended  her  other

toward the roof of the cavern and, splaying her fingers wide,

begged Shar to take notice of the blood sacrifice. If the deity

was  pleased,  she  would  grant  Zahrena  the  divine  spells  she

craved. She would in turn use these powers to further Shars

goals here in Faern. If the deity was not pleased . . . she pre-

ferred not to think about that. Raising the chakram above her

victim, she concluded her invocation.

Dark Deity, favor me now. Slowly, carefully, she brought

the chakram down.

The deity Shar is one of the reasons why good folk in Faern

fear the night. The clergy of Shar fulfills the commands of

Selnes dark twin, whose sinister desires and schemes are the

stuff  of  evil  legend.  Dedicated  to  spreading  her  dogma  and

The Church of Shar

carrying out her wishes, the church of Shar is of necessity a se-

cretive and furtive organization that must practice its rites in

hidden places, for the faith is forbidden in some areas. A con-

siderable number of those who follow the Lady of Loss are

quite  willing  to  give  up  their  own  lives  if  doing  so  better

serves  the  Dark  Deity,  making  this  organization  a  particu-

larly deadly and dangerous foe of those who espouse the doc-

trines  of  Shars  enemies.  Any  good-hearted  person  fears  the

snares and lies of Shar, and rightly so.

Perhaps  because  times  have  been  increasingly  difficult

across Faern in recent years, giving rise to greater feelings of

jealousy, hatred, and bitterness, Shars cult has of late gained a

number of converts, and with them an increase in its influ-

ence and resources. Though barred officially from some cities,

hidden temples consecrated to the Mistress of the Night have

sprung up across Faern. From these secret bases the churchs

cells  advance  the  power  of  their  sect  even  as  they  advance

their own.

Brief History

Shar is, was, and shall always be. So say her priests, and they

may well be correct. Her own history dates back to the very

earliest  origins  of  the  cosmos.  Dark  Shar  and  her  bright

sister, Selne, together brought about the creation of the uni-

verse in which Toril is found. But their opposed nature led

to  strife  and  finally  to  open  conflict.  In  the  divine

struggle  that  ensued,  Selne  emerged  victorious

through the aid of the newborn deity Mystryl

(later  Mystra),  born  of  energy  taken  from

both  sisters.  Ever  since  that  time,  Shar  has

struggled  against  her  lighter  twin.  Powerful

but isolated, she waxed and waned in power as

the eons passed.

Mortals have worshiped the various aspects

of Shar since they first appeared in the world.

She  is  favored  by  those  whose  desires  and  deeds

are best served by darkness, venerated by those who

have suffered loss and grown bitter in its wake, and wor-

shiped by those whose hearts are filled with jealousy. All who

know the delicious thrill of discovering and hoarding secrets,

particularly  those  of  a  malicious  or  spiteful  nature,  know

Shars caress. Her dogma of hopelessness in the face of an un-

caring and indifferent cosmos appeals to all those for whom

life seems without meaning or substance. During the Time of

Troubles, she acquired the Cavern portfolio by slaying Ibran-

dul,  a  lesser  power.  Since  then  a  number  of  subterranean

beings, such as goblins, troglodytes, and kobolds, have started

to venerate her.

Today  Shars  clergy  is  actively  spreading  her  worship

throughout Faern. The clerics must do their work in secret,

however, for Shar has many enemies. Her clerics tools include

subversion, corruption, and outright deception as they work to

convert  the  faithful  of  other  deities  to  the  worship  of  the

Lady of Loss.

The Organization

Headquarters: Because the cult must remain hidden to avoid

persecution, it has no official center of worship or administra-

tion that would tempt its enemies. Its largest religious house is

the Temple of Old Night in Calimport.

Members: It is impossible to know the exact number of wor-

shipers who consider Shar their patron deity, or who venerate

her sufficiently to be considered active in her church. The best

estimate is that perhaps as many as 100,000 Faernians have

chosen Shar as their patron, and of this number some 3,500

represent her as clergy.

Hierarchy: Webbed.

Leader: Shar.

Religion: Shar.

Alignment: NE, LE, CE.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: Shars  symbol  is  a  pure  black  disk  with  a  deep

purple  border.  This  symbol  is  displayed  prominently  in  her

temples and shrines (though in some hidden worship areas the

symbol  is  removed  between  services,  so  that  intruders  who

stumble upon the place of worship will not necessarily know

exactly what is transpiring there). Her clerics often wear jew-

elry that bears her sigil worked into its designs. They prefer jet

or onyx for the black center of the symbol, and amethyst or

purple marble for the border.

The church of Shar is segmented into a number of individ-

ual  cells  that  operate  independently.  A  cell  is  nor-

mally  organized  near  a  temple,  shrine,  or  other

place  of  worship.  All  the  cells  in  a  given  geo-

graphic  area  are  under  the  command  of  a

single priest. These priests communicate with

one another, but they provide information to

their  inferiors  only  on  a  need-to-know  basis.

Shar  is,  after  all,  the  deity  of  unrevealed  se-

crets. Whether or not she actually lies to her

clergy is uncertain, but it seems likely that Shar

never reveals more than she feels she must, even

to those who serve her well.

HIERARCHY

Shars  temples  are  controlled  and  administered  by  the  most

senior (that is, the most potent) cleric of Shar. Each temples

hierarchy is unique, but regardless of its precise organizational

structure it is always arranged in a clearly defined manner. All

members of the clergy know their place, and church doctrine

forbids attempting to improve ones position . . . although this

rule is conveniently ignored by the ambitious.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  church  of  Shar  exists  both  to  perpetuate  itself  and  to

spread  the  influence  of  the  Dark  Deity  by  converting  wor-

shipers to her faith. Shars worshipers advance these goals by

working secretly to undermine and corrupt governments, reli-

gions,  and  persons  dedicated  to  good  or  tenets  that  differ

from their own. Doing so makes their victims more receptive

to  Shars  gospel  and  increases  the  likelihood  that  they  will

turn away from their own faiths and accept hers. While their

methods  may  seem  similar  to  those  of  other  evil  organiza-

tions, each member of the church of Shar performs these acts

not merely for personal gain but from a deep devotion to the

122

The Church of Shar

Lady  of  Loss  and  an  unwavering  obedience  to  her  worldly

representatives.

Any  given  cell  of  the  church  may  undertake  a  variety  of

clandestine operations, as dictated by its superiors. Often, the

members of a cell do not know exactly why they are to murder

a particular noble or take over a certain merchants business.

Those who absolutely need to know hold these secrets in trust.

Among the clergy, secrets are the coin of the realm. They are

the  most  valuable  commodities  available  to  a  worshiper  of

Shar, and they are not distributed casually. Sharrans offering

to share information expect a return in kind.

Secrets are also useful for subverting the minds and wills

of  potential  converts.  A  well-placed  secret  in  the  right  ear

may gain a new soul for Shar much faster and more lastingly

than a conversion obtained at swordpoint. A favorite recent

example  involves  a  certain  notable  countess  in  Sembia,  who

was  ignorant  of  the  fact  that  her  beloved  husband  was  en-

gaged  in  an  affair  with  her  sister  .  .  .  until  a  priest  of  Shar

whispered  the  awful  secret  in  her  ear.  The  countess  experi-

enced all the emotions that made her receptive to Shars mes-

sageloss,  jealousy,  and  bitterness.  The  countesss  thirst  for

revenge for this slight drove her right into the waiting arms

of the church of Shar. So does the influence of the Dark Deity

grow, one soul at a time.

Although the church of Shar normally avoids open conflict

with other religions, it is intractably opposed to the agents of

good  faiths,  particularly  those  of  Selne.  So  bitter  is  Shars

hatred  for  her  twin  that  much  of  her  clergys  resources  and

energy  are  devoted  to  bringing  as  much  hurt  to  the  Moon-

maiden  as  possible.  A  cell  suspends  all  other  activities  if  it

learns of an opportunity to combat the forces of Selne.

The church works on occasion with the monks of the Dark

Moon, an elite order of sorcerer-monks who serve the Lady of

Loss.  But  these  collaborations  are  infrequent,  since  Shar

prefers that the monks operate independently (see Monks of

the Dark Moon, later in this book).

RECRUITING

Shars  church  actively  recruits  new  members  as  well  as  wor-

shipers of its deity. But Shars priests are not easily fooled, and

those wishing to be ordained in her church must undergo tests

of faith and commitment that involve practices abhorrent to

most  good-aligned  beings.  Those  who  balk  at  committing

murder or sacrificing a loved one to prove themselves are not

accepted into the clergy. Often they are themselves killed, usu-

ally by a potential true convert who is ready to show his devo-

tion to the faith. New cleric recruits are continually tested, as-

signed to activities that require uncompromising obedience to

the church hierarchy and principles. The hands of most initi-

ates are so steeped in blood after only a few months as mem-

bers  of  the  clergy  that  even  if  they  were  to  renounce  their

faith and somehow escape Shars vengeance, they would very

likely never be welcomed again in good societies.

Once accepted into the clergy, a cleric of Shar must demon-

strate  unswerving  and  unquestioning  obedience  to  his  or  her

superiors. To defy orders is to invite death. Seldom are her cler-

ics given instructions that involve suicidal sacrifice, for Shar

does not spend her worshipers lives unless doing so leads to a

future  net  gain  of  converts.  Those  who  serve  the  faith  well

learn its secrets, but not before they are judged ready.

Folk who choose Shar as their patron deity because circum-

stances in their lives led them to believe in her message gener-

ally have no problem finding their way to the nearest under-

ground cell. Joining Shars church as a worshiper, rather than

as a member of her clergy, also involves performing acts that

would  revulse  nonevil  individuals.  Those  who  betray  the

church  after  being  exposed  to  or  participating  in  these  rites

are, naturally, destroyed.

The Church and the Shadow Weave

The FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting details the ori-

gins of the Shadow Weave and the effects on characters who

learn  to  harness  its  power.  The  Sharran  church  naturally

makes use of the Shadow Weave, though not universally. The

secrets of the Shadow Weave are among the Sharrans most

closely guarded secrets. The Lady of Loss has retained many

of the Shadow Weaves most potent aspects for herself, and

she doles out its lesser capabilities to those among her faith-

ful whom she deems worthy.

From time to time, Shar imparts to her priests her desire

to eliminate a particular spellcaster who is using the Shadow

Weave. The victims of her animosity are not normally wiz-

ards  or  sorcerers  who  have  stumbled  onto  information

about  the  Shadow  Weave  unintentionally,  but  those  who

have learned to access it through research or trial and error.

Many of these spellcasters do not use their Shadow Weave

talents in a way that is pleasing to Shar. Some of them, hor-

rified at what they have discovered, actually have the temer-

ity  to  attempt  to  restore  their  magic  to  its  normal,

Weave-using status. Sharran clerics also sometimes ask their

deity if a particular individual using the Shadow Weave meets

with her approval, to which the deity responds that until she

indicates that she desires that persons death, her priests are to

ignore  his  activities.  Aeron  Morieth  (N  male  half-elf

Wiz13/Sha3) of Chessenta is one such mage, and though the

Sharrans  keep  a  close  watch  on  his  activities,  Shar  has  ex-

pressly forbidden her worshipers to approach him in any way.

A small faction of Sharran clergy advocates the elimina-

tion  of  any  being  that  acquired  knowledge  of  the  Shadow

Weave through any means other than becoming a member

of  Shars  church.  The  members  of  this  faction  view  those

wizards and sorcerers who stumble on Shadow Weave infor-

mation accidentally as threats to the churchs security. Who

knows,  they  reason,  to  whom  these  blundering  dolts  might

impart these deep secrets? Some representatives of this fac-

tion have recently taken to hiring unscrupulous adventurers

to destroy such individuals under the pretense of some other

crime or slight. Shar herself unquestionably is aware of this

faction and its activities, but to date she has not taken steps

to rein them in.

123

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/23/01  6:17 PM  Page 124

The Church of Shar

Shars followers are expected to increase her influence and

power by bringing more worshipers into the fold. Her clerics

actually  do  not  provide  the  majority  of  converts  to  Shars

faith. Most conversions are accomplished by family or friends,

who convince a new devotee to join the church. More than a

few converts are persons who have suffered such terrible loss

or bitter grief that they desire only to forget, and in so doing

they  find  themselves  drawn  irresistibly  to  Shars  message  of

soothing  hopelessness.  Little  do  they  suspect  that  someone

close to them orchestrated their woes, in order to gain another

soul for Shar.

ALLIES

Given Shars dogma, its not difficult to understand why her

church has few lasting allies. The Dark Deitys unforgiving

and  bleak  dogma  discourages  alliances  of  all  but  the  most

temporary  sort.  Those  who  willingly  work  alongside  Shars

clergy do so with the knowledge that the Sharrans will never

reveal  any  profound  secrets  or  vital  information  except

under the most extraordinary circumstances. The church has

no hesitation about employing monsters or creatures that are

easily bribed, manipulated, or intimidated into serving Shars

goals.  Undead,  evil  humanoids,  and  ambitious  young  evil

dragons are common among the churchs servitors and casual

associates.

Among the Faernian deities, only Talona does not fear to

ally herself regularly with Shar, but she does so only when the

partnership  brings  woe  to  their  common  enemy,  Loviatar.

Shar  has  been  observing  Cyrics  career  since  his  ascension  to

godhood during the Time of Troubles. Of late she has begun to

tempt him with the power of the Shadow Weave, which would

allow his clerics to free themselves from their dependence on

Mystra. She has not yet revealed the extent of her plans for a

SharranCyricist alliance even to her most loyal clerics, how-

ever, since she does not wish those forces allied to her hated

sister to become aware of what might well become the most

powerful evil cult in Faern.

ENEMIES

Shars foes include all the organized groups, clergies, and forces

of  good.  First  among  her  opponents  is,  of  course,  her  sister

Selne. Shars hatred and loathing for the Moonmaiden is un-

remitting,  and  her  clergy  has  standing  orders  to  destroy  her

sisters worshipers whenever possible. Shar takes special delight

in condemning captured Selnite clerics to prolonged and ex-

cruciating torture.

Encounters

Adventurers  most  often  encounter  small  groups  of  Shars

clergy  going  about  their  deitys  business:  carrying  messages

from  one  cell  to  another,  working  to  undermine  or  topple

some  local  government,  plotting  against  the  church  of

Selne, or engaged in other activities designed to increase the

power of Shar. Lone members of the church travel through-

out Faern on missions of espionage or murder. Because they

do not wish to draw attention to themselves in areas where

their faith is prohibited or persecuted, Sharrans often travel

disguised  as  merchants,  pilgrims,  or  even  adventurers.  In

lands where Shar is worshiped openly and her temples have

gained influence, the Sharrans make no such compromises.

A typical Sharran encounter includes a cleric leader of at

least  2nd  level,  plus  some  muscle.  If  the  clerics  encountered

are of sufficiently high level, they are likely to also have some

levels of the divine disciple or divine champion prestige classes.

Mages who are members of the church often accompany these

operatives. Some clerics of Shar multiclass as rogues, and spell-

casters who access the Shadow Weave are common among the

leaders in these group encounters.

Following is a description of a cleric of Shar who has also ac-

quired several levels in the shadow adept prestige class (see the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Setting).  A  character  of  this

sort is most likely to be encountered in the vicinity of a Shar-

ran temple, but may be found almost anywhere if a potential

convert is located nearby.

Esvele is a slender woman of medium height whose appearance

marks  her  as  a  native  Chondathan:  She  has  tawny  skin  and

curly, deep brown hair that falls unfettered to her waist, and

eyes the color of amber. Though she left her home early in life,

she spent enough time there to capture the Chondathan man-

nerism of serenity, displaying only those emotions on her face

that she wishes others to see.

Her parents were once successful merchants who were sud-

denly  impoverished  by  some  unwise  trade  speculations  when

she was about 13 years of age. Nearly destitute, they were res-

cued from poverty by the unexpected appearance of Sharran

clergy at their door. The partys leader offered the pair a hand-

some  sum  in  gold  in  exchange  for  their  middle  daughter,

Esvele, and the bargain was struck without undue hesitation.

Since then, Esvele has been raised in the church of Shar and

has  become  one  of  its  fast-rising  stars.  She  believes  in  her

deitys teachings and dogma without reservation, and does her

utmost  to  be  an  exemplary  worshiper  of  the  Lady  of  Loss.

Today she is assigned to a secret Sharran temple in Urmlaspyr,

where she uses her attractive features and natural gift for in-

trigue to increase the cults numbers among the wealthy and

jaded Sembian merchant class.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

The worship of Shar does not grant any spell-like or supernat-

ural abilities by default, although the church knows of several

rituals that grant permanent powers to the devout in exchange

for personal and monetary sacrifices. A ritual typically takes

several hours and requires the intervention of a cleric of Shar

of 9th level or higher.

The  Ritual  of  the  Shadowmantle: The  recipient  of  this

ritual  gains  the  ability  to  surround  herself  with  a  cloak  of

flickering,  undulating  shadows  that  she  can  shape  into  a

frightening mantle. She can invoke this power once per day,

with a duration of 1 minute. The recipient gains a +2 circum-

stance  bonus  on  all  Intimidate  checks  and  a  +1  deflection

bonus to Armor Class. While surrounded by the mantle, the re-

cipient also gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a +3

saving throw bonus against any holy, good, or light spells or ef-

fects. Sharran clergy typically utilize this ritual as a means of

displaying their power, and to frighten or cow their enemies.

The recipient must surrender 500 XP and offer a black sap-

phire worth at least 2,000 gp to Shar.

The Ritual of Shadow Walking: This ritual bestows upon the

recipient the ability to use shadows as a means of conveyance.

The recipient may enter an area of shadow as a standard action

and  emerge  immediately  from  another  such  area  that  is  no

more than 100 feet away. This power is a supernatural ability

that  the  recipient  can  invoke  at  will.  By  utilizing  the  rituals

Sharran ceremony and sacrifice

125

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/23/01  6:19 PM  Page 126

The Daemonfey

power  repeatedly,  the  recipient  can  effectively  step  through

shadows to reach a distant location. Most recipients utilize the

ritual as a means of escape or ambush.

The journey through the numbingly cold shadowstuff takes

a toll on the ritual users health: Each time she invokes this

power, she suffers 2 points of temporary Constitution damage

and  a  loss  of  2d4  hit  points.  The  ritual  user  may  also  hide

within the shadowstuff, rather than emerging, but the cost for

doing so is even higher: For every round the recipient does not

emerge from the area of shadow, she suffers 4 points of tem-

porary  Constitution  damage  and  a  loss  of  3d4  hit  points.

The Daemonfey

The only sound in the dimly lit stone chamber was the eerie res-

onance  of  Saryas  long,  talonlike  fingernail  scraping  over  the

naked bone of the skull she hefted before her. The whiteness of

the polished bone contrasted well against the red hue of her skin,

and her batlike wings fluttered as she contemplated her victory.

The  half-fiend  scraped  her  nail  once  more  over  the  bleached

surface  of  the  skull,  and  this  time  she  smiled  as  the  sound

bounced and played off the cold stone.

The  trophy  had  belonged  to  an  enemy,  and  it  was  over  his

defeat that she was gloating. Baron Ryvvik had thought to usurp

his mothers place at the head of their clan, but Saryas foolish

child had underestimated both her knowledge of his plans and

her  ruthlessness.  If  mother  could  only  be  here,  Sarya  thought,

she would be so pleased.

The  daemonfey  collectively  comprise  a  clan  of  evil,

magically  talented  half-fiends  and  feyri  (tieflings  de-

scended  from  elf-demon  crossbreeds)  that  has  been

recently freed from centuries of imprisonment to

stalk  Faern  once  again.  These  folk  are  true

monsters: ambitious, cruel, proud, and utterly

unconcerned with anything apart from their

own  selfish  desires.  The  daemonfey  are  at

their core a small group of hate-filled indi-

viduals who live to exact revenge on those

who  thwarted  their  plans  and  sealed  them

off from the world so long ago. The daemon-

fey are a hidden but imminent threat to the

peoples and communities of the North while

they  plot  to  punish  the  elven  race  for  having

the effrontery to imprison them.

Brief History

The original daemonfey were members of House Dlardrageth,

proud  but  politically  ambitious  families  of  sun  elves  who

dwelled nearly six thousand years ago in the area that would

one day become known as Cormanthor. The members of the

house trafficked with demons as a means of gaining power, and

they  believed  that  they  could  strengthen  their  bloodline  by

mingling  it  with  the  infernal.  The  children  born  of  such

unions were indeed powerful, and became skilled sorcerers as

well. When their fellow elves learned of these horrifying activ-

ities,  they  destroyed  House  Dlardrageth.  A  few  survivors  es-

caped and fled into hiding.

Centuries later elven mages discovered the remaining half-

fiends,  who  fought  desperately  to  save  themselves  but  could

not prevail against the forces arrayed against them. The mages

imprisoned the handful of survivors of this assault in a magi-

cal  prison  that  confined  them  for  millennia.  While  they  re-

mained in a state of near-slumber, a few lesser sun elf houses

decided to follow House Dlardrageths example. Their children

were likewise set upon by outraged elves and either killed or

imprisoned by elven mages.

The  destruction  of  Hellgate  Keep  in  1369  DR  freed  the

original members of House Dlardrageth from their centuries-

old  prisons.  They  in  turn  freed  the  descendants  of  the  lesser

houses, who had interbred with succubi and incubi to create a

race of sun elf tieflings known as feyri, and adopted them into

House Dlardrageth.

The Organization

Headquarters: A subterranean lair in the North located be-

neath the ruins of Lothen of the Silver Spires, near the dwar-

ven ruin known as the Hall of Four Ghosts.

Members: 52 (2 half-fiends, 33 feyri, 9 servants, and 8 in-

dividual associates).

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: Countess Sarya Dlardrageth.

Religion: The  daemonfey  do  not  worship  the  deities  of

Faern.  They  venerate  their  namesakes  (the  demon  elves  of

House  Dlardrageth)  and  pay  homage  to  certain  infernal

powers.

Alignment: CE.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: As the rightful heirs of House Dlardrageth,

the daemonfey feel free to use a stylized version of

that  familys  ancient  crest.  The  house  is  now

known by a scarlet phoenix with the sable, bat-

like  wings  of  a  demon,  and  a  burning  whip

clutched  in  its  beak.  The  traditional  house

colors are scarlet and sable, and the daemon-

fey incorporate both hues into their garb.

The daemonfey are structured into a loose

hierarchy, with Sarya in control.

HIERARCHY

The daemonfey are ruled by the eldest member

of House Dlardrageth. In this case, that individual

is Sarya (CE female sun elf half-fiend Sor17), the half-

elven, half-demon countess of House Dlardrageth. Only two

half-fiends  remain  of  the  Dlardrageth  clan,  Sarya  and  her

nephew  Xhalth  (CE  male  sun  elf  half-fiend  Bbn12).  Baron

Xhalth  used  to  harbor  plans  of  unseating  his  aunt  as  the

leader  of  the  daemonfey,  until  he  saw  her  kill  her  own  son

Ryvvik  without  hesitation.  The  rest  of  the  daemonfey  are

feyri  of  the  Dlardrageth  and  associated  clans,  a  handful  of

allies, and servants.

The Daemonfey

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  daemonfey  are  driven  by  the  desire  to  punish  the  elven

race for the humiliation and suffering the elves caused them.

Sarya  plans  to  capture  sun  elves  and  use  them  as  breeding

stock,  mating  them  to  summoned  demons  in  the  deep  bolt-

holes under the High Forest. Eventually, shell have a small

half-demon and feyri army, and with that force shell wreak

chaos and havoc on the elves of the North.

The  daemonfey  have  already  abducted

several sun elves from the Silver Marches

and are holding them prisoner in prepara-

tion  for  bringing  in  the  outsiders  for

breeding.  Before  she  can  embark  on

that  plan  in  earnest,  however,  she

and  her  feyri  followers  are  en-

gaged  in  an  aggressive  program

to  educate  themselves  about  the

sort  of  place  that  Faern  has

become  in  their  absence.  Small

scouting  missions  composed  of

three  or  four  feyri  make  their

way  stealthily  through  the

woodlands, spying on the other

creatures there. These scouting

parties  take  great  care  not  to

be  seen  or  noticed,  since  tip-

ping off the elves to their pres-

ence  now,  while  the  group  is

still  weak,  would  be  disastrous

to their plans.

RECRUITING

The daemonfey believe in forcible

recruitment.  They  abduct  sun

elves  whom  they  consider  suit-

able candidates for demonic breed-

ing,  and  thereby  induct  them  into

the  society  as  unwilling  associates.

The  daemonfey  plan  to  rear  the

offspring  of  these  foul  unions  as

their own and to dispose of the elven

parents as quickly as possible.

ALLIES

The  daemonfey  prefer  to  keep  to  them-

selves,  but  they  sometimes  work  alongside

evil  humanoids  for  a  short  duration.  Though  their  ancestors

considered the drow to be degenerates, Sarya has considered ap-

proaching them to discuss an alliance, since they seem to share

some of the same goals.

To  date  the  daemonfey  have  not  dared  to  approach  any

mages  living  in  civilized  areas  with  offers  of  alliance,  even

though  they  could  certainly  use  the  arcane  knowledge  to  be

gained by such associations. Sarya has recently become aware

of a small but powerful cabal of wizards and sorcerers living in

Luskanthe Arcane Brotherhoodwho might not be averse

to working with half-fiends and feyri. She plans to make con-

tact with the Brotherhood just as soon as she learns the loca-

tion of their headquarters.

127

ENEMIES

The  daemonfey  consider  themselves  superior  to  all  other

beings  of  Faern,  and  cast  anyone  who  might  stand  against

them in the role of enemy. Their most venomous hatred and

eternal enmity is reserved, however, for the entire elven race,

and in particular moon elves and wood elves. Countess Sarya

feels an intense, personal loathing for the Silver Marches, be-

cause that confederation is exactly the kind of experiment that

her irritatingly smug elven kin would attempt, and she is cer-

tain that the mutual defense pact was somehow

orchestrated by the elves of the High Forest.

Encounters

Small groups of daemonfey might be

encountered along the outskirts of

the  High  Forest  and  throughout

the North. A typical encounter is

one  feyri  leader  who  is  a  rogue

of  at  least  7th  level,  accompa-

nied by a sorcerer and a pair of

fighters.  Individual  encounters

are  likely  to  be  with  solitary

scouts.

Daemonfey  Encounter  (EL

8): 1  daemonfey  scout  leader

(CE  feyri  Rog7),  1  daemon-

fey  mage  (CE  feyri  Sor4),

and 2 daemonfey guards (CE

feyri Ftr2).

Daemonfey

Bolthole

The  daemonfey  know  the

locations of a number of un-

derground  structures thro-

ughout  the  North  that  are

not  familiar  to  the  younger

races  that  now  dwell  there.

Older  elves  probably  know

about many of these places, but

have  no  reason  to  presume  that

anyone  is  making  use  of  them

again. By the time the elves realize their ancient foes have re-

turned, Sarya hopes it will be too late for them to stop the re-

vitalized daemonfey.

The bolthole described here was once a dwarven way station

where tired dwarves could stop and rest on their journeys be-

tween strongholds. It is located in the northern eaves of the

High Forest, about 20 miles west of the Stone Stand. It is cur-

rently occupied by a scouting party that is en route to the dae-

monfey  stronghold  after  a  successful  spying  mission  in  the

Silver Marches. Unless otherwise noted, each room is lit with a

pair of torches thrust into iron sconces just inside and to either

side of the doorways.

The Daemonfey

1. Staircase

Characters who pass within 30 feet of the top of the staircase

should make a Spot Check (DC 20) to notice the boltholes en-

trance,  hidden  by  a  manufactured  deadfall  of  brush  and

boughs. The stairs are strewn with dead pine needles, bits of de-

cayed leaves, and scatterings of dirt. The center of each stair is

relatively  free  of  this  debrisa  sign  that  this  staircase  has

been well used recently.

2. Great Hall

Those familiar with dwarven architecture recognize it immedi-

ately in the style of this large chamber. All the accoutrements

and  appointments  that  made  it  a  welcoming  respite  from

travel are now gone, replaced by the stench of sweat, road dust,

and  the  faint  but  unmistakable  whiff  of  brimstone  that  ac-

companies some of the feyri.

A pair of daemonfey warriors (CE male feyri Rog2/Ftr1)

waits here at all times, sitting on the floor near the bottom

of the entrance stairwell, on the lookout for trouble. If they

discover intruders, they rush to the attack, and the sound of

the battle draws the attention of all other creatures within

the bolthole.

3. Vesryns Chamber

Vesryn (CE male feyri Sor10) has taken this room for himself

while he tries to determine the best route back to the daemon-

fey headquarters.

Appendix I.

Vesryn  is  an  exceptionally  tall  and  cadaverously  thin  feyri

with dark copper hair. His fiendish heritage is readily apparent

when his true form is visible, but he spends much of his time in

other, less distinctive shapes (his favorites are that of a portly

human sorcerer with wild, white-blond hair or a moon elf of

noble bearing and quiet demeanor).

Vesryn joined with House Dlardrageth after he was freed

from  imprisonment  following  the  destruction  of  Hellgate

Keep. He has sworn his obedience to Sarya, and carries out her

instructions  with  relish.  He  believes  wholeheartedly  in  her

agenda, and supports it by making himself available or scout-

ing missions and raids.

4. Teryanis Chamber

Saryas  chief  scout,  Xhalths  daughter  Teryani  Ealoeth  (CE

female feyri Rgr7), stays in this chamber. The room holds her

traveling  gear:  a  backpack  (normal  adventuring  equipment,

plus six tindertwigs and a vial of alchemists fire), a +2 master-

work  shortbow,  a  quiver  of  30  arrows  and  10  masterwork

arrows, and a potion of invisibility.

5. Curing Chamber

The  sharp  smell  of  game  permeates  the  air  of  this  room.

Stretched  out  on  makeshift  racks  assembled  from  tree

limbs are six deer hides that the daemonfey are curing for

later use.

6. Warriors Chamber

The  warriors  who  guard  the  entrance  to  the  bolthole  store

their possessions here, typical adventuring gear.

7. Scouts Room

The three remaining members of the party have elected to

share  this  room.  They  are  Jhaartael  Ealoeth  (CE  male

feyri  Ftr2/Sor2),  Laerdya  Floshin  (CE  female  feyri

Rog5), and Sariandi Floshin (CE female feyri Ftr4). Their

travel-worn  gear,  backpacks  containing  normal  adventur-

ing  equipment,  and  pieces  of  the  same  are  strewn  among

their bedrolls.

These stairs descend to the lower level.

8. Stairs

9. Kitchen

This was once a kitchen where the dwarven travelers prepared

their meals. Now it smells of the kill once again, for it contains

the slaughtered carcasses of three deer that the feyri killed re-

cently. The carcasses hang from stone hooks built into the ceil-

ing on the opposite side of the door for this very purpose. The

blood drains into a shallow gutter that carries the liquid away

into  the  earth.  A  large  fire  pit  dominates  the  center  of  the

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/23/01  6:21 PM  Page 129

The Daemonfey

kitchen, filled with recently gathered fallen timber that awaits

only a flame.

10. Storage Chamber

The dwarves sometimes stored dried and preserved foodstuffs

here, but now its the last resting place of a monstrous large

spider that had been dwelling within this chamber before the

feyri slew it. They have not yet bothered to remove its repul-

sive carcass.

11. Trophy Room

The daemonfey have removed the antlers from the buck deer

they killed and affixed them to the wall of this chamber. The

antlers (six sets in all, no significant value) function both as

trophies of the hunt and as convenient drying racks for cloaks

and outer garments.

12. Prisoners

Each of these three small chambers, formerly dwarven sleep-

ing rooms, holds a pair of elven prisoners restrained in mana-

cles.  The  daemonfey  captured  these  folk  (all  of  whom  fit

Saryas breeding criteria, since they are particularly fit and at-

tractive  members  of  the  elven  race)  during  their  excursion

into the Silver Marches. They are being marched back to the

daemonfey  stronghold  to  await  the  start  of  Saryas  infernal

breeding program.

13. Dwarven Shrine

Three  giant  dwarven  faces,  one  on  each  wall  (except  for  the

wall near the entrance), glower at the center of this room. This

area was a shrine consecrated to dwarven deities. The daemon-

fey  havent  done  more  than  look  inside  briefly  because  the

place makes them feel uncomfortable.

14. Natural Cavern

This  entire  complex  was  once  a  natural  cave  system,  as  evi-

denced by the unworked portion here. The dwarves who built

this place either did not have the opportunity to finish, or left

the cave as it was for some other reason (perhaps as a tribute

to a dwarven deity).

Three  frightened  quaggoths  hide  in  the  rearmost  part  of

the cavern. The feyri looked into the cave briefly but failed to

notice the concealed creatures. The quaggoths were the slaves

of an illithid, but they managed to escape from their master a

short  time  ago.  Emerging  from  the  Underdark  many  miles

from  here,  the  creatures  made  their  way  through  the  forest

until  they  stumbled  upon  this  complex.  They  thought  that

they had found an ideal place to shelter until the daemonfey

showed up a couple of days later. Fearful of being pressed again

into  slavery  or  killed  outright,  the  quaggoths  have  remained

inside the cave. Their meager supply of food has run out now,

however, and their growing hunger will prompt them to acts

of desperation if the daemonfey do not leave soon.

The Eldreth Veluuthra

The Eldreth

Veluuthra

The  forest  was  almost  idyllic  that  morning,  with  the  early

spring sunshine peeking through the budding branches of the big

trees.  Ferin  the  woodcutter  smiled  at  the  sight.  It  had  been  a

hard winter. He and his business partner, Luth, were walking

toward a stand of silver birch trees that theyd been meaning to

cut last autumn, before an early snow put an end to their plans.

Are  you  sure  were  on  the  right  path?  asked  Luth.  This

trail doesnt look familiar to me. He frowned. Ferin sighed in-

wardly. Trust Luth to find something to worry about.

He bit back a retort and replied instead, Trust me, I know

exactly where we are. They walked a few dozen yards far-

ther along the trail, when Luth stopped suddenly and motioned

for Ferin to do the same. Irritated, Ferin was about to shout an-

grily about the time they were wasting when Luth whispered,

Did you hear something?

Ferin  shook  his  head.  No,  all  he  heard  were  the  normal

sounds of the forest: the wind sighing in the tree limbs, the soft

squish  of  dead  leaves  underfoot,  and  the  constant  twitter  of

theno, wait a moment. Where was the birdsong?

Watch  out!  Luths  warning  came  too  late.  An  arrow  ap-

peared  in  his  chest  and  he  went  down  silently,  the  shaft  still

quivering with the impact. Ferin was next. It was over in sec-

onds,  and  the  trio  of  grim-faced  elves  emerged  from  the  low

bushes where they had concealed themselves for the ambush.

The  Eldreth  Veluuthra  is  a  fanatical  elf  supremacist  group

dedicated to the proposition that humans are little better than

vermin, and must therefore be eradicated from Faern. This

ancient  and  secretive  organization  has  been  active  since  the

founding  of  Myth  Drannor.  Its  members  are  scattered

throughout  the  elven  territories  of  Faern,  particularly  in

those areas that were largely vacated during the Elven Retreat

and are now underpopulated, including Ardeep, Cormanthor,

the High Forest, the Moonwood, the Chondalwood, the Win-

terwood, the Neverwinter Woods, and the Border Forest. The

members of the Eldreth Veluuthra strike at their hated ene-

mies,  launching  not  only  murderous  attacks  against  humans

but  also  plans  and  schemes  intended  to  slow  or  even  halt

human expansion beyond its already sizable territories.

Brief History

The seeds of the hatred felt so keenly by the members of the

Eldreth  Veluuthra  were  planted  long  ago,  when  the  great

elven city of Myth Drannor was founded in 261 DR. By the

end of the following year, five important elven houses had de-

cided that their ideology could not encompass the acceptance

of humans as anything other than the worst sort of degenerate

creatures.  From  their  point  of  view,  humans  seemed  little

more than unclean beasts, with even less sense than the mon-

sters that roamed the wild. As the patriarch of House Starym

pointed out, humans foul their own nests, destroying the land

they  claim  before  moving  on  to  ruin  whatever  lies  over  the

next hill.

Humanitys  disinclination  to  live  harmoniously  with  the

land (as the elves were accustomed by their nature to do) en-

raged  the  members  of  these  five  families  to  the  point  that

their hatred of humans became their prominent defining fea-

ture. The refusal of these families to tolerate humans resulted

in  considerable  social  and  political  strife  within  Myth  Dran-

nor. The coronals decision to open the city to nonelves was the

last straw.

But rather than allowing this development to provoke open

conflict (a development that the dissenting families felt would

give the humans a victory by proxy over the elves), the mem-

bers of the five houses chose instead to depart Myth Drannor.

In the centuries that followed, the elders of these families met

secretly with elves who shared their philosophy of hatred, and

together they discussed and debated how best to deal with the

pestilential  humans.  That  they  had  their  work  cut  out  for

them seemed clear. Humans were spreading across Faern like

wildfire, settling in areas that the elves generally disdained and

thereby giving themselves a territory increasingly larger than

that held collectively by the elven people.

As they debated, these elves tallied up what they saw as the

ever-growing number of reasons to hold humans in contempt.

They watched in horror as greedy humans deprived their own

kin  of  food  while  lining  their  pockets  with  coin.  They  ob-

served  with  outrage  the  slash-and-burn  tactics  humans  em-

ployed  when  they  warred  against  one  another,  often

destroying  the  land  more  thoroughly  than  they  destroyed

their enemies. And they ground their teeth in white-hot fury

as  humans  committed  the  ultimate  act  of  shortsightedness,

cutting down huge swaths of virgin timber just to create graz-

ing land for livestock.

The  Weeping  War  (711714  DR)  that  destroyed  Myth

Drannor was the event that finally gave birth to the society as

a formalized organization. The members of the organization

could  no  longer  sit  idly  by  and  merely  catalog  the  crimes

against  nature  that  had  been  perpetrated  by  the  human

vermin.  They  felt  the  burning  need  to  do  something  that

would strike a blow for elvenkind. They began to divide them-

selves into smaller groups to train for the task they had ap-

pointed  for  themselveskilling  humans.  Taking  the  name

Eldreth  Veluuthra  (Victorious  Blade  of  the  People),  the

human-loathing elves claimed their first successes in 757 DR,

initiating a series of lethal attacks that persist to this day.

The Organization

Headquarters: None.

Members: About 100.

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leaders: The Blade Lords.

Religion: Corellon Larethian.

Alignment: CN, CE, NE.

Secrecy: Low.

Symbol: A stylized longsword driven through the top of a

human skull and emerging through the mouth, with cracks in

the skull radiating from the point of the swords entry.

The  Eldreth  Veluuthra  is  a  loosely  organized  group  of  like-

minded fanatics. The individual cells of the organization com-

municate with one another only rarely, each acting on its own

to support and further the cause.

The Eldreth Veluuthra

One  of  the  most  notable  aspects  of  the  organization  is

that it does not include any divine spellcasters. The members

of  the  Eldreth  Veluuthra  worship  only  the  deities  of  the

elven  pantheon,  butparadoxicallynone  of  the  elven

deities are of an alignment that is favorable to the organiza-

tion.  Some  of  the  Eldreth  believe  that  the  group  should

admit  drow  clerics  to  gain  easier  access  to  healing  and

restorative magic. But others find that notion abhorrent and

refuse to take the easy way out. They are certain that, even-

tually, one of the elven deities (probably Corellon Larethian)

will recognize the merit of the groups mission. On that day

the Victorious Blade of the People will admit its first clerics

to the ranks of membership. Until then, it must rely on the

open  market  and  the  goodwill  of  sympathizers  for  healing

magic. (Cash, therefore, has become of great importance to

the organization, and some of its missions are now directed

specifically at generating coin with which to purchase heal-

ing potions.)

HIERARCHY

The  leaders  of  the  Eldreth  Veluuthra  are  the  VelNikeryma

(Blade Lords), a guiding council that determines what mis-

sions  will  best  contribute  to  the  societys  goals.  The  council

members  (described  below)  are  chosen  by  popular  acclaim

from  among  the  most  senior  members  of  the  organization.

They spend much of their time gathering and analyzing intel-

ligence  from  agents  and  sympathizers  stationed  in  or  near

human  population  centers,  and  from  this  information  they

devise briefs for potential missions. The council exercises little

direct authority over the society, however. Individual members

are  expected  to  conduct  their  own  missions  that  support  the

long-term goals of the Eldreth Veluuthra, working alone or in

small teams. Members may choose to undertake one of the as-

signments  devised  by  the  Blade  Lords,  but  they  are  not  re-

quired to do so. Even with this degree of autonomy, it is rare

that a mission that the Blade Lords deem important lacks for

volunteers to fulfill it.

The two newest members of the Blade Lords, Talindra and

Saevel, have replaced previous members Fhaertala Hyshaanth

and Sythaeryn Selakiir. The lich Fhaertala was destroyed when

the  daemonfey  discovered  her  spying  on  them.  Sythaeryn,  a

sea elf, lost interest in the affairs of the surface world and re-

turned to his undersea home.

Bhyrindaar  Silverhart  Tellynnan (CE  male  moon  elf

werestag Ftr9/Sor1/Arc5): Elected to the guiding council only

recently,  Silverhart  shifted  his  operations  this  year  to  the

northern reaches of the High Forest. He has a particular in-

terest in thwarting the ambitions of the humans of the Silver

Marches.  A  native  of  Evereska,  he  contracted  lycanthropy

from  a  human  werestag  that  he  fought  and  slew  in  battle.

Rather than risk passing his affliction on to other elves, Sil-

verhart  chose  to  quit  Evereska  and  confine  himself  to  the

wilderness.  This  self-imposed  exile  has  done  little  but  foster

within him a fierce desire to revenge himself on the members

of the race of the monster that ruined his life. He is by far the

most outspoken and emotional of the Blade Lords, as well as

the most impatient. He advocates stepping up the pace of the

societys  attack,  insisting  that  at  their  current  rate  the

humans will surely win the race. His tirades against caution

have sometimes come dangerously close to turning the other

members of the council against him. Nevertheless, Silverhart

remains a popular leader among the rank and file, both for

his unrelenting enthusiasm for the cause and his successes in

the field.

Eldaerneth Spellstalker (CE male sun elf Enc7/Rog8). See

his entry in the Night Masks section of this book.

Tordynnar  Rhaevaern (NE  male  sun  elf  lich  [baelnorn]

Wiz15/Acm3):  From  his  crypt  deep  beneath  the  Wood  of

Sharp  Teeth,  where  he  lairs  with  the  old  green  dragon

Claugxinaurak who serves as his steed, Tordynnar carries out

the agenda that he began so many centuries ago. Since he is

the only remaining member of the founders of the Eldreth

Veluuthra,  all  members  of  the  society,  including  his  fellow

Blade Lords, accord Tordynnar great respect and deference.

His personal hatred of humanity is relentless and unquench-

able. Tordynnar is given to plans of considerable complexity

that  take  years  to  come  to  fruition,  but  that  nearly  always

prove successful.

Talindra  Amalith (CN  female  wild  elf  Bbn14):  When  the

human-led  party  of  adventurers  entered  Talindras  native

Methwood in search of a fabled lost city of the Turami race,

her village of wild elves observed the interlopers carefully. But

a tragic misunderstanding resulted in a fatal clash between the

scouts and the adventurers that left the scouts dead and the ad-

venturers determined to wipe out the wild elf settlement.

Talindra herself was away from the village with a hunting

party when the slaughter occurred, but she returned to see the

grisly handiwork. Talindra led her hunting party against the

adventurers,  claiming  vengeance  for  her  murdered  people.

From  that  day  forward,  she  has  dedicated  herself  to  the  de-

fense of the Methwood against any humans who might seek to

penetrate its borders. Two years ago she and her hunters made

their way into Shussel, taking up residence in one of the aban-

doned districts of the city. From there they proceeded to Un-

thalass, where they made contact with agents of the Eldreth

Veluuthra. Talindras battle rage has inspired a legend around

her within the Victorious Sword, leading to her appointment

to the council of Blade Lords this year.

If  adventurers  run  seriously  afoul  of  the  Eldreth  Velu-

uthra, Talindra volunteers to address their intrusion into the

organizations affairs.

Saevel Calaudra (NE male moon elf Rog8/Asn4): Growing

up alone in the streets of Hillsfar would be difficult enough

for any child, but for this young elf it was nothing short of

nightmarish. Saevel knows nothing of his parentage or lineage.

His  earliest  memories  are  of  stealing  bread  from  homes  and

shops in the roughest parts of town. Understanding, perhaps

instinctively, that his nonhuman heritage would surely mean

his death if it were discovered, young Saevel took pains to dis-

guise  his  elven  features.  His  circumstances  embittered  him

toward  humanity,  and  this  deep-seated  antipathy  only  in-

creased as he grew into young adulthood.

One  fateful  night  Saevel  chanced  upon  a  pair  of  the  city

watch manhandling an elven prisoner and, unable to restrain

the fury that rose up inside himself, he came to the elfs aid.

Not wishing to end his life in the arena, Saevel led the rescued

elf outside the city through routes known only to thieves and

smugglers.

The elf whom Saevel had rescued was none other than El-

daerneth Spellstalker, who was in the city ostensibly to carry

out a mission for the Night Masks, though naturally he had

taken the opportunity to scout the metropolis for the Eldreth

Veluuthra.  When  Eldaerneth  revealed  his  true  allegiance  to

Saevel, it seemed only natural to the young elf that he should

join the society.

Since  then  he  has  trained  to  become  one  of  the  organiza-

tions  most  capable  killers.  He  quickly  earned  a  reputation

among his peers as a consummate, fearless operative by volun-

teering  forand  completingmissions  that  most  considered

suicidal.  He  was  selected  for  membership  in  the  Blade  Lords

last year, but he still personally undertakes assignments for the

organization. At only 108 years of age, Saevel is the youngest

of the Blade Lords, and many members of the Eldreth Velu-

uthra believe that he is destined for even greater distinction.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

Eldreth Veluuthra means Victorious Blade of the People,

but  like  the  names  of  many  fringe  political  groups,  the

grandiose title doesnt accurately reflect either the success en-

joyed  by  the  organization  or  its  reputation  among  its  own

people. While the members of the organization have enjoyed

numerous  successes  in  their  chosen  crusade,  even  they  must

confess that their efforts have not resulted in anything even

remotely resembling a comprehensive setback for the humans

as a race.

Meanwhile, other elves who know of the Eldreth Veluuthra

rarely admit to it. To most, the group is an embarrassment at

best, and a topic to be avoided if at all possible. It is perhaps

ironic that fanaticism is a personality trait many elves would

associate more readily with humans than with their own race,

but this fact is apparently lost on the Victorious Blade.

The  organizations  motivation  is  hatred,  and  its  goal  is

simplewipe out as many humans as possible. Its methods are

equally simplistic, since most of the Eldreth Veluuthras oper-

ations are focused on the elimination of humanity. A few Vic-

torious  Blade  missions,  particularly  those  designed  and

supported  by  Tordynnar  Rhaevaern,  are  formulated  to  take

advantage  of  the  humans  short  life  spans  and  even  shorter

Eldreth Veluuthra ambush

The Eldreth Veluuthra

memories, blocking or impeding human expansion into wilder-

ness territories.

The  agents  of  the  Eldreth  Veluuthra  arent  choosy  about

their  targets.  Disrupting  human  activities  of  any  kind,  from

trade caravans to agriculture, falls within their scope of opera-

tions  and  is  justified  by  their  supremacist  attitude.  Human

rangers, hunters, explorers, and similar folk are frequent targets

of opportunity, since they represent the vanguard of human en-

croachment into new areas. Human pioneers and settlers are ha-

rassed ruthlessly, since destroying their homesteads sometimes

slows or even halts expansion into a given territory. Half-elves,

who the Eldreth Veluuthra consider abominations, are victim-

ized in a like manner.

The  society  employs  four  main  types  of  tactics,  described

here with examples of each.

Direct Action: Killing humans outright. It should be noted

that, as much as they might wish to do so, the agents of the or-

ganization  do  not  wantonly  slay  every  human  that  crosses

their path. To do so would be foolish, because it would expose

the elves to unnecessary risk of capture or death.

Indirect  Action: Inciting  other  groups  or  races  to  attack

humans  and  their  settlements.  Agents  of  the  organization

have instigated more than one orc raid on a human village.

Natural Attack: Diverting a river to flood farmland, intro-

ducing predators to slay livestock, or sending dangerous crea-

tures to plague human communities.

Economic Attack: Disrupting caravan routes through acts of

highway robbery, sealing off mines that produce valuable miner-

als, gems, or ores, or sending plagues of insects to destroy crops.

Most members of the Eldreth Veluuthra are nothing if not pa-

tient.  They  realize  that  their  vision  of  a  Faern  devoid  of

humans will require considerable time to bring about. This atti-

tude is reflected in their operations. A squad of Victorious Blade

rangers can afford to spend months, even years, reconnoitering

a new human settlement and its environs. Humans who are the

victims  of  Victorious  Blade  attacks  have  no  way  of  knowing

that their movements and progress may have been watched for

years or even decades before the blow falls. It seems the humans

have the upper hand, for now, but the elves can wait. After all,

they have time.

RECRUITING

The majority of the members of the Victorious Blade are sun

elves. A few moon elves, wild elves, and wood elves fill out the

ranks as well. Drow are not permitted membership, for the El-

dreth  Veluuthra  hates  the  dark  elves  nearly  as  much  as  it

loathes humans, despite the shared social views of both groups.

Most  recruits  are  younger  elven  fighters,  rogues,  or  wizards

who have a personal grievance against humans.

ALLIES

A tiny minority of elvesprimarily sun elves, but a few from

other subraces as wellsympathize with the Victorious Blade.

These sympathizers sometimes provide the agents of the El-

dreth Veluuthra with aid and support in the form of supplies

and information. Information is particularly important to the

operation of the group, and the Blade Lords take care that the

informants serving the organization are treated and rewarded

well. Another minority of elves, roughly equal in number to

the sympathizers and informants, share the Victorious Blades

point of view about the undesirability of humans, but they do

not approve of the societys violent methods.

ENEMIES

Chief among the enemies of the Victorious Blade are the ubiq-

uitous Harpers, whose meddling agents are the target of per-

haps a third of the organizations offensive activities. Anyone

and anything that directly aids humanity and human commu-

nities also draws the enmity of the Eldreth Veluuthra. Rangers

of all races who protect or aid human settlements, for exam-

ple, and druids whose groves are located near human commu-

nities are considered legitimate targets.

Despite the fact that some items on their respective agendas

are similar, the Eldreth Veluuthra feel nothing but antipathy

for  the  daemonfey,  whom  they  consider  abominations  of  a

rank equal to half-elves.

Encounters

Encounters  with  the  Eldreth  Veluuthra  are  most  likely  in

woodland areas where the group is most active. Because they

eschew urban areas except in the course of information gather-

ing,  members  of  the  organization  are  normally  not  encoun-

tered in communities bigger than large towns. The small cells

that  defend  a  territory  normally  include  one  elf  fighter,

ranger, or wizard leader; one elf rogue or wizard; and one elf

trainee (normally a fighter, ranger, or wizard).

The Eldreth Veluuthra considers its ability to operate in se-

crecy to be its most treasured asset. Its enemies cannot strike

at what they cannot find. Of almost equal importance are the

members deep feelings of solidarity for one another. Betrayal

among  the  members  of  the  Victorious  Blade  is  almost  un-

known; most would rather die than divulge information dam-

aging to their cause or brethren.

Arguably  the  greatest  weakness  of  the  group  is  its  single-

minded devotion to one ideal. The members of the organiza-

tion  are  inflexible  in  their  beliefs  and  attitudes  toward

humans, and an enemy that is aware of their fanaticism can

sometimes use it against them.

The members of the Eldreth Veluuthra prefer to avoid any

confrontation in which they do not set the terms and control

the terrain. They are fond of attacking from ambush, and do

not  consider  such  tactics  the  least  bit  dishonorable  when  di-

rected against humans and those allied with them. Before un-

dertaking  missions,  they  make  an  effort  to  practice  for  the

types  of  terrain  and  conditions  they  believe  they  will  en-

counter.  When  they  cannot  avoid  a  direct  confrontation  or

stand-up fight, members of the organization fight as a team

and try to use wolf-pack tactics (surrounding enemies and at-

tacking one at a time to wear opponents down) whenever pos-

sible.  They  do  not  hesitate  to  sacrifice  themselves  when  the

situation demands it, especially if doing so would ensure either

the success of a mission or the security of the organization.

The Fire Knives

The Fire Knives

Lady Jhenna smiled coyly at the young prince and slipped out

of her silk dress.

Come  to  me,  my  lord.  Come  to  me  and  kiss  me,  she  whis-

pered to him.

The smiling Cormyrian noble gathered Jhenna in his arms,

and they kissed deeply, passionately.

Jhenna  knew  the  prince  would  feel  the  blade  as  it  pene-

trated his soft belly, but as the poison was drawn into his liver,

he would quickly experience a cold flood of . . . ecstasy? Bliss?

She wasnt quite sure.

Lady  Jhenna  ended  the  kiss  and  stepped  back  so  that  the

prince  could  admire  her  perfect  form  in  the  moonlight.

She also brought up her right hand to her breast, and the

princes blood left a small crimson trail on her skin as

it dripped off the end of the stiletto.

The young Cormyrian tried to scream, tried to grab

the beautiful assassin, but could only slump to his knees

as the numbness quickly spread through his body.

Jhenna knelt in front of the dying man, kissed

him on his forehead, and whispered into his ear.

Parting,  she  said  evilly,  is  such  sweet

sorrow.

A small but deadly band of aristocratic killers, the

Fire Knives are assassins-in-exile. Originally a soci-

ety of skilled murderers who based themselves in

Cormyr,  the  members  of  the  organization  were

forced to abandon their homeland when their role in

the  assassination  of  a  local  lord  was  discovered  and

brought  into  the  public  eye.  Long  thought  by  the

Cormyrian monarchy to be defunct, the Fire Knives secretly

regrouped and now operate from the city of Westgate, where

they have allied with the Night Masks.

Brief History

The  Fire  Knives  trace  their  origins  back  to  over  four  cen-

turies  ago,  when  the  founders  of  the  group  assembled  a

rough  but  ready  band  of  rogues,  thugs,  and  bandits  into  a

loose confederation. This guild plied its trade in the south-

ern parts of Cormyr, its numbers rising in relation to its suc-

cesses. Its depredations made the southern roads unsafe for

travelers,  despite  the  efforts  of  the  monarchys  soldiers.

Eventually the guild boasted many hundreds of skilled and

well-trained criminals in its pay, as well as many more un-

skilled  thugs  and  bandits,  secretly  controlled  by  nobles

whom none would suspect (or dare accuse). Not content with

robbing  travelers  on  the  high  road,  the  guild  members

started going after bigger game. Their success led to infamy

that nearly proved their undoing.

In  1227  DR,  brigands  attacked  a  royal  caravan  and  slew

King Dhalmass and his queen, Jhalass. Blame fell immediately

on the Fire Knives. Whether the group was actually guilty of

this regicide, or whether it was merely a convenient scapegoat,

remains  unknown.  The  current  Grandfather  of  Assassins

maintains that it was all a setup from start to finish, and that

this  was  the  first  in  a  long  serious  of  unfair  persecutions

against the Fire Knives sponsored by House Obarskyr. Facing

execution  if  apprehended,  the  members  of  the  Fire  Knives

went to ground and remained in hiding. They quietly reestab-

lished  themselves  in  cities  on  the  borders  of  Cormyr.  How-

ever,  the  incident  instilled  within  their  ranks  a  deep-seated

and  venomous  hatred  for  the  nobility  of  Cormyr,  and  for

House  Obarskyr  in  particular,  since  that  family  was  at  the

head  of  the  pack  that  was  calling  for  the  heads  of  the  Fire

Knives on a pike.

During  the  years  that  followed,  as  the  Fire  Knives  con-

ducted their customary illicit operations, they also pursued an

aggressive agenda of vengeance against the Cormyrian nobil-

ity. Their campaign of revenge was quite successful. They and

their agents were directly responsible for at least two dozen

unexplained  deaths  among  the  noble  and  royal  house  of

Cormyr.  But  eventually  luck  or  fate  ran  against  them,

and they were exposed as the killers of the very popular

Lord Belgard Huntsilver in 1341 DR. King Azoun IV,

sorely  aggrieved  by  the  loss  of  his  childhood

friend, ordered a nationwide hunt for the killers,

condemning  them  to  permanent  banishment

from the Forest Kingdom. The exiles took up res-

idence  in  Tilverton  and  Westgate,  where  they

sought to rebuild their haggard organization so that

they  might  exact  their  final  revenge  on  Cormyr

and its king. They were nearly broken for good in

1357 DR when their plan to assassinate Azoun IV

backfired,  killing  nearly  all  the  Westgate  mem-

bers of the organization.

The remaining members of the Fire Knives re-

grouped  once  more,  slowly  and  painfully,  beginning

in  1369  DR  when  the  exiled  branches  of  House  Bleth

and House Cormaeril arrived in Westgate. Senior people in

both families desired greatly to avenge their humiliation by

reviving one of Cormyrs most notorious enemies and turning

it against their homeland once more.

A Fire Knives assassin at work

his assistants, who in turn command the various branches of

the organization and its members.

Lord  Tagreth  Cormaeril  (LE  male  human  Ftr3/Rog7/

Asn7) tolerates absolutely no dissent within the ranks of his

organization.  A  cantankerous  and  disagreeable  curmudgeon,

Tagreth is not as frail or helpless as he appearsa fact that a

number of would-be usurpers and coup leaders have learned,

to  their  sorrow.  The  elderly  nobles  unnatural  vigor  comes

from  magical  sources.  He  has  paid  a  staggering  fortune  in

gold and treasures over the years for spells that help prolong

his life and bolster his health, despite his advanced years. He is

acutely aware that both his family and the Fire Knives have

fallen on hard times, and he worries that his dwindling per-

sonal fortune is running out, forcing him to confront the rav-

ages of time at last. He has contemplated seeking the means

to become a lich, but the notion of becoming a skeletal mon-

strosity holds little appeal.

The Fire Knives close association with (or manipulation

by)  the  Night  Masks  does  not  sit  well  with  the  current

Grandfather of Assassins. He knows full well who and what

the  Night  King  is,  just  as  he  knows  and  understands  the

nature of the Court of Night Masters. He also knows that it

is no longer possible for the Fire Knives, or any other band

of organized criminals, to operate within Westgate without

coming  to  terms  with  the  vampires  who  lead  the  Night

Masks.  Orbakh  has  shared  his  dreams  of  empire  with

Tagreth,  who  has  no  quarrel  with  the  notion  of  lording  it

over the entire Dragon Coastparticularly if it means being

able  to  stick  it  to  Cormyr  and  its  insufferably  noble  royal

family into the bargain.

Orbakh and his minions appear to be exerting an increasing

degree of control over the younger members of the organiza-

tion.  By  seducing  some  of  the  most  ambitious  young  Fire

Knives  with  vague  (and  almost  certainly  false)  promises  of

eternal life, the Night King now has considerable influence in

the day-to-day affairs of the society. Tagreth worries that his

control over the Fire Knives is slipping, and he has begun to

think that one night soon he may be obliged to confront the

vampire king in a struggle that should determine the fate of

the guild.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  Fire  Knives  want  to  kill  as  many  members  of  the

Cormyrian nobility as possible. Some members believe that the

Fire Knives should focus all their resources and energy on de-

stroying only House Obarskyr, which they view as the genuine

architect of the guilds misfortunes. However, the Grandfather

of Assassins has remained firm in his dedication to targeting

the entire gamut of Cormyrs nobility.

Some muted grumbling exists among the younger genera-

tion of Fire Knives, fueled by the skillful manipulations of

the Night King. These youthful assassins believe that work-

ing to advance Orbakhs plan to make an empire out of the

Dragon Coast is far more attractive than spending all their

days plotting the deaths of a handful of nobles whom many

of  them  have  never  met  personally.  They  claim  that  the

Night Kings plan would allow the Fire Knives to subjugate

Cormyr  militarily  and  economically,  a  far  more  appealing

prospect.

Regardless of their missions or political views, the members

135

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  8:35 AM  Page 136

House Karanok

of this organization prefer to conduct their murderous activi-

ties by taking advantage of their status as refined aristocrats

who  can  move  freely  and  unobtrusively  within  high  society.

They employ their noble heritage to good effect when travel-

ing and getting close to their targets. More than one victim

has  mistaken  his  assailant  for  nothing  more  than  a  feather-

headed  fop,  right  up  until  the  moment  when  the  assassins

blade slips between his ribs.

The  Fire  Knives  prefer  to  use  poison  blades  (giant  wasp

poison,  when  they  can  get  it,  but  nearly  any  toxic  substance

works), getting close to their targets by means of either their

aristocratic wiles or their clever disguises. They are not above

slipping a toxin into a victims food or drink if necessary. They

disdain what they consider brutish weapons, such as garrotes

and crossbows.

Most Fire Knives agents work alone when they undertake

assassinations.  Some  use  a  small  number  of  accomplices  who

can help them set up the killing and escape safely afterward.

Surprisingly enough, the fees that the Fire Knives charge for

their lethal services are scaled to meet the resources of the em-

ployer. The Grandfather of Assassins realizes the value to be

had in undertaking and fulfilling contracts of all sorts. Theres

no substitute for getting your hands dirty, he likes to say to the

younger  killers  (much  to  their  annoyance),  and  so  he  some-

times  agrees  to  undertake  assassinations  for  lower  fees  than

the Fire Knives might be able to demand. This custom allows

the newer members of the guild to gain valuable, firsthand ex-

perience in the field, and in addition makes it possible for more

practiced assassins to keep their skills of stealth and observa-

tion as sharp as their blades.

RECRUITING

Because most of the Fire Knives are members of the nobility,

born into two elite (if tarnished) households, the organization

seldom  recruits  far  from  the  family  tree.  Although  not  all

members  of  the  exiled  branches  of  House  Bleth  and  House

Cormaeril are members of the Fire Knives, many are, and they

perform  a  variety  of  functions  for  the  organization  beyond

killing. The Fire Knives are far more likely to hire nonfamily

members into lesser positions, or engage their services on an

as-needed basis.

Another  aspect  of  the  guilds  relationship  to  the  Night

Masks that disturbs the Grandfather of Assassins is the Fire

Knives growing dependence on the vampires for resources and

information. Why go to all the trouble of conducting exten-

sive  reconnaissance  of  a  target,  some  of  the  younger  Fire

Knives reason, when Orbakhs minions provide the same infor-

mation for little or no cost? This is a trend that Tagreth de-

tests,  and  it  feeds  his  fears  that  the  Fire  Knives  are  being

slowly assimilated into the vampires own thieves guild.

Encounters

The FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting contains informa-

tion and statistics for the typical Fire Knives agent.

Typical  Fire  Knives  Assassination  Squad  (EL  8): 1  Fire

Knives killer (human Rog4/Ftr1/Asn2); 2 attendants (human

Com3); 1 bodyguard (human Ftr2).

House Karanok

Presmer  awoke  in  pain.  Though  one  eye  was  swollen  shut,  he

could see that he had been tied to a metal rack on a pile of brush

and weeds. Strange figures in white robes glared at him. He

had no idea how he had gotten here.

What am I doing here? Release me!

The leader of the robed group spoke. Wizard Presmer, you

are about to be executed for your crimes.

Crimes? With what crime are you charging me?

The  leader  chuckled.  Why,  witchcraft,  of  course.  And

then his fire spell ignited the pyre.

The city of Luthcheq in Chessenta is ruled by a mad family

called the Karanoks. They worship a being they call Entropy,

the Great Nothing, and they plot the destruction of all wiz-

ards  (sorcerers,  wizards,  dwarves,  or  elves).  Folk  outside

Chessenta  (and  outside  Luthcheq,  for  that  matter)  consider

them fools, for Entropy is said to just be a giant sphere of an-

nihilation. Be that as it may, some divine entity is now answer-

ing their prayers, and Entropy has given birth to five smaller

spheres. Now those of House Karanok have acquired mansions

in  other  cities  of  Faern  and  moved  the  smaller  spheres

(known to the family as the daughters of Entropy) to these

locations, using the mansions as bases for their scheme to de-

stroy all wizards.

Unknown to the Karanoks, the power of Entropy is admin-

istered by Tiamat, the deity behind the venerated hero Tchaz-

zar.  Tiamat  saw  an  opportunity  to  grab  power  from  the

zealous faith of the Karanok family, and has used the sphere of

annihilation as a funnel for her power. The followers of En-

tropy are now capable of casting cleric spells, a development

that  they  see  as  a  sign  that  their  strange  deity  has  blessed

them, and now is the time to strike beyond Chessenta.

Brief History

In  1161  DR,  the  Karanok  family  became  the  leaders  of

Luthcheq under suspicious circumstances. While all records of

the events have been destroyed, it is likely that assassination

was  involved,  since  no  known  descendants  of  the  old  noble

family survive today. They practiced an erratic but moderately

efficient rule of the city, warring with other city-states in typ-

ical Chessentan fashion. In 1324 DR, Luthcheq invaded Mor-

dulkin  to  take  advantage  of  the  latters  serious  losses  from

plague but was defeated. Blaming their loss on wizard spies in

the service of Mordulkin, the Karanoks became obsessed with

the destruction of wizards.

Sometime around 1346 DR, a particularly large sphere of

annihilation appeared in the largest mansion of House Kara-

nok. The sphere materialized in the middle of a torture cham-

ber  and  completely  consumed  the  wizard  who  was  being

tortured. Seeing this as an omen, the members of the house fell

to their knees and worshiped the planar anomaly, which they

called Entropy. Remodeling their mansion to make its current

location  a  main  temple  chamber,  the  Karanoks  blindly  wor-

shiped  their  nondeity  in  the  belief  that  it  would  help  them

meet their goals.

In late 1370 DR, the deity Tiamat used her power to alter

136

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  8:36 AM  Page 137

House Karanok

the  sphere,  making  it  a  conduit  for  her  energy.  She  began

granting divine spells to the nobles of House Karanok in the

guise  of  Entropy.  She  has  since  caused  the  sphere  to  create

smaller  spheres,  which  can  be  controlled  by  members  of  the

house. The Karanoks worship the daughter spheres, and they

have  been  known  to  conjure  forth  scaly  reptilian  monsters

(abishai) to enact the will of the Karanoks and Entropy itself.

the Organization

These statistics apply to the Karanok noble house of Chessenta

as a whole.

Headquarters: Luthcheq, Chessenta.

Members: approximately 300 members of the noble house,

plus guards and servants.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: Maelos Karanok.

Religion: Entropy (Tiamat).

Alignment: LE.

Secrecy: None  (although  groups  outside  Chessenta  conceal

their identity and agenda).

Symbol: The symbol of House Karanok is the Thorass letter

for K, above which is a burning branch (probably representing

witchweed).

HIERARCHY

The  Karanoks  have  a  cellular  structure  based  around  the

original Entropy and its five daughter spheres. They are well

organized but allowed to function almost independently. The

following  are  some  of  the  more  important  members  of

House Karanok.

Maelos (LE  male  human  Ari18/Clr1  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]) is an ancient man, nearly senile and rarely able to

understand  that  his  family  now  has  a  slight  chance  of  suc-

ceeding at its goals.

Jaerios (NE male human Ari13/Clr4 of Entropy [Tiamat])

is Maeloss son and the ruler of the city. He enjoys power and

particularly enjoys watching wizards burn.

Naeros (NE  male  human  Ari3/Ftr9/Clr1  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]) is Jaerioss son. Arrogant, cruel, and fond of disfig-

uring  his  victims  before  burning  them,  Naeros  believes  he

cannot  be  killed  and  can  do  whatever  he  wants  because  his

familys power protects him.

Kaestra (LE  female  human  Ari4/Clr7/Ent3  of  Entropy

[Tiamat])  is  the  most  powerful  cleric  in  the  family  and  the

nominal head of all religious activities.

Povros (LE male human Ari6/Clr5) is Jaeross cousin and

the leader of one of the Entropy cells not located in Chessenta.

Raised  to  hate  wizards,  he  doesnt  even  carry  magic  items

unless he knows they were created by clerics (even if they were

clerics of inferior deities).

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

Hatred is the primary motivation of the Karanoks. They hate

wizards more than anything, and those who willingly deal with

wizards are a close second. They kidnap known wizards, then

burn them on a pyre of witchweed (see the appendix) as a sac-

rifice  to  their  strange  deity.  They  have  a  standing  offer  of

10,000 gold pieces as a reward for anyone who slays Elminster,

the  Simbul,  or  Khelben.  They  sometimes  come  into  contact

Karanok family members

137

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  8:37 AM  Page 138

House Karanok

with the Zhentarim, but that groups ties to wizards makes it

an  undesirable  alliy.  The  Karanoks  also  enjoy  vandalizing

Thayan  enclaves  and  (if  kidnapping  and  murder  are  not  an

option) harassing apprentices in those places.

RECRUITING

The Karanoks are open to working with anyone who is inter-

ested in killing wizards. This means they have an easy time re-

cruiting  close-minded  or  fearful  people  to  their  cause  but

rarely have anyone of power at their beck and call. They tend

to  have  many  thugs  in  their  service,  and  sometimes  try  to

overwhelm their wizard opponents with sheer numbers.

ALLIES

Other  than  members  of  their  own

house  and  their  guards  and  ser-

vants,  House  Karanok  has  few

allies  beyond  the  confines  of

Luthcheq.  Within  their

home  city,  any  noble  can

call upon the city guard for

assistance,  which  makes  at-

tacking  the  Karanoks  in

their  city  a  dangerous  and

foolish proposition.

Encounters

A  typical  encounter  with

the  Karanok  family  is  with

one or two members of the

house  (aristocrats  or  aristo-

crat/clerics  of  3rd  level  or

higher)  and  four  to  ten

bodyguards  (1st-level  war-

riors). More powerful mem-

bers  of  the  house  tend  to

have  greater  numbers  of

bodyguards  rather  than

more  powerful  ones.  A  few

rare  encounters  at  night

might  include  a  single

abishai  of  any  color,  always

wearing a heavy robe to conceal

its nature.

The  Karanoks  prefer  ambushes,  since

they are not willing to allow wizards the opportu-

nity  to  profane  the  air  and  their  bodies  with  wizardry  in

honest combat. They send waves of thugs to beat and grapple

their wizard opponents, while clerics use multiple silence and

hold person spells to prevent the wizards from casting spells.

Nonspellcasters are dealt with in more conventional ways. If

at all possible, the Karanoks prefer to eliminate wizards one at

a  time  rather  than  attacking  entire  adventuring  parties,  but

have been known to attack groups if they are desperate or es-

pecially eager.

Entropist Prestige Class

As the Karanoks explore their new spellcasting abilities, some

of the most advanced students gain an attunement to the body

of  Entropy  or  its  daughters.  These  students  develop  strange

powers and new uses for their divine link, and although doing

so retards their progress as spellcasters, they see their new abil-

ities as worth the cost.

An entropist is a cleric of the aspect of Tiamat known as

Entropy, which is manifested as a large sphere of annihilation.

Obsessed  with  destroying  wizards,  they  harness  the  power  of

the sphere and learn how to protect themselves against

its  effects.  Like  all  clerics  of  Entropy,  they

wear  white  robes,  sometimes  marked

with a single black circle.

Most  entropists  have  gained

some  levels  as  a  cleric,  and

most  are  aristocrats  from

the  Karanok  family  in

Luthcheq.  It  is  possible

for  others  to  join  this

prestige class if they prove

their  worth  to  the  Kara-

noks  and  their  loyalty  to

Entropy.  Sorcerers,  wiz-

ards,  elves,  and  dwarves

are never entropists.

Entropists  work  to-

gether and with clerics of

Entropy.  Most  followers

of Entropy hold them in

awe  for  the  powers  they

possess  and  their  strange

link to the Great Nothing.

Hit Die: d8.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  entropist  prestige

class. Spell-like abilities use the entropists divine caster level.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Entropists gain no profi-

ciency with weapons, armor, or shields of any type.

Spells  per  Day: An  entropist  continues  training  in  divine

magic while attuning himself to the powers of entropy. Thus,

when the character reaches 2nd level or 4th level in this class,

he increases his spellcasting ability as if he had also gained a

level  in  a  divine  spellcasting  class  he  belonged  to  before  he

added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other

benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance  of  rebuking  or  commanding  undead,  favored  enemy,

and so on). If a character had more than one divine spellcast-

ing class before she became a entropist, she must decide when

she reaches 2nd level or 4th level to which class she adds these

spellcasting levels.

cation, or polymorph. These effects cannot affect the entro-

pist  unless  he  wishes  them  to.  He  is  also  unaffected  by  a

sphere of annihilation, passing through it as if it were empty

air. A hand of entropy or eye of entropy (see below) has no

effect on him.

Arcane Resistance (Su): An entropist of 2nd level or higher

gains  a  +2  bonus  on  all  saving  throws  against  arcane  spells,

whether they originate from the Weave or the Shadow Weave.

Hand of Entropy (Sp): By expending an available spell slot,

an entropist of 3rd level or higher channels the power of En-

tropy into a black haze around one hand. The hand of entropy

can be used to make a melee touch attack as a standard action,

and deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per level of the spell

slot used to create it. The hand can be used on the round it is

created and lasts up to a number of rounds equal to the entro-

pists divine caster level. For example, a Clr7/Entropist3 could

expend a prepared cure moderate wounds spell (2nd level) to

create a hand of entropy that deals 1d6+2 points of damage and

lasts  10  rounds.  The  hand  otherwise  functions  like  a  touch

spell. The entropist can use this ability multiple times per day

as long as a spell slot is expended each time.

Arcane Disruption (Sp): Once per day, an entropist of 4th

level  or  higher  can  create  a  magical  field  of  energy,  which

manifests as a slight smoky haze that interferes with the cast-

ing of arcane spells. The field is a 30-foot emanation centered

on  the  entropist.  Anyone  attempting  to  cast  arcane  spells

within  the  field  must  succeed  at  a  Concentration  check  as  if

casting  on  the  defensive  (DC  15  +  spell  level).  If  the  check

fails, the spell is lost. The field lasts for a number of rounds

equal to the entropists divine caster level.

Eye of Entropy (Su): Once per day, for a maximum of 5

rounds, an entropist of 5th level can create a miniature sphere

of entropy. The eye of entropy is absolutely black, 2 inches in

diameter, and can be moved up to 30 feet by the entropist as a

standard  action.  Against  objects,  the  eye  deals  3d6  points  of

damage, bypassing the objects hardness. Against creatures, the

entropist must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if suc-

cessful the eye deals 3d6 points of damage to the target (Forti-

tude half, DC 12 + the entropists Wis modifier); this bypasses

damage reduction since it is a magical effect. The eye appears

in the entropists square when it is created, and can be moved

and used to attack on the round it is formed. If the entropist

stops concentrating on the eye, it vanishes.

Karanok Mansion

This section describes a small Karanok mansion and base of op-

erations. This mansion could be in any city, particularly those

close to Chessenta.

MANSION LAYOUT

These  locations  indicate  rooms  within  the  Karanok  mansion.

Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  doors  in  the  mansion  are  simple

wooden  doors  with  average  locks  (Open  Lock  DC  25).  The

doors are well maintained (not stuck). Interior doors that do

not  lead  to  bedrooms  are  usually  unlocked.  At  night,  small

lanterns in the hallways provide illumination.

1. Entryway

The door leading outside is a strong wooden door with a good

lock  (Open  Lock  DC  30).  This  small  room  is  guarded  by  a

single person (LN human War1) when the house is open to re-

ceive visitors, and is otherwise bare.

4. Storage

This  storage  area  is  filled  with  shelves  and  contains  various

household supplies.

5. Servants Chambers

Each chamber like this is the home of two house servants (LN

human Com1). Each has two beds (or a single bed, if the two

servants are a couple) and a pair of chests.

6. Kitchen

This area contains a large sink, stove, and many shelves. The

shelves  have  cookware,  utensils,  ingredients,  and  so  on.  The

door leading outside is a strong wooden door with a good lock

(Open Lock DC 30) and is kept locked when nobody is using

the kitchen.

9. Guardroom

Any personal guards of visitors stay here so they may watch

over the guests in area 8.

10. Temple Chamber

This  rectangular  room  contains  a  2-foot-diameter  globe  of

blackness  hovering  in  midair,  many  kneeling  cushions,  and

paintings on the walls representing a black sphere raining de-

struction upon wizards of all kinds. A secret trapdoor in the

floor leads to area 24.

1116. Nobles Rooms

Each of these rooms is the quarters of one of the minor nobles

of the house. All the rooms are similarly furnished with a bed,

desk, bureau, and chair.

The nobles occupying each room are as follows:

11: Sandirathae (LE female human Ari1).

12:  Tappho  (LE  female  human  Ari1/Clr1  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]).

13: Chemis  (LE  male  human  Ari2/Clr1  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]).

14:  Balchae  (LN  female  human  Ari1/Clr2  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]).

15:  Gaukon  (LE  male  human  Ari3/Clr2  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]).

16:  Pantheria  (NE  female  human  Ari4/Clr3  of  Entropy

[Tiamat]).

The Iron Throne

19. Senior Guardroom

This is the room of a senior guard of the family (LE human

Ftr3). The families of these guards have served the Karanoks

for two generations. The tidy room has a bed, desk, and chair.

20. Hallway of Tapestries

This  broad  hallway  is  lined  with  tapestries  depicting  life  in

Luthcheq, as well as one showing Zuthoheq, a famous (and de-

ceased) member of the Karanok family.

21. Bathing Room

The main features of this room are a large iron stove with a

built-in  water  tank  (used  to  provide  hot  water  for  a  bath),  a

bathtub,  and  a  curtain  to  provide  privacy.  The  door  in  the

north wall has a good lock (Open Lock DC 30). The secret door

on the east wall is a typical secret door (Search DC 20).

22. Guardpost

A guard (LN human War1) stands watch here whenever visi-

tors are in the house to prevent any not of the faith from en-

tering  the  room  beyond.  Both  doors  to  this  room  have  good

locks (Open Lock DC 30) and are kept locked at all times.

23. Wizard Dungeon

This is where the family keeps kidnapped wizards before exe-

cuting them. Sets of manacles have been pounded into the wall.

The manacles are designed to lock hands and feet, as well as to

prevent any movement from the subject. Imprisoned wizards

are usually stripped of all possessions and gagged as well. (Wiz-

ards who are manacled, gagged, and stripped of material com-

ponents have a hard time casting spells.)

24. Wizard Burning Room

A small stone dais on the far end of the room supports a small

pile of wood and witchweed. The wall behind the dais has a metal

frame to which a person can be chained. Small holes in the ceil-

ing  above  the  dais  allow  smoke  to  flow  upward  into  area  10,

where they are absorbed by the sphere of annihilation (the Kara-

noks see this as a way of making offerings to Entropy when they

burn a wizard). The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to area 10.

25. Secret Exit

This  tunnel  leads  eastward  and  (after  a  pair  of  closed  doors)

connects to a part of the sewer. This passage is sometimes used

to smuggle kidnapped wizards into the mansion.

The Iron Throne

The caravan horses reared and plunged, panicking as the brig-

ands charged up and over the lip of the gully that ran alongside

the dusty roadway. In moments the wagon train was in disar-

ray.  The  attack  had  been  so  swift  that  it  had  left  the  wagon

masters with no time to organize a defense. The grinning brig-

and  leader  cantered  up  to  the  caravan  master,  who  squinted

into the sun to make out the burly mans features.

Well  met,  Master  Gaedynn!  boomed  the  armed  and  ar-

mored rider. A fine day for a journey across these dangerous

wild lands, is it not? Caravan master Gaedynns ears twitched.

He  didnt  know  this  brigand,  but  the  criminal  clearly  knew

him. Good intelligence, he mused. This is no ordinary raid.

Take what you want, he replied in a tone that suggested he

was far from happy. I suspect that we would be unable to stop

you anyway.

Youre too kind, said the brigand with a smile. He glanced

around at his men, who were swiftly unloading boxes, crates, and

barrels from the wagons. Apparently satisfied with their progress,

he  turned  his  attention  back  to  the  caravan  master  and  said,

Now,  Gaedynn,  theres  the  small  matter  of  a  conversation  you

had three nights ago in that tavern, the one with the stupid name.

The Drunken Drow? ventured Gaedynn in what he hoped

was a helpful manner. The brigand grinned again.

Thats  the  one!  You  were  speaking  with  one  of  your  con-

federates,  a  certain  timber  merchant  from  Baldurs  Gate.

You told him that you were concerned that you hadnt hired

enough guards for this trading venture. You were right, as it

turns out, but thats beside the point. The brigand lowered his

voice; his smile vanished, and his eyes grew cold. The impor-

tant thing is that you told your friend that you suspected that

the  banditry  on  this  road  was  being  sponsored  by  the  Iron

Throne.  Again,  you  were  right,  but  your  suspicions  will  cost

you more than trade goods. Faster than Gaedynns eye could

follow, the brigand produced a hand crossbow and shot him

through the throat.

On  the  surface,  the  Iron  Throne  appears  to  be  just  another

merchants guild. The group is ostensibly dedicated to pursuing

a monopoly on the weapons trade in certain parts of Faern, a

goal it has pursued with unbridled zeal. While other merchants

and  traders  have  accused  the  Iron  Throne  of  increasing  its

share of the weapons trade through such unsavory practices as

banditry and murder, such complaints are hardly unusual be-

tween competitors. At least, so say the merchants who are the

nominal leaders of the Iron Throne.

The truth is that this mercantile company is more than just

another band of avaricious merchants out to make a gold piece

at the expense of ethics. The public faces of the Iron Throne are

merely  mouthpieces  for  the  true  leaders  of  the  organization,

ruthless  killers  who  stop  at  nothing  to  achieve  the  Iron

Thrones economic goals. The masters of the Iron Throne think

nothing of cutting out the competition with every dirty trick at

their disposal. The groups sinister aspects go deeper than mere

murder, however. When compared to those of their fellow mer-

chants,  the  uses  to  which  the  Iron  Throne  intends  to  put  its

filthy  lucre  are  certainly  more  than  a  little  unusual,  not  to

mention dangerous.

Brief History

The  Iron  Throne  is  a  relatively  recent  development  in  the

economic history of Faern. It was originally the brainchild

of  a  unique  individual:  Sfena,  the  daughter  of  a  powerful

devil.  A  skilled  assassin,  she  used  her  talents  to  serve  her

father and his internecine wars against the other denizens of

Baator.  A  strange  accident  befell  Sfena  during  one  of  her

missions to kill an enemy in Faern, in 1347 DR. Her entire

body hardened into a material of crystalline appearance and

hardness. The accident that changed her thus also freed her

from  Baator,  allowing  her  to  remain  in  Faern.  Sfena  con-

ceived the Iron Throne as a means of restoring herself. She

141

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  9:29 AM  Page 142

The Iron Throne

intended  to  trade  the  entire  organization  to  a  devil  or  per-

haps another extraplanar power in return for the restoration

of  her  body.  She  invented  the  name  of  the  organization

during a speech to her first contingent of minions: We shall

rule  the  Heartlands  with  an  iron  fist.  We  shall  rule  them

from an Iron Throne, built of the weapons of our trade, and

the shackles of our slaves, the common nails of our wagons,

and the iron in the blood of those who oppose us. Iron has

power, and so shall we.

Sfenas  words  were  prophetic.  The  Iron  Throne  quickly

gained a sizable stake in the weapons trade, branching out into

the area of equipment used for trade and commerce (such as

caravan  wagons,  horses,  and  the  attendant  supplies).  Sfenas

tactics were engineered in such a fashion that her representa-

tives could insist that the organization always acted within the

letter of the law. No act of theft, sabotage, or murder

was  beneath  her  and  her  minions,  however,

and other merchants quickly learned that to

cross the Iron Throne meant that they had

to  be  prepared  for  various  kinds  of  as-

saults  and  interventions  against  them-

selves and their businesses.

Sfena disappeared just over a year

ago,  in  1371  DR,  under  circum-

stances  that  suggest  diabolical  in-

volvement.  Her  chief  lieutenants

suspected that her father, or one of his

enemies,  spirited  Sfena  back  to  Baator.

When  she  vanished,  the  organization  was

thrown  into  chaos.  Battle  lines  were  quickly

drawn between Sfenas lieutenants, each of whom

thought he would make the ideal leader for the coster in

their  mistresss  absence.  Sfenas  second  in  command,

Krakosh,  eventually  seized  control  of  the  group  by  allying

himself  with  several  other  lieutenants.  By  the  time  they

emerged  victorious  from  the  conflict,  however,  the  Iron

Throne had already lost ground in the weapons trade. Krakosh

and his aides are now engaged in a serious attempt to restore

and exceed the organizations former power.

the Organization

Headquarters: Merchant offices in Suzail.

Members: 3,530.

Hierarchy: Segmented.

Leader: Krakosh.

Religion: The Iron Throne venerates no particular deity as

an organization. Kelemvor, Mask, Shar, Waukeen are all popu-

lar religions.

Alignment: LN, LE, CN, CE, NE.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: A stylized iron throne. The group uses a simplified

line drawing of this symbol as a trail and property marker.

HIERARCHY

The lower echelon of the Iron Throne is divided into units that

function  independently.  Only  Krakosh,  Maready,  and  their

closest aides know the entire interlocking structure of the or-

ganization. The individuals who undertake the day-to-day oper-

ations get information strictly on a need-to-know basis.

Krakosh  (CN  male  storm  giant  Sor10)  met  Sfena  during

the ill-fated assassination attempt that altered her form. Her

father assigned her the task of eliminating the daughter of a

storm  giant  noble  who  dwelled  in  Faern  but  was  allegedly

contemplating  an  assault  on  the  devil  lords  holdings.  The

storm  giants  apprehended  her  during  the  mission,  and  be-

headed  her.  Much  to  everyones  surprise,  she  did  not  perish

when  her  head  came  away  from  her  neckamazingly,  her

bones and tissues crystallized. She was very much alive, though

decidedly grotesque.

Krakosh,  a  storm  giant  living  in  the  stronghold  at  the

time of Sfenas arrival, was thoroughly dissatisfied with his

life.  The  son  of  a  courtier  who  was  out  of  favor  with  the

ruling noble, Krakosh found his familys humiliation hard to

bear.  He  had  long  been  considering  a  departure  from  his

home,  and  the  arrival  of  the  intriguing  little  as-

sassin  seemed  to  be  the  catalyst  he  had  been

awaiting. Freeing the now-crystalline Sfena

from the nobles dungeon, he helped her

escape  from  the  giants  stronghold

and  traveled  with  her,  aided  by  an

amulet of alter self that disguised the

storm  giants  true  form.  The  young

storm  giant  fell  in  love  with  his

strange  companion  during  the  course

of  their  journeys;  in  time,  she  pro-

fessed  to  return  his  affections.  He

became  her  chief  lieutenant  when  she

founded  the  Iron  Throne.  Krakosh  knew

that Sfenas mercantile ambitions were mo-

tivated by a desire to restore her body, and he was as

eager as she to bring this about. Utterly devoted to Sfena,

he undertook whatever tasks or missions she requested. His

mere  presence  helped  keep  her  other  lieutenants  and  their

lackeys in line.

When Sfena disappeared, Krakosh at first believed that she

had been slain as part of an attempted coup started by some of

the other Iron Throne agents. Seeking vengeance, he launched

devastating  attacks  against  those  he  believed  responsible,

sparking  an  all-out  war  among  the  remaining  adjutants.  He

allied with the wizard Maready, after the spellcaster convinced

Krakosh that not only had he nothing to do with their leaders

disappearance,  but  that  there  was  every  chance  that  she  was

still alive and in the hands of some devil or rival. The pair of

them  won  the  struggle  for  control  of  the  Iron  Throne,  and

since  then  Krakosh  has  dedicated  himself  to  restoring  his

beloveds  creation  to  its  former  state.  With  Maready  as  his

aide-de-camp, the storm giant has already made great strides

toward doing exactly that.

Krakosh rarely appears in his giant form, preferring to pass

for a human with his amulet of alter self.

Maready  (NE  male  half-elf  Wiz13/Rog3),  a  Sembian  by

birth,  originally  signed  on  with  Sfena  and  Krakosh  for  the

power and wealth they offered. He continued to work with the

Iron Throne, but as the years went by he was no longer satis-

fied  with  the  benefits  that  the  organization  could  offer.  He

began to privately question Sfenas motivations and capabili-

ties. Maready believed that the Iron Throne could double or

even triple its gains annually if someone more intelligent were

Iron Throne agents raid a caravan

in chargesuch as himself, for instance. Aware of Sfenas dia-

bolic ties, Maready decided to take advantage of her history.

He managed to get word to Sfenas devil lord father, advising

him  of  his  childs  whereabouts.  As  he  had  anticipated,  the

devils minions eventually appeared to seize Sfena and return

her to Baator, where Maready hopes she remains for all eter-

nity. It was then a simple matter for Maready to manipulate

the  anguished  Krakosh  into  taking  on  the  remaining  lieu-

tenants, leaving the storm giant and himself in control.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

Krakosh desires, above all things, to locate Sfena and recover

her. Unfortunately, he doesnt have the faintest idea where to

start looking, and neither does Maready (or so he claims). He

has ordered that all members of the organization search the

areas  in  which  they  do  business  for  signs  or  rumors  of  their

missing  leader.  Meanwhile,  he  intends  to  increase  the  opera-

tional area of the Iron Throne so that the search area can like-

wise be expanded. For all he knows, Sfena is in the hands of one

of their trading rivals, or rotting in the dungeon of some king,

waiting for rescue. He is prepared to scour Faern for her, and

does not hesitate to use whatever means are necessary to re-

cover her. He relies heavily on Mareadys judgment and con-

sults the wizard before making any important decisions.

Meanwhile, the Iron Throne is largely Mareadys to run as

he  likes,  through  his  storm  giant  ally.  Krakosh  has  proven

most  tractable  when  it  comes  to  changing  business  practices.

All Maready needs to do is claim or imply that his advice en-

ables the storm giant to make the Iron Throne more success-

ful, thus increasing his chances of finding his lost love. When

the time is right and Krakosh has served his purpose, Maready

intends  to  eliminate  him  and  rule  the  Iron  Throne  himself.

Maready has already convinced Krakosh that the group should

begin trading in drugs, acquiring them from the Red Wizards

enclaves and reselling them for higher profits elsewhere.

The  rank  and  file  membership  consists  primarily  of  mer-

chants,  caravan  masters,  soldiers,  brigands,  rogues,  drovers,

craftsfolk, spies, assassins, and saboteurs. The vast majority of

these  folk,  whose  numbers  encompass  nearly  every  civilized

Faernian race, have as their primary desire the acquisition of

wealth. A limited number desire wealth and power, and from

this segment the most talented and skilled are promoted to po-

sitions of authority within the organization.

The Iron Throne is actually engaged in the legitimate trade

of arms and armor. Their caravans are welcomed in numerous

cities throughout the Heartlands for the masterwork and mag-

ical weapons they convey (many of which are stolen, salvaged

from  dungeons  by  hired  adventuring  parties,  or  made  by

craftsfolk who were cheated out of their rightful profits). The

group also smuggles weapons, in order to avoid taxes and other

inconvenient laws. Their most successful tactic in the weapon

trade,  however,  is  raiding  the  caravans  of  their  competitors.

The  Iron  Throne  is  always  very  careful  to  ensure  that  the

raiders appear to be nothing more than common brigands. The

society encourages its legitimate merchants to strive to main-

tain an air of respectability. The leadership has found that an

appearance of honesty helps defeat accusations to the contrary.

The  organization  employs  a  goodly  number  of  agents

charged  with  the  task  of  tracking  down  and  punishing  those

who cross it. Folk who break contracts with the Iron Throne

are  likely  to  be  murdered,  defamed,  or  sold  into  slavery,  de-

pending on which option is most expedient and cost-effective.

The Kir-Lanans

RECRUITING

The  Iron  Throne  recruits  extensively  and  indiscriminately

from among the dregs of society for the criminals it requires

to enforce its wishes. Wages are reasonable, normally the pre-

vailing  rate  for  the  type  of  work  and  geographic  area,  with

generous  bonuses  for  those  who  demonstrate  a  genuine  flair

for their work. The Iron Throne actively recruits adventurers

and  adventuring  parties,  hiring  them  to  scour  dungeons  and

other dangerous locales for valuable weapons and armor. The

organization pays adventurers well, but insists upon a contract

that enjoins the employees from keeping any masterwork or

magic weapons or armor they may locate for themselves.

Encounters

Encounters  with  the  Iron  Throne  typically  are  with  their

hired agents, such as brigands, smugglers, and thieves, or the

merchants  who  handle  their  legitimate  caravans.  Should  ad-

venturers  come  into  possession  of  information  that  would

enable  Krakosh  to  learn  something  about  Sfenas  current

whereabouts,  they  might  find  themselves  in  a  confrontation

with the master of the Iron Throne himself.

The kir-lanans

What in the name of the Forest Queen is it? Thersos had to

shout  to  make  himself  heard  above  the  din  of  battle.  The

winded ranger was forced  to fight on the defensive, swinging

his  longsword  and  dagger  in  a  protective  arc  as  the  vicious

winged  creature  drove  him  backward  across  the  shrines  cob-

bled yard. He might as well as have saved his breath, for his

companion made no reply. Perspiration ran freely down Meras

face and neck as she formed the words of an arcane spell. She

hoped  that  her  magic  missile  would  bring  the  creature  down,

but as the glowing bolts struck home, the sorcerer realized that

her attack had not delivered nearly enough damage to stop this

thing. It continued to harry Thersos, and it was with growing

fear that the ranger realized that the creatures chilling touch

had deprived him of the strength he needed to make his blows

count.

The pair of young adventurers had stopped at this roadside

shrine to Lathander just as twilight was falling. Still several

days out of Triel, Thersos and Mera had hoped to break their

long journey with the clerics who tended the shrine, enjoying a

warm hearth and a comfortable bed for the first time in over a

month. They had arrived at the place just in time to witness the

final moments of its caretakers, three members of Lathanders

clergy who were ripped to messy ribbons before the adventurers

horrified  eyes  by  a  pair  of  mysterious  creatures,  the  likes  of

which neither had ever seen before. The strange creatures were

human-sized, but heavily muscled and covered with fine black

scales. Their wings and short horns recalled the features of a

gargoylebut no gargoyle ever sapped a warriors strength with

merely a touch of its scaly hand.

Mera cried out in alarm as black claws ripped through the

fighters chainmail and drove deep into his side. The blow spun

her  companion  half  around  and  sent  him  to  his  knees.  She

started  forward  to  help,  but  a  glance  at  Thersoss  eyes  told

Mera that life had already fled. The pair of lethal creatures

then immediately turned to advance on her. The fanged maw

of the larger one split into what Mera thought might be a mock-

ing grin, and to her amazement it actually spoke to her, in halt-

ing but clear Common:

Weakling godslave, you die, too.

They were the last words that Mera would ever hear.

Whatever they may be, the kir-lanans (the creatures name for

their race in their own harsh language) are not gargoyles. The

name  is  a  misnomer,  bestowed  on  them  by  adventurers  who

mistook the creatures for some strange, new type of gargoyle

when the beings appeared in Faern shortly after the Time of

Troubles. The kir-lanans do share some physical characteristics

with gargoyles: Both have large, batlike wings, short horns, and

sharp,  naillike  claws.  But  the  resemblance  ends  there.  These

creatures are most definitely a race apart, having no kinship

ties to any other beasts or peoples living in Faern today.

The kir-lanans appeared for the first time, as far as anyone

can determine, immediately after the Time of Troubles. The

learned minds of Faern speculate that the kir-lanans sudden

and  unheralded  appearance  in  the  world  was  somehow  con-

nected to one or more events that transpired during that con-

fused,  and  turbulent,  era.  Since  they  were  first  sighted,  the

kir-lanans have proven remarkably resistant to inquiries into

their nature, customs, and habits, responding with brutal sav-

agery when provoked. Even when left alone, the creatures dis-

play  a  pronounced  antipathy  for  anyone  and  anything  even

remotely connected to the deities of Faernclerics, druids,

paladins, rangers, and even lay worshipers included. Groups of

the  creatures  have  terrorized  temples  and  shrines  across

Faern, without any apparent provocation.

At first, these attacks appeared to be disorganized, almost

random, as if the creatures could not decide where, when, and

how  they  wished  to  strike.  Most  of  the  kir-lanans  early  as-

saults were directed against places of worship and the persons

within them. They attacked temples, shrines, and groves dedi-

cated  to  Faerns  deities,  plaguing  the  clergy  and  worshipers

they found at these sites and doing their utmost to desecrate

the structures. Many of these attacks were poorly coordinated,

and the defenders were often able to drive the attacking kir-

lanans  away  with  a  strong  display  of  resistance.  Gradually,

however, the activities of the creatures took on a more organ-

ized and directed aspect. No longer content with focusing their

efforts on centers of worship, the kir-lanans have increasingly

targeted the deities worshipers wherever they may encounter

them. Pilgrims traveling a road are as much at risk as a monk

in  his  monastery.  The  kir-lanans  assaults  have  increased  not

only in frequency but also in lethality. Of late, the creatures

have shown evidence of battlefield tactics that they did not dis-

play in previous years. While it is possible, folk agree, that the

creatures could have improved their fighting skills, a more dis-

turbing possibility must be considered: The kir-lanans may be

receiving assistance from some greater intellect or power.

Brief History

The loremasters and sages who speculate that the kir-lanans ap-

pearance in Faern is linked somehow to the Time of Troubles

are indeed correct. But their surmise only scratches the surface

of  the  strange  and  unprecedented  origin  of  this  malevolent

144

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  9:32 AM  Page 145

The Kir-Lanans

race. The kir-lanans were born of the tremendous divine ener-

gies  created  by  the  deaths  of  three  deities:  Bane,  Bhaal,  and

Myrkul,  who  were  slain  during  the  ill-fated  Godswar  (see  the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting for a more detailed dis-

cussion of this event). The passing of these three evil deities was

marked  by  the  release  of  untold  amounts  of  divine  energy,

manifesting itself in various acts of destructive nature. A por-

tion of this energy remained in Faern for some time after the

deities  in  question  had  passed,  pooling  and  coalescing  until  it

became a roiling maelstrom of divine and negative energy. The

effect remained extant only briefly, but long enough for some-

thing to stir within and fight its way free of its chaotic black

depthsthe first of the kir-lanans.

Several  hundred  of  the  creatures  entered  existence  in  this

fashion, each fully formed and possessed of the terrible knowl-

edge of its origin. Unlike other races, the kir-lanans were not

born into a state in which they could share in the divine grace

of the deities. They were created from the deities folly, con-

demned forever to exist without the possibility of gaining the

favor of the divine. No amount of pious prayer or devout wor-

ship matters to the kir-lanans, for the condition of their cre-

ation denies them any beneficence wrought by any deity.

The kir-lanans know only one goal in their bleak existence:

to vent their fury against the deities. Since the time of their

creation,  they  have  pursued  an  agenda  of  guerilla  warfare

against all who are able to bask in the favor of any deity, no

matter how humble or minor that divinity may be. If the crea-

tures could smite the deities themselves, they surely would, but

the  deities  faithful  must  bear  the  wrath  of  the  kir-lanans

anger  in  their  stead.  Striking  without  warning  or  mercy

against  those  who  gather  in  places  sacred  to  deities,  the  kir-

lanans have become the whispered terror on the lips of clergy

everywhere,  the  darkest  evil  lurking  in  the  mind  of  every

acolyte and adept. Each month, it seems, brings a new tale of

slaughter and desecration visited on a place of worship in some

corner of Faern, leading folk everywhere to wonder if their

church or shrineor themselvesmight be next.

KIR-LANAN LORE

Adventurers throughout Faern have heard tales of the black

gargoyles, dark stalkers, winged drow, and the godless,

all of which are common nicknames for the kir-lanans. Some

have  even  fought  the  creatures,  or  spoken  with  those  who

have. But the complete newness of the race and the confusion

over their aims has led to a dearth of hard facts about the crea-

tures. Captured specimens have proven remarkably resistant to

persuasion even of a violent nature, preferring death over the

betrayal of their fellows (though spells such as detect thoughts

and zone of truth have been effective, provided that the ques-

tioner  knows  the  right  questions  to  ask  and  understands  the

captives responses).

Consequently, a number of rumors and suppositions circulate

about the creatures. It is said, for example, that the Night Masks

have enslaved a number of kir-lanans and now use them as spies.

Folk traveling to Westgate are sometimes warned that the gar-

goyles they see perched atop the high places of the city may ac-

tually be kir-lanans, who swoop down to rend the guilds enemies

limb from limb. Other tales focus on the alleged powers that the

creatures display. It is commonly thought in the Moonsea that

kir-lanans  are  invulnerable  to  most  weapons  and  spells.  Those

who repeat this gossip cite the fact that three clerics of Shar at-

tempted to fend off an assault by a group of kir-lanans by blast-

ing the winged horrors with inflict spells that would have slain

an ogre. The magic had no effect on the kir-lanans, who then cut

the trio to ribbons where they stood. The story of a noble pal-

adin  who  fended  off  a  quintet  of  kir-lanans  that  attacked  a

temple of Torm has been making the rounds of the taverns in

Baldurs Gate. Talespinners there say that the paladin had the

better of her foes, until one of them called forth a number of

undead  from  the  temples  nearby  graveyard.  The  shambling

horde of animated corpses overwhelmed the paladin.

As these and other stories spread, the fear grows. Some good

folk, fearing attack, now carry arms as they make their way to

places  of  worship.  Druids  and  rangers  of  the  Silver  Marches

comb the wilderness for signs of the creatures, hoping to pre-

vent  attacks  that  the  fledgling  confederation  can  ill  afford.

Some  adventurers  who  have  actually  encountered  kir-lanans

and lived to tell the tale have shared information that, while

not  complete,  seems  at  least  consistent  with  other  corrobo-

rated evidence. These folk have established that the following

facts about the godless are probably true.

The kir-lanans hate deities. This seems the universally defin-

ing characteristic of the creatures (another feature that they

dont  share  with  normal  gargoyles).  In  battle  they  almost

always  prefer  to  attack  divine  spellcasters  before  any  other

foes, but any creature that venerates a deity seems fair game.

Given the prevalence and importance of religion in the daily

life of Faern, the kir-lanans consider just about every other

race as their hated enemies.

The individual creatures refer to themselves collectively as

kir-lanans.  They  never  elaborate  on  what  this  term  might

mean  in  any  other  tongue,  however,  and  none  outside  their

race  have  yet  mastered  the  harsh,  almost  guttural,  language

the creatures use. A few adventurers report that at least some

kir-lanans speak a few words of Common, though their speech

is heavily accented. No hints or clues exist to their tongues ori-

gins,  implying  strongly  that  it  was  never  spoken  in  Faern

until their arrival. Likewise, there is no mention of a creature

matching their description in any of the numerous houses of

learning scattered across the land. Hoping to shed some light

on the mystery of the kir-lanan language, the scholars of Can-

dlekeep  have  searched  diligently  for  some  hint  or  clue,  but

were unable to unearth anything even remotely helpful.

The  kir-lanans  are  notoriously  reticent  to  discuss  their

worldview, apart from confirming that they do indeed despise

deities and the worshipers of deities. A few resourceful and for-

tunate adventurers have gleaned in limited conversation with

kir-lanans  the  fact  that  the  creatures  have  no  patron  deity,

making them a rarity among the intelligent races of Faern

on  that  basis  alone.  The  creatures  have  implied  that  it  isnt

necessarily  religion  itself  that  angers  them,  but  rather  their

own inability to participate in it. Their universal term for all

other races translates into Common as godslaves.

It  is  thought  that  the  number  of  creatures  appearing  ini-

tially was relatively small. But either those reports were wildly

inaccurate, or the total number of kir-lanans has been steadily

increasing. The tiny number of creatures that arrived in Faern

during the Godswar simply could not perpetrate attacks in so

many widespread locations. Either the creatures are breeding,

or someoneor somethingis causing their numbers to swell.

The Kir-Lanans

The Organization

The  kir-lanans  chaotic  nature  has  made  it  difficult  for  the

race to organize effectively at a level beyond the small groups

in which they hunt and travel. Despite this, a few individual

kir-lanans  have  learned  to  think  differently,  and  as  the  race

evolves they have made some inroads toward acting in greater

concert.

Headquarters: None.

Members: About 4,000 (and growing fast).

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: None.

Religion: See text.

Alignment: CE.

Secrecy: None.

Symbol: The kir-lanans use no symbol as a race, and their

smaller groups use no identifying marks. A number of kir-

lanans speak Common, if badly, but whether or not they can

write it remains a mystery. Likewise, if the creatures possess

a  written  alphabet  of  their  own,  none  have  seen  any  evi-

dence of it.

HIERARCHY

The  kir-lanans  numbers  are  still  small  compared  to  most

races, and the creatures are somewhat resistant to an organized

societal structure. They gather in small bands, dubbed wings

by adventurers, usually numbering from two to five individu-

als. Larger groups have been reported, particularly in the Shin-

ing South, and a ranger in the High Forest claims to have seen

a flight of at least six dozen of the creatures in the sky over-

head, moving southward at great speed shortly after the begin-

ning of the new year.

The  strongest,  fiercest  specimen  leads  each  wing.  Any

member of the wing is free to challenge the current leader for

rulership of the band at any time, making for sudden and dra-

matic power shifts. Some of the energy and time that the kir-

lanans  might  otherwise  direct  against  Faernians  is  spent

resolving  these  challenges.  A  fight  to  the  death  settles  the

contest, and the only known witness to a kir-lanan leadership

challenge (a sage from the city of Suzail who risked her life to

get close enough to observe the wings ritualistic combat) de-

scribed it as a dance of brutal savagery. A wing leader can

never let down his guard or rest on his laurels if he wishes to

remain in charge for long. He must constantly prove himself

fit for leadership by being the first to strike and the fiercest

in battle. Gender has no impact on wing leadership; there are

roughly  as  many  female  wing  leaders  as  there  are  males.

Membership  in  a  wing  shifts  constantly  as  individual  kir-

lanans leave and join.

The Eyes

Adventurers have told of encounters with solitary kir-lanans

that did not attack, but rather observed the party from high in

the  air,  only  to  flee  if  confronted.  A  sizable  number  of  kir-

lanansperhaps  as  many  as  a  quarter  of  the  total  popula-

tionare  solitary  creatures,  living  apart  from  all  others  of

their  ilk.  They  do  not  join  wings  and  actively  avoid  contact

with their fellows, departing an area if more kir-lanans arrive.

Among the kir-lanans, these solitary creatures occupy a spe-

cial niche. They are called in their own tongue the Valrak, or

the  eyes.  The  Valrak  make  it  their  business  to  explore  the

lands of Faern, studying the people and cultures of this world

into which the kir-lanans were so rudely thrust. The Valrak ob-

serve so that the bulk of the race is free to continue to engage

in  acts  of  vengeance  against  deities.  The  Valrak  impart  the

knowledge  they  gain  to  other  members  of  their  race  when

called to a rookery (see below). They are particularly interested

in matters of a religious nature for obvious reasons, but they

have also attempted to learn something of Faerns different

cultures,  languages,  and  races,  and  also  its  rich  history.  The

eyes may be found in nearly any location, from the North to

the  Unapproachable  East,  from  wilderness  to  sprawling  city.

Most major cities in Faern have at least one member of the

Valrak,  and  a  few  of  the  largest  metropolises  boast  several.

Valrak kir-lanans always advance as rogues.

The Voice

A vital part of kir-lanan society is the Kivar, or the voice.

These important figures might be the heart and soul of the

race,  for  they  keep  the  fires  of  fanaticism  burning  in  the

kir-lanans collective breast. Before a planned raid or attack,

the  Kivar  gather  the  wing  or  wings  together  to  remind

them of their grand purpose: making war on deities. Travel-

ing from wing to wing, the Kivar employ a number of de-

vices  ranging  from  narratives  of  past  victories  to  verses

enumerating  the  deities  many  faults,  all  of  which  are  de-

signed to incite the kir-lanans to a fever pitch of anger and

bloodlust.  Likewise,  the  Kivar  often  fly  with  a  wing  (or

group of wings) to the attack, using their special talents to

inspire the kir-lanans as they carry the fight to the enemy.

As such, the Kivars function is almost spiritualan irony

not lost on the godless kir-lanans.

More intelligent than the majority of their fellows, the

kir-lanans  who  became  the  Kivar  planned  their  roles  with

some  forethought  and  care.  The  first  probably  patterned

themselves  after  bards  they  observed  rallying  adventuring

parties  or  entertaining  in  taverns.  Little  by  little,  the  kir-

lanans  developed  their  own  verse  and  chant  styles,  and

found them to be useful not only for recording the deeds of

their  race  but  for  keeping  it  focused  on  the  greater  goal.

When  several  wings  gather  to  achieve  an  objective  greater

than what a single wing can accomplish, it is almost always

because a Kivar has been successful in uniting the kir-lanans

for the purpose. Several Kivar have even been successful at

establishing  loose  alliances  with  other  groups  in  Faern,

something that most who have encountered the fanatic kir-

lanans  would  not  have  thought  possible.  Kivar  advance  as

fighter/bards.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The kir-lanans began existence with a single goal: punish the

deities by desecrating their temples and extinguishing all their

godslaves. This is still the ultimate goal of the race, but the kir-

lanans have modified their approach considerably. Their initial

strategy  in  pursuit  of  the  grand  goal  was  simple.  They  were

prepared to attack and slay every divine spellcaster, religious

leader, or worshiper of any deity in all of Faern, one by one.

However, it became apparent even to the most fanatical mem-

bers  of  the  race  that  these  tactics  would  accomplish  little

except the slow attrition of their numbers.

Kir-lanans attack a hated godslave

The members of the emerging Kivar caste were the first

to  recognize  that  both  information  about  the  world  and  a

different set of tactics would be necessary. It was they who

convinced  the  kir-lanans  that  some  members  of  the  race

should  separate  from  the  wings  and  go  into  the  world  to

learn  what  they  could.  This  is  how  the  Valrak  were  con-

ceived and born. The Kivar hoped that by better understand-

ing this world, they could devise strategies that would enable

the kir-lanans to realize victory over the deities and give the

race a chance to triumph. Their plan has proven successful,

at  least  in  that  it  has  allowed  the  creatures  to  plan  their

raids and attacks more carefully. But the Kivar came to un-

derstand that even more changes would be required, even if

the process was slow and painful in the face of the generally

chaotic kir-lanan nature.

RECRUITING

The kir-lanans are unable to breed with any outside their own

race,  and  so  cannot  recruit  more  members  in  that  fashion.

While some have accepted that temporary alliances with cer-

tain  godslaves  might  be  necessary  for  the  greater  kir-lanan

good,  none  are  ready  to  welcome  other  creatures  into  their

community.  But  alliances,  once  impossible  due  to  the  kir-

lanans fanatical refusal to even communicate with godslaves,

are rapidly becoming another matter under the guidance and

direction of the Kivar caste.

Slowly, cautiously, the Kivar have advanced the idea that

the  kir-lanans  have  everything  to  gain  by  forging  alliances

with  other  humanoid  groups.  This  concept  was  met  at  first

with  near  total  resistance,  but  graduallyas  information

gathered  by  the  Valrak  has  trickled  into  the  rookeriesthe

idea  is  making  sense.  To  the  surprise  of  the  kir-lanans,  they

discovered that some Faernian natives give little more than

lip service to deities, preferring to devote themselves to more

important  agendas  and  pursuits.  Among  these  groups,  the

Arcane Brotherhood, the Knights of the Shield, and the Iron

Throne have proven the most compatible with the kir-lanan

outlook. All these groups desire power, but none of them are

particularly  interested  in  doing  so  in  the  name  of  a  patron

deity. While some individual members of these organizations

may venerate patron deities, their beliefs dont seem to have

detracted  from  their  ability  to  help  their  societies  achieve

their goals.

The Kivar have thus been able to convince several wings

to swallow their distaste and work jointly with these groups

on limited occasions. One wing recently joined with a contin-

gent  of  Iron  Throne  agents  who  sacked  a  caravan  carrying

supplies  destined  for  a  remote  temple  of  Oghma.  Another

aided the Arcane Brotherhood in conducting a thorough re-

connaissance of a druid grove near the community of Dead-

snows in the Silver Marches; the wing has agreed to help the

Brotherhood destroy the grove in the near future. All the al-

liances  forged  thus  far  are  admittedly  temporary,  and  the

Kivar know that they must be cautious. It takes only one mis-

take in their choice of allies to forever sour the entire race on

the whole idea.

The Kivar hope that when the kir-lanans see how effective

such alliances of convenience can truly be, they are more ac-

cepting of the idea. They have hopes that, in the near future,

some  wings  might  even  permit  (very)  temporary  alliances

The Kir-Lanans

with  those  who  worship  certain  deities,  such  as  Cyric.  The

Kivar cannot help but be in complete agreement with Shars

desire to war on the other deities, and they are not opposed to

working alongside her clergy for that very purpose. And when

that happens, the Kivar know that the deities themselves are

going to tremble at the havoc the kir-lanans shall wreak. If the

Kivar are successful in this plan, only Shar would eventually

be left, and by then the kir-lanans power should be too great

for her to do anything other than submit meekly to her death

at the hands of her one-time ally.

Encounters

Statistics for individual members of the kir-lanan race can be

found in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. As stated

therein, a typical encounter with kir-lanans consists of a wing

with from two to five members.

Kir-Lanan  Varlak  Encounter  (EL  6):  1  kir-lanan  Varlak

(CE Rog4).

Kir-Lanan  Wing  Encounter  (EL  10): 1  kir-lanan  wing

leader (NE Ftr3/Sor2), 3 kir-lanan warriors (CE Ftr2), 1 kir-

lanan Kivar (CN Ftr2/Brd3).

Kir-lanan Rookery

Deep in the subtropical Gulthmere Forest is a chain of extinct

volcanoes. Under the water-filled caldera of this particular vol-

cano lies a series of caves created by the movement of magma

and  superheated  steam  and  water  throughout  the  millennia.

The kir-lanans have adopted the site for one of their rookeries,

where they go to mate and give birth to their young during the

autumn of every year. It is one of perhaps two dozen similar

sites located throughout Faern.

ROOKERY LAYOUT

1. Approach Tunnel

The kir-lanans use this opening in the side of the volcano as

their chief means of ingress and egress. The outer surface of

the tunnel is little more than a narrow cleft in the mountain-

side, created eons ago by pressurized magma and steam escap-

ing to the surface from the depths of the earth. The tunnels

mouth is approximately 14 feet across and 8 feet high, and the

tunnel narrows rapidly to a width of only 10 feetjust wide

enough for a kir-lanan to glide through its length safely. At

the point where the tunnel narrows to its smallest width, an il-

lusory wall hides the continuation of the passage. The exterior

tunnel mouth is too small and situated in too sheltered a spot

to  be  seen  from  a  distance  greater  than  a  few  dozen  yards

away, and even then a character looking for the opening must

make a successful Search check (DC 18). Two kir-lanan guards

(see  area  4)  are  stationed  just  behind  the  lip  of  the  tunnel

mouth, watching the mountainside and the skies for signs of

intruders. A successful Spot check (DC 16) enables a character

to notice the guards.

The Kir-Lanans

case the rookery comes under attack by a foe that the gathered

kir-lanans cannot defeat. It is also a lookout station, and two

kir-lanan guards are stationed here at all times while the rook-

ery is in use.

The tunnel shaft rises from the Chamber of the Voice (area

10) almost straight up to a height of over 200 feet. The tunnel

is 2030 feet wide for its entire length. The tunnel mouth is

located a short distance from the shore of the caldera lake. At

the surface it resembles a natural lava vent or sinkhole hidden

by  thick-growing  brush.  It  can  be  detected  with  a  successful

Spot check (DC 15) from a distance of 100 feet or less.

Creatures (EL 6): Kir-lanan Ftr2 (2).

Tactics:  If  the  guards  spot  intruders,  one  continues  to  ob-

serve  them  while  the  other  flies  to  alert  the  complex  that

danger  is  near.  The  route  that  the  flying  guard  takes  is  nor-

mally areas 10, 9, 4, 7, and 8, in that order (kir-lanans from

area 10 alert anyone in area 11). Combat atop the tunnel does

not draw attention from the kir-lanans below, but any fighting

in the tunnel within 50 feet of area 11 alerts the kir-lanans in

that area.

3. Steam Vent

A plume of steam, warmed by the active lava far below, rises

from  this  narrow  crack  in  the  mountainside.  Too  small  for

the kir-lanans to navigate in flight, a Medium-size or Small

character  could  nevertheless  climb  down  (or  up)  the  vent

(Climb  check  DC  15).  However,  a  character  descending  the

vent  is  faced  with  a  serious  problem  when  he  reaches  the

bottom. The shaft ends in the ceiling of a vast natural cavern

(area  11),  directly  above  a  mass  of  active,  bubbling  magma.

The superheated magma sheds a dull red glow in a radius of

150 feet, illuminating part of the cavern and the lowest 50

feet of the tunnel.

Characters descending the steep vent by hand or rope must

either  climb  down  the  cavern  wall  (Climb  check  DC  25)  or

invent  a  means  to  swing  themselves  down  to  the  cave  floor.

Characters who fall into the lava suffer 20d6 points of damage

per round of exposure. Half damage from the magma contin-

ues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases.

4. Guard Post

Six kir-lanan guards occupy this cavern, ever alert and watch-

ful for intruders. Two guards position themselves just behind

the rocky outcropping of the tunnel mouth where it meets the

mountainside,  so  that  they  can  scan  both  the  mountain  and

sky for intruders (see area 1).

Creatures (EL 6): Kir-lanan Ftr2 (2).

Tactics: If the guards spot intruders approaching on foot

up  the  mountainside,  one  of  them  flies  down  the  approach

tunnel to alert the other four guards stationed in this cave. In

turn, one of these guards flies through the remainder of the

complex,  calling  out  a  warning  to  the  other  kir-lanans.  The

guards warning route is normally this sequence of areas: 7, 8,

9, 10, 11.

If the intruders spot the approach tunnel, one guard flies

out to attack and distract them while the other conducts his

warning  flight;  in  that  instance,  the  four  guards  in  the

cavern below fly up to defend the entrance. Once area 9 is

alerted,  reinforcements  arrive  at  the  approach  tunnel  in

1d3 rounds.

5. Food Stores

An  atrocious  smell,  easily  identifiable  as  the  strong  odor  of

blood and meat, is detectable 100 feet away from the mouth of

this cave. Within its rocky confines is a supply of freshly killed

game. All manner of jungle animals, from wild pigs to great

apes, are strewn about the cavern floor in various states of dis-

memberment. The kir-lanans (whose diet consists of fresh, un-

cooked  meat)  require  prodigious  amounts  of  food  during  the

mating and birthing times, so this larder is kept well stocked.

6. Holding Cell

Intruders that the kir-lanans capture and wish to keep alive for

any length of time, for questioning or torture, end up at the

bottom of this dank cave. Water runs down the cave walls in

slow,  mineral-laden  rivulets,  gradually  filling  the  cave.  Cur-

rently the water level has reached a depth of 2 feet, but cen-

turies will pass before the cave is completely full at this rate.

The  water  renders  the  cavern  walls  very  difficult  to  climb

The Rookeries

Unlike most creatures that congregate into small groups or

packs, kir-lanans do not live or travel in family groups. The

individual members of each wing are not necessarily related

to one another, although they may be by happenstance. They

conceal their mating practices from the eyes of other races.

For all anyone knows, the kir-lanans might lay eggs, bear live

young,  or  reproduce  spontaneously  by  dividing  in  two.  But

given the lack of any direct observation of young specimens,

coupled  with  the  undeniable  fact  that  the  total  number  of

creatures is on the rise, it seems clear to everyone that the

kir-lanans must be engaging in some method of procreation.

From  time  to  time,  prompted  by  reasons  and  conditions

known only to the kir-lanans, individual members of the race

leave  their  wings  and  journey  to  a  mating  ground.  These

rookeries  are  almost  always  subterranean,  consisting  of  a

series of interlocking or connected natural caverns. Here the

kir-lanans choose mates, remaining until the young are born

(typically  three  months  from  the  time  of  conception).  All

the adults participate in raising all the young, taking turns

hunting  for  sustenance  and  teaching  the  offspring  how  to

fly, hunt, and fight. There appear to be no parent-child rela-

tionships among the creatures. All the adults in the rookery

teach the young as a group. Kir-lanans mature rapidly, gain-

ing their full size in as little as two months. Once they are

fully  grown,  most  kir-lanans  join  a  wingseemingly  at

randomand begin their lifelong war of hatred against the

godslaves.

Even the rogue kir-lanan are part of the cycle of mating

and birth, taking their turns in the rookeries without suffer-

ing any sort of discrimination or stigma.

(Climb check DC 30), and the water is quite cold and uncom-

fortable  to  stand  or  sit  in  as  well.  The  skeletal  remains  of  a

dozen  or  so  humanoidselves,  dwarves,  orcs,  and  humans

litter the narrow floor under the water, indicating that the kir-

lanans  left  some  prisoners  here  to  rot  when  the  creatures

abandoned the rookery at the end of the birthing time.

7. Mating Chamber

When the rookery is in use, this cavern is used by the dozens of

kir-lanans who come here to mate. A small number (2d4) of

the creatures are always here.

8. Birthing Chamber

A female kir-lanan continues to take her turn at guard duty

and in hunting for food during her pregnancy, until approxi-

mately two or three weeks before giving birth. Then the preg-

nant female retires to this chamber, which is made warm and

comfortable  by  the  addition  of  soft  grasses  and  palm  fronds

from  the  jungle  below,  and  rocks  heated  near  the  boiling

magma  in  the  Chamber  of  Voices  (area  11).  During  the

birthing time, 2d6 female kir-lanans are here, as well as 1d4

male and female kir-lanan attendants.

9. Chamber of the Eyes

When the Varlak come to the rookery, they remain in this

huge cavern to share among themselves the information and

news they have gathered in the time they have spent out in

the  world.  The  Kivar  visit  them  here,  listening  and  asking

many  questions  about  the  Varlaks  understanding  of  what

they  have  witnessed.  During  the  birthing  time,  2d4  Varlak

kir-lanans are always in this chamber, and usually 1d4 Kivar

as well.

When  the  young  are  born,  the  Varlak  are  the  fledglings

first caregivers. The kir-lanan mother brings her newborn to

this chamber soon after giving birth and entrusts it to the care

of  the  eyes.  The  young  remain  here  for  a  period  of  approxi-

mately a month,  during which time they  are  given the  very

best care. The mothers are permitted to rejoin the children at

the end of this period, and the young are then reared jointly by

their mothers and the Varlak. The Kivar visit the children pe-

riodically during this time as well, indoctrinating them in the

fanaticism of their elders. By the time the young are ready to

join  a  wing,  they  have  received  sufficient  information  about

the world to allow them a decent chance of survival if they are

ever separated from their wing.

10. Chamber of Wings

Male and female members of kir-lanan wings, when they are

not  engaged  in  mating,  guarding,  or  hunting,  occupy  this

chamber. While not very deep, the chamber is quite broad

nearly  300  feet  across  at  its  widest  pointgiving  the  con-

tentious  kir-lanans  ample  wing  room.  Generally,  1d10+10

kir-lanans are here at any given time. The rest are in the guard

areas, in the mating or birthing chambers, or out hunting for

food. The kir-lanans use this space for resting, eating, talking,

and fighting for leadership of the wings.

11. Chamber of Voices

In  this  broad,  deep  cavern,  the  Kivar  gather  to  discuss  their

views  on  the  future  of  their  race.  They  share  information

about recent raids and attacks on the godslaves, debate the suc-

cess of various tactics, and plan for later endeavors. The rela-

tive merits and flaws of various organizations and societies is

also a popular topic, as is the latest information obtained by

the Varlak. In caverns just such as these, all across Faern, the

future of the kir-lanan race is determined. During the birthing

time, 2d4 Kivar are present here at any given time.

The Knights

of the Shield

The silk merchant stood before Tannus, his eyes downcast as he

spoke. And so you see, Tannus, I have no one else to turn but to

you. Will you help me?

Tannus regarded the merchant and smiled at him benevo-

lently.  It  was  indeed  too  bad  that  Klemms  shipment  of  rare

and exotic silks was lost to bandits on the road to Amn. Would

Klemm feel better if he knew the silks were not moldering by

the  roadside,  but  stored  in  the  safety  of  one  of  Tannuss  own

storerooms? Doubtful, highly doubtful.

Klemm, my good man. Of course I will help you! Weve all

been in your shoes before, and I know how important it is to you

that  your  associates  in  Amn  receive  their  mechandise,  the

Knight of the Shield said.

Tannus continued his pitch to his unwitting client. Now, I

do  happen  to  have  some  silk  on  hand.  Ill  have  to  charge  you

more for it than I usually would, but only because I have sev-

eral other parties interested in the silk, and they wont be happy

when they find out its no longer available. But seeing as how

you are a friend in need, I am willing to give you preferential

treatment in this case. Is this acceptable to you?

The  silk  merchant  had  no  choice  but  to  pay  the  price,  and

Tannus knew it. If Klemm didnt deliver the silks to Amn as

promised, he would be in a lot more trouble than he could get

into  by  emptying  his  strongbox  to  fill  Tannuss  already  over-

flowing coffers.

The  Knights  of  the  Shield  is  a  loose  network  of  nobles  and

merchants who share information so that they may each exert

influence in their chosen areas of interest. The members of the

order are for the most part entirely self-interested. They could

use the information gained from the organization for the bet-

terment  of  lives  and  livelihoods  in  many  lands,  but  they

choose  instead  to  employ  it  in  gaining  political  leverage  and

personal advantage.

Many of the knights are legitimate aristocrats and traders

who see no harm in acquiring the odd bit of useful informa-

tion. For many of them, their association with the knighthood

is more a matter of family tradition and convenience rather

than conscious decision.

Other members, however, are not so casual about their af-

filiation  with  the  order.  For  them,  their  knighthood  comes

first and foremost, for it is the key that unlocks all the per-

sonal  power  and  wealth  they  crave.  And  there  exists  yet  an-

other  layer  of  membership,  unknown  to  the  other  two:  an

inner cabal of knights who serve the true power of the order

a being dedicated to spreading its own brand of cruelty and po-

litical corruption across Faern.

The Knights of the Shield

Brief History

The knights can trace the origin of their order back more than

fifteen centuries. Their original purpose was to provide intelli-

gence to the monarchy of Tethyr during the Eye Tyrant Wars

of 170 DR. They took their name from the fabled Shield of

Silvam,  an  artifact  that  was  reputedly  crafted  by  the  wizard

Zhyra Bardson-Ithal. The artifact was lost, though history does

not record the time or place of its disappearance. Perhaps not

coincidentally,  the  knights  were  officially  disbanded  shortly

after the shield vanished (about three hundred years after the

orders  founding),  when  they  were  falsely  accused  of  taking

part in the murder of King Leodom IV of Tethyr.

The Organization

The knights guard their secrets carefully, despite the fact that

their  organizational  structure  is  quite  loose  and  informal,

except for the Shield Council. Separated by geography as they

are, the members rarely ever meet more than a half-dozen of

their fellows during their entire lifetimes. Ancient bylaws stip-

ulate that each knight may inform no more than three indi-

viduals,  regardless  of  identity,  that  he  is  a  member  of  the

order, and this rule remains in effect today. None of the mem-

bers outside the Shield Council are aware that the orders lead-

ership is not what it appears to be.

Headquarters: Inselm Hhunes palatial manse in the city of

tablishing many of the traditions and practices that have

endured  to  the  present  day.  By  sharing  vital  eco-

nomic,  political,  and  historical  information

gathered by themselves and their agents, the

nobles  were  able  to  make  exceptionally

wise investment, trade, and political deci-

sions  that  increased  their  personal

wealth  and  enabled  them  to  remain

several  steps  ahead  of  rivals.  Inviting

only a handful of their fellow nobles to

join  the  order  every  few  years,  the

Knights of the Shield remained a rela-

tively  tiny  organization  with  modest

aims until the year 889 DR, when Duke

Tithkar Illehhune joined the society.

The duke brought with his membership a

wondrous,  magnificently  jeweled  shield,  which

he referred as the Shield of the Hidden Lord, that

bore a menacing visage worked into its face. He persuaded

his fellow knights that the shield was a gift from the deities,

meant as a sign that the Knights of the Shield should restore

themselves  to  their  former  glory.  Duke  Illehhune  and  his

cronies established a secret inner circle of knights for the pur-

pose  of  increasing  the  orders  power  and  influence.  Calling

themselves the Shield Council, this inner cabal undertook the

task of restoring the Knights of the Shield to the success and

power it had known in its formative years.

In the five centuries that have followed, the Knights of the

Shield has indeed waxed prosperous. Though still relatively few

in  number,  its  membership  includes  many  of  the  best  in-

formed  and  most  successful  aristocrats  and  traders  in  its

sphere of influence, which today includes most of the Sword

Coast as well as Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr. The group has

used its network of spies, informants, and gossips to influence

events of economic, social, and military nature, including the

creation  of  important  trade  roads,  the  defeat  of  the  Black

Horde  (1235  DR),  the  establishment  or  relaxation  of  innu-

merable trade tariffs and mercantile policies, and the reestab-

lishment of Tethyrs monarchy during the Reclamation Wars

(13661369 DR). All these events have benefited members of

the Knights of the Shield and the Shield Council immensely,

mostly by adding to their personal stores of wealth and politi-

cal power. As far as the majority of the members of the order

are  concerned,  thats  the  entirety  of  the  organizations  goals

and ambitions. They are mistaken.

Members: 60100, plus three or four times as many

agents.

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: Inselm Hhune, First Lord of the

Shield Council.

Religion: Gargauth the Outcast (see text).

Alignment: CN, LE, NE.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: A  circular  shield  with  a

central  eye,  surrounded  by  a  circle  of

diamonds.

The  Knights  of  the  Shield  mint  their

own currency. They use as their tender a

thick gold coin, as heavy as three standard

gold coins. Each coin is stamped on one side

with the orders mark. The coins are minted at

a facility owned by the order, located in Athkatla.

HIERARCHY

Seven knights make up the membership of the Shield Council.

They meet periodically, never in the same place twice, in order

to chart the direction of the order and coordinate its members

activities.  Four  of  the  members  of  the  council  are  merely

senior knights who have dedicated much of their lives to the

order, doing what is best for themselves and the organization

often at the expense of ethics. However, the remaining three

membersthe First Lord of the Shield, the Second Lord of

the Shield, and the First Lady of the Shieldserve the order

only as a means to increase the power of their dark master, the

Hidden Lord of the Shield.

The Hidden Lord of the Shield

Lord Tithkar Illehhunes artifact is still with the Knights of

the Shieldin fact, it now leads the organization. The shield is

an artifact sacred to the deity Gargauth, a cruel minor power

whose portfolio includes betrayal, cruelty, political corruption,

and  power  brokers.  Gargauth  speaks  directly  through  the

shield.  By  carefully  manipulating  the  members  of  the  Shield

Council for centuries, imparting to them valuable snippets of

information that they used to the orders benefit, Gargauth en-

couraged the members of the council to venerate the artifact

and treat it as the Hidden Lord of the order. Patiently, he has

manipulated the Shield Council members year after year, be-

coming more and more essential to the orders success. Now he

has  usurped  their  leadership  and  become  the  knights  true

master.  Fortunately,  he  has  the  perfect  tool  in  the  current

First Lord of the Shield, the insatiably power-hungry Inselm

Hhune. With this greedy mortals cooperation, Gargauth has

installed his own clergy on the Shield Council. Now he is in a

position to start dictating the activities of the order directly.

As far as the majority of the Shield Council members are

concerned, the Hidden Lord of the Shield is a strange intelli-

gence that dwells in the shield itself. They respect its authority

and wisdom, considering it the nominal head of the order. The

council  would  not  dream  of  making  an  important  decision

without first consulting the Hidden Lord, much as one might

consult an oracle or a Talis deck for insight into an important

personal  matter.  The  Hidden  Lord  does  not  always  speak  to

the council even when asked, and on such occasions the council

takes the Hidden Lords silence as a sign that it approves of

whatever decision the council cares to make. On the rare occa-

sions  when  the  Hidden  Lord  makes  its  opinion  known,  how-

ever,  the  Shield  Council  is  quick  to  follow  its  advice  to  the

letter, for it has never proven to be wrong. The Second Lord

of the Shield, Ghauntz, is the official Speaker for the Hidden

Lord,  since  he  has  demonstrated  an  uncanny  ability  to  deci-

pher and interpret the beings sometimes cryptic utterances.

The First Lord of the Shield

The  impossibly  fat  Duke  Inselm  Hhune  of  Kamlann  (NE

male  human  Exp10)  cultivates  a  pleasant  demeanor,  but  his

heart is as black as his hair, and his ambition is greater even

than his waistline. He is an indirect descendant of the Tethyr-

ian  noble  who  discovered  the  Shield  of  the  Hidden  Lord,

though he was himself born a common merchant. He excelled

at his trade by virtue of a quick mind, and through the combi-

nation of this acumen and carefully disguised but ruthless am-

bition, he amassed a fortune so large he was able to purchase

the title of lord. Invited to join the Knights of the Shield soon

thereafter,  he  rose  quickly  through  the  ranks  to  sit  on  the

Shield Council only five years after becoming a member (aided

by the mysterious deaths of several regular knights and one

member  of  the  Shield  Council,  with  the  help  of  the  Fire

Knives and the Night Masks).

A political intriguer and social climber without peer, Inselm

gives his loyalty only as a calculated loan, to be recalled when his

allies are no longer useful. The only interests that he cares about

are his own. His personal wealth is immense and his land holdings

vast,  though  most  are  owned  by  his  agents  and  nominees  so

that his enemies and rivals do not know the full extent of his re-

sources. The crown of Tethyr has rewarded Inselm handsomely

for his services in recent years. He seems to know everything that

happens  in  the  South  and  along  the  Sword  Coast,  a  talent  he

chalks up publicly to his business dealings but that stems in actu-

ality from his membership in the Knights of the Shield.

Since Inselms ascension to the Shield Council, Gargauth has

singled him out as the principal target of his machinations. Be-

coming the First Lord granted Inselm the privilege of caring

for the Shield of the Hidden Lord: Each time he handled the

artifact, Gargauth whispered to him, encouraging him to act

upon his cruelest and most base instincts. Already a man with

few morals, Inselm rarely hesitated to take the Hidden Lords

advice,  committing  acts  of  treachery  and  murder  whenever

prompted  by  the  whispers  of  the  deity.  Soon  Gargauth  had

Inselm completely under his thumb.

The Knights of the Shield

The Second Lord of the Shield

Ghauntz the Cloaked (LE male human Clr15 of Gargauth) is

an  elderly,  scarred  man  who  is  rarely  seen  without  his  dark

robes and hooded cloak. He has venerated and served his deity

for the better part of his adult life. He gained membership in

the order through his deitys manipulations and came to his

seat on the Shield Council through similar means. Now that

he is one of the rulers of the order, he works to ensure that his

deitys will is understood and enacted. The other members of

the Shield Council respect Ghauntzs role as the Speaker for

the Hidden Lord. They believe him to be nothing more than

a sharp-minded moneylender who is gifted at understanding

the Hidden Lords true meaning, unaware that he actually re-

ceives communication directly from Gargauth.

The First Lady of the Shield

Duchess Lucia Thione-Hhune (CE female human Exp7) is a

distant cousin of the royal house of Tethyr. She married Duke

Inselm Hhune three years ago in a bid to regain her position

among the knights, which she had forfeited during an embar-

rassing  and  ill-fated  debacle  in  which  she  attempted  to  seize

control of the city of Waterdeep. The chestnut-haired beauty

was exiled from the City of Splendors for her crimes and lost

her standing among the knights both for her failure and for

deceiving the membership.

Inselm  skillfully  maneuvered  to  rebuild  his  wifes  lost

status, and just this year managed to bring her into the Shield

Council (with the aid of Ghauntz and the Hidden Lord). He

did not do so out of a sense of duty or love, however. Theirs is

a marriage of political convenience, and neither of them has

any  illusions  about  the  others  fidelity.  Inselm  plans  to  in-

doctrinate Lucia into the worship of Gargauth, so that she

too may aid the Hidden Lord in increasing his control over

the  order.  For  her  own  part,  Lucia  has  yet  to  hear  the

Hidden Lord speak, but she has seen what Inselms associa-

tion with the artifact and its master have done for him. It is

unlikely that she will refuse any chance to increase her own

personal power.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The methods employed by the Knights of the Shield are ac-

tually  quite  simple.  When  a  member  hears  something  that

could be of potential use to a fellow member or the order as

a  whole,  he  conveys  it  to  the  Shield  Council.  The  council

members in turn coordinate and analyze the incoming infor-

mation, redistributing it to the members who in their opin-

ion can make the best use of it. Most of the members use the

information thus gained to feather their own nests, improve

their  political  standing,  or  take  advantage  of  economic

trends and events. A knight might inform the Shield Council,

for  example,  that  the  wheat  crop  of  a  certain  community

looks as though it might yield less than anticipated at the up-

coming harvest. The council might pass this information on

to another member who has interests in the wheat trade; that

member could then act quickly to capitalize on the harvest

shortfall,  making  a  tidy  profit  and  cutting  his  competitors

out of that particular market. The Shield Council receives a

dozen bits of information just like this every day. Taken indi-

vidually, these pieces of datasome little better than court

gossipmay mean relatively little. When viewed as a whole,

they constitute a most thorough picture of matters that are

of great interest to anyone wishing to gain certain types of

advantages.

The knights generally work, as a group, within the letter of

the law when pursuing their information-gathering activities.

A  member  usually  cultivates  a  network  of  informants  from

among his social and business contacts, and many do not hesi-

tate to use their own friends and family as potential sources of

information. Some members of the order are not above taking

the  law  into  their  own  hands  in  order  to  achieve  goals  they

consider  more  important  than  the  sanctity  of  local  statutes.

But the order has had tremendous success in applying political

and economic pressure to actually alter laws or repeal them al-

together,  which  is  a  much  safer  means  of  accomplishing  its

goals than committing criminal acts.

The knights are bound by an oath, handed down since the

orders  earliest  days,  to  undertake  no  activities  that  might

harm the organization or act contrary to the interest of its

members. However, it is not always possible to know when

any  given  act  impacts  a  fellow  knight  negatively,  so  a

system  of  apologetic  repayments  for  unintentional  infrac-

tions of this rule has been established over the years. When a

member inadvertently acts against the interests of a fellow

knight, he is expected to tender an immediate apology and a

prescribed  sum  in  either  cash  or  trade  goods  as  compensa-

tion. The Shield Council is the final arbiter of these matters.

Knights who attempt to cheat the order or their fellows out

of such a debt are normally among the organizations most

short-lived members.

The Shield Council

Unlike the regular knights, the members of the Shield Coun-

cil think nothing of laws or moralssuch matters are of no

concern to a true master of events. The council uses the in-

formation it receives from the constituent members to plan

and conduct assassinations, bribe political figures, blackmail

the wealthy, and conduct hostile takeovers of businesses in fi-

nancial difficulty. Sometimes they do their own dirty work,

but more often they contract out to other organizations and

societies,  such  as  the  Night  Masks,  the  Fire  Knives,  or

Shadow Thieves. They are not above dealing with the Zhen-

tarim,  the  Arcane  Brotherhood,  the  Red  Wizards,  or  any

other group that might be of use in pursuit of their goals. In

this fashion, they increase their own wealth and power, and

extend  that  of  the  order.  Because  Inselms  public  life  de-

mands  that  he  give  the  appearance  of  total  loyalty  to  his

native Tethyr, the order does not conduct any of its more un-

savory operations in that country. Moreover, Inselm utilizes

information gained through his position on the Shield Coun-

cil to aid Tethyrs monarchy.

The Hidden Lord

Gargauths chief aim in the short term is to gain more wor-

shipers  from  among  the  Knights  of  the  Shield.  He  has  en-

trusted Ghauntz with the task of spreading his gospel among

the  other  members  of  the  Shield  Council,  and  through

Inselm he intends to demonstrate his power by making the

First Lord even more successful. Currently he is working on

a plan that enables Inselm to get even closer to the monar-

chy of Tethyr, putting him in a position where he might be

The Kraken Society

able  to  make  a  claim  on  the  throne.  As  the  faith  of  the

knights  is  co-opted,  those  who  prove  resistant  can  be

drummed  out  of  the  order  and  replaced  with  those  more

pliant. Ultimately, Gargauth sees the knights as the founda-

tion of a sharp increase in the popularity of his religionand

therefore as a tool for the increase of his stature and power

among the deities.

RECRUITING

A  knight  may  sponsor  a  person,  of  any  race  or  gender,  for

membership in the order. The candidate must meet with the

Shield Council and, if found acceptable, swear the oaths of loy-

alty  and  secrecy  with  his  hand  on  the  Shield  of  the  Hidden

Lord. Those who fail to live up to their obligations may be cast

out  of  the  order  by  a  majority  vote  of  the  Shield  Council.

Those who dare to betray the order almost always die at the

hands of a hired assassin. Most of the new recruits come from

Amn, Calimshan, and the Sword Coast, where the orders mem-

bers are most numerous and its influence strongest. The vast

majority of them are members of the nobility, though a few

are immensely wealthy merchants.

Encounters

The  knights  do  not  maintain  any  standing  military  arm  or

body  of  agents  within  the  orders  structure,  except  for  those

servants who wait upon the members when they meet to dis-

cuss business. Each knight is responsible for creating and main-

taining his own personal network of informants. It is unlikely,

therefore, that characters will ever encounter a group of the

knights in the normal course of adventuring.

The Kraken Society

The  dockmaster  smiled  at  the  activities  below.  There  were

secret shipments being handled on his Waterdhavian dock with-

out his knowledge or permission. He would have to schedule a

talk with Captain Elmorn about the rudeness of trying to bypass

bribes to the dockmaster. And thank Meritid Archneie for the

information leading to this discovery. Perhaps the cleric of Um-

berlee could be useful after all.

The  Kraken  Society  is  a  group  of  information

brokers who use their knowledge to influence

events in coastal countries along the Track-

less Sea. Its agents, known as the Krake-

nar,  are  not  above  using  kidnapping,

murder,  and  torture  to  get  their  way.

Their  monstrous  leaders  goal  is  the

control of a great undersea and shore

kingdom  ranging  for  thousands  of

miles. Led by a very old kraken wizard

called  Slarkrethel,  the  society  has  ties

to the church of Umberlee and controls

armies  of  undersea  monsters,  which  it

uses to conquer hostile aquatic settlements

and raid shore-based ones.

Brief History

Upon discovering the ruins of Ascarle, an elven city destroyed

by  drow  and  submerged  by  the  northern  ice,  the  kraken

Slarkrethel learned of the former glories of his race and de-

sired to reclaim them. Over the centuries he created a network

of agents under the sea, strengthening his empire. Eventually

he rescued drowning sailors and offered them life in exchange

for loyalty as his agents on the shore, and from these strange

beginnings a powerful organization of information traders has

grown. Now the Kraken Society trades information for wealth,

influence, and favors, and has earned a reputation for assassi-

nation and other evil acts to further its agenda.

the Organization

The structure of the society is somewhat loose, and each level

within the organization is allowed to develop its own means of

acquiring information. This flexibility means that the best way

to uproot a particular cell varies widely, since each cell has dif-

ferent methods of handling and acquiring agents.

These statistics refer to the organization as a whole, which

spans much area both above and under the water.

Headquarters:  Ascarle  (underwater  city),  north  Trackless

Sea.

Members: Unknown, but assumed  to number hundreds of

agents across the North and the Western Heartlands, plus tens

of thousands of aquatic troops.

Hierarchy: Webbed.

Leader: Slarkrethel.

Religion: Umberlee, varies.

Alignment: NE, LE, N.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: The icon of the society is a purple squid with many

tentacles. This symbol is only worn openly in places where the

society holds absolute power, such as the city of Ascarle.

HIERARCHY

Slarkrethel cares little how his underlings organize themselves,

as long as the information flows. The general structure has the

kraken  at  the  head,  with  a  few  senior  agents  watching  over

large areas. These senior agents have their own groups of un-

derlings  that  watch  over  smaller  areas,  and  so  on.

Agents  are  allowed  to  use  their  own  methods  of

obtaining  information  as  long  as  the  results

are passed up through the ranks, after which

they can be distributed across the network.

Slarkrethel (NE  male  kraken  Wiz20,

Chosen of Umberlee) is the leader of the

Kraken Society. His trusted lieutenants

are  his  eyes  and  ears  to  the  remote

parts of his realm. He is always accom-

panied  by  a  retinue  of  bodyguards,  in-

cluding  weresharks,  merrow  (aquatic

ogres),  kapoacinth  (aquatic  gargoyles),

dire sharks, and orcas.

Vestress (LE  mind  flayer)  is  the  overseer

of Ascarle. Brought back from an undersea il-

lithid  colony  and  brainwashed  into  serving  the

kraken, it is an efficient master of its new home.

154

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  10:59 AM  Page 155

Malaugryms

The  Skum  Lord (LE  aboleth  Wiz11/Clr13  of  Umberlee)

lives  beneath  the  sewers  of  Skullport  and  is  said  to  own  as

much as forty percent of that citys buildings. It sends its skum

servitors into the city to collect rent and has many informants

within the city.

Rethnor (LE male human Ftr16/Rog7) is one of the five

High Captains of Luskan, and leads the societys coastal opera-

tions from the Mere of Dead Men northward.

Semmonemily  (N  doppelganger  Rog10)  watches  the

Dessarin River valley. The former servant of an illithid turned

lich, the shapechanger has many Underdark allies and receives

frequent updates from unusual sources.

Meritid  Archneie (CE  male  human  Clr6  of  Umberlee)

serves his church and the Skum Lord faithfully, gathering in-

formation  on  naval  traffic  for  his  aquatic  masters.  He  now

leads a small cell of Krakenar in Waterdeep.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

People join the Kraken Society for many reasons, all revolving

around the uses of information. Information can bring wealth,

personal power, or vengeance against ones enemies. The upper

ranks of the Krakenar are in it for the power, having become

accustomed to numerous underlings obeying their commands.

Slarkrethel himself wishes to eventually become a deity, and

has the support of Umberlee, who has named him her Chosen.

RECRUITING

The Krakenar are willing to trade for information from just

about anyone. If a person is proven to be a reliable source of in-

formation, he may eventually be shown more of the workings

of  the  society  and  encouraged  to  join  on  a  more  permanent

bases.  Theoretically,  anyone  sufficiently  well  informed  can

join  the  Kraken  Society.  Its  ranks  include  common  thieves,

wealthy merchants, and morally dubious adventurers.

ALLIES

In addition to the various intelligent monsters of the Trackless

Sea that would be happy to acquire treasure or favors from the

Kraken Society, the church of Umberlee is a strong ally, and

any Umberlant that is aware of the existence of the society can

be counted on to provide at least some aid to a needy Krakenar.

ENEMIES

Because of its tendency to pry into secret affairs, the Kraken

Society has drawn fire from similar groups such as the Harpers

and the Knights of the Shield. Since the Krakenar use violent

crime to acquire and protect their information, this behavior

has only increased the enmity of the Harpers and other good-

aligned groups.

Encounters

Because they come from all walks of life, no standard tactics

are used by members of the Kraken Society. Many agents seem

to favor water breathing spells and potions both as a means of

escape and to aid in ambushes and surveillance. The legions of

aquatic monsters that serve Slarkrethel are all practiced troops,

however, and know the best tactics for fighting underwater or

on the shore. Using spells to compel or lure foes into the water

is a common tactic when fighting in or from the water.

Malaugryms

But dont you agree, the voice purred from the shadows, that

prey tastes even better when spiced with the sweet tang of fear?

He turned, wanting at the last nothing more than to confront

the face of his death. Even as drained as he was from his ef-

forts to escape this . . . thing, he still had enough energy left for

shock. His mother stood there, smiling gently.

It was not her, he realized, but the image pulled from his

own  mind  shaped  in  the  creatures  flesh.  The  form  wavered,

became  his  father,  then  his  youngest  sister,  his  wife,  then  his

eldest son. At the last he saw the creatures true form, clawed

and terrible.

Then, thankfully, he saw nothing at all.

Malaugryms are incomparably talented shapeshifters, natives

of an unknown plane who use the Plane of Shadow to access

the world of Toril. They plan to eventually invade Faern but

are  hindered  by  several  weaknesses,  including  an  inability  to

master interplanar magic and an almost-pathological need to

amuse themselves with acts of cruelty. The leader of the race is

known as the Shadowmaster, and the creatures are collectively

known as the shadowmasters (although they are not associated

with either the Shadowmasters of Telflamm or the Netherese

shades, as some have suspected). Five of these creatures inhabit

Faern  at  the  present  time.  Although  they  are  meant  to  be

acting  on  behalf  of  the  entire  race  as  a  prelude  to  invasion,

they mostly pursue their own depraved and sordid agendas.

Brief History

The foul malaugryms are the corrupt and tainted offspring of

the wizard Malaug, reputedly the first human from Faern to

dare the journey to the Plane of Shadow. Given their capabili-

ties and their inability to breed with one another, the malau-

gryms  precise  ancestry  is  likely  even  more  complicated  and

bizarre than the rumors and legends hint.

Able  to  duplicate  any  creature  that  it  has  ever  seen  with

near  perfection,  each  malaugrym  nevertheless  has  one  fa-

vorite form that it reverts to when seriously threatened. Nor-

mally, however, the malaugryms blend into the population of

Faern, masquerading as humanoids and settling for periods

of  time  in  great  urban  centers  where  their  favorite  food

(humans) is plentiful.

The Organization

Headquarters:  Each  malaugrym  maintains  its  own  head-

quarters and sanctuaries, usually within the area where its cur-

rent form dwells. The Shadowmaster dwells in a stronghold on

the Plane of Shadow.

Members: 5 in Faern, about 100 altogether.

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: The Shadowmaster.

Religions: Bane, Gargauth, Shar.

Alignment: CE.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: The malaugryms do not bother with using a symbol

to represent their race. Individual malaugryms, particularly the

Arathluth of the malaugryms

spellcasters, may choose to adopt a mark of their own, but this

is sheer vanity on their part.

The  five  malaugryms  in  Faern  are  Arathluth,  Luthbyr,

Luthvaerynn, Taltuth, and Zarasluth. (Arathluth and Taluth

are detailed in Monsters of Faern.) Each initiates communi-

cation  with  one  another  and  with  the  Shadowmaster  when

they feel like it.

HIERARCHY

All malaugryms are technically equal to one another in rank

and status, except for the Shadowmaster.

Any malaugrym that possesses sufficient strength, cunning,

and power can claim the title of Shadowmaster. In order to ac-

tually wield the authority that goes with the title, however, the

would-be ruler of the race must first destroy his predecessor.

Although  malaugryms  are  almost  immortal,  they  do  age

albeit very slowlyand a Shadowmaster often lives for count-

less centuries. A new Shadowmaster is almost always younger

and stronger than the old holder of the title.

The only measurement of status among the malaugryms is

relative power. The strongest are respected even as they are

feared and hated. Bitter rivalries sometimes spring up between

individual malaugryms, who can then spend centuries at war

with one another. They dont have the patience to create in-

tricate,  long-term  plans  with  which  to  ensnare  rivals,  how-

ever,  so  their  tactics  are  generally  of  the  hit  and  run

variety. Only the Shadowmaster is able to coerce a group of

malaugryms  into  working  efficiently  with  one  another  for

any length of time.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The malaugryms intend to invade Faern in force, just as soon

as they gain the interplanar magic to make the crossing from

the Plane of Shadow en masse and the power that will enable

them to schieve victory over the other races of the continent.

At  the  rate  that  the  malaugryms  efforts  are  currently  pro-

ceeding, their master plan might not reach fruition for some

time. Exactly what the race plans to do with Faern and its in-

habitants once they are conquered is something that the race

itself has not determined completely. The current Shadowmas-

ter  has  pondered  the  feasibility  of  dragging  the  entirety  of

Toril off into the Plane of Shadow as a vast playground for

the malaugryms, but it is doubtful that any one plan remains

intact for any appreciable length of time.

Meanwhile,  the  malaugryms  currently  residing  in  Faern

spend  most  of  their  time  thrill-seeking,  questing  for  ever

greater  pleasures  of  all  description,  and  enhancing  their  pri-

vate collections of magic items. One of their chief sources of

entertainment  is  tormenting  and  harassing  other  creatures,

particularly humans, whom they find endlessly amusing.

The  fact  that  the  malaugryms  are  easily  distracted  from

their grand scheme does not mean that they can be dismissed

as serious threats, however. An adventurer who underestimates

one of these shapeshifters generally realizes his mistake only

as the creature crushes the overconfident hero like a bug.

RECRUITING

All members of the race are automatically subject to the nom-

inal authority of the Shadowmaster. No others of their kind

Mind Flayers

exist  from  which  to  draw  fresh  recruits.  But  because  malau-

gryms  cannot  breed  with  one  another,  perhaps  due  to  some

defect in their physiology, those active in Faern must mate

with humans and then steal the resulting offspring. Their part-

ners generally dont know whats happening until it is too late,

and most do not survive the process of bringing a new malau-

grym into the world.

ALLIES

The malaugryms have no permanent allies, either as a group

or individually. All their partnerships exist to be exploited and

then dissolved and the partners destroyed at the malaugryms

convenience. They dont discriminate when choosing their un-

witting  tools.  A  malaugrym  is  as  likely  to  form  an  alliance

with  the  forces  of  good  as  it  is  with  those  of  evil,  provided

that  doing  so  somehow  satisfies  the  creatures  unwholesome

agenda and desire for amusement. A scant handful of mortals

are allied to the malaugryms knowing full well what they are

aiding, but such folk tend to possess a high degree of personal

power and take steps to protect themselves from betrayal.

ENEMIES

Since  they  intend  to  invade  and  conquer  Faern  eventually,

malaugryms tend to view all other races, groups, and creatures

as  their  foes.  They  do  not  necessarily  hate  these  opponents,

however. They simply see them as inconsequential and irrele-

vant, mere tools that exist for the malaugryms pleasure.

Only toward the Harpers and the Chosen of Mystra do the

malaugrym  feel  something  more  than  contempt.  These

groups have thwarted the malaugryms ambitions in the past,

activities for which the creatures will never forgive them. A

malaugrym  may  spend  months  planning  the  capture  of  a

Harper,  and  actually  obtaining  an  agent  of  this  interfering

group  is  an  opportunity  for  the  malaugrym  to  unleash  its

darkest creative whims.

Encounters

Because each malaugrym is unique, the creatures are only en-

countered  separately.  Individuals  can  employ  or  gather  any

number of servitor creatures if they so choose. These servants

function  as  guards,  playthings,  or  any  other  role  the  malau-

grym wishes. The lives of these slaves are invariably unpleas-

ant and exceedingly short.

All  malaugryms  favor  a  stealthy,  clandestine  approach  to

conflict. They prefer to send minions, slaves, and allies against

a  foe  rather  than  take  the  field  themselves.  When  they  are

obliged  to  enter  combat  personally,  they  employ  tactics  de-

signed  to  conceal  their  true  nature.  These  creatures  rarely

expose  their  true  nature,  especially  in  a  battle;  most  would

prefer to leave the field rather than risk exposure to a possibly

superior foe.

The  spells  and  magic  items  they  employ  tend  to  support

these  tactics.  They  favor  illusions  and  similar  misleading  ef-

fects,  and  habitually  create  lairs  that  feature  a  multitude  of

false  elements  (illusory  walls,  secret  staircases,  hidden  com-

partments,  traps  concealed  by  illusion  and  clever  stonework,

and the like).

Mind Flayers

The taste link is active, Sugglir sent to his assembled peers.

Begin, came the collective response.

Human  food-creature,  sent  Sugglir  to  the  bound  captive,

you are honored by being chosen as the subject of panur. My

mind and yours are linked. When I feast upon your brain, you

shall sense it, and savor its taste as much as I do. In this way,

perhaps  your  soul  will  be  convinced  to  tread  the  world  in  the

future as an illithid, rather than as surface cattle. With that,

Sugglirs tentacles bored their way into Kilimurs skull.

Kilimur screamed, but as he died he learned that the mind

flayer found his brain to be quite delicious.

The mind flayers are rightly feared for their evil, their power,

and their diet of the brains of intelligent creatures. They as-

semble  in  great  cities  in  the  Underdark  and  enslave  entire

colonies of sentients to work for them and serve as sources of

food. What prevents them from immediately conquering the

world, in addition to their very specific dietary needs, is their

inherently self-serving natureeven a slight setback causes an

illithid to flee in the interest of preserving its own skin.

Brief History

As with the beholders, the origin of the illithids is the source

of  much  speculation  and  little  fact.  Some  think  they  came

from another plane, some from another time or from across

the Sea of Night. Others theorize that they come from a place

outside  the  normal  considerations  of  Faerns  cosmology.

There are other worlds where mind flayers rule and all other

races  are  their  livestock,  and  it  was  ancient  slave  rebellions

against  the  mind  flayers  that  resulted  in  psionically  active

races  such  as  the  duergar.  As  things  stand,  mind  flayers  are

scattered across the world, and no one can point to a specific

place where they originated.

the Organization

These statistics apply to the population of illithids living in or

under Faern.

Headquarters: Various cities in the Underdark.

Members: Unknown,  but  at  least  five  cities  of  1,000  or

more mind flayers are known to exist in the Underdark.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: None, or the elder-brain of a city.

Religion: Ilsensine.

Alignment: LE.

Secrecy: None (although few on the surface other than il-

lithids know the locations of the Underdark cities).

Symbol: Mind  flayers  have  no  common  symbol,  although

their cities sometimes have a unique icon that decorates items

created there.

ILSENSINE

While  all  mind  flayers  revere  Ilsensine,  their  evil  deity  of

knowledge,  conquest,  and  mental  power,  few  choose  to

devote themselves to the deity and become clerics. Each il-

lithid  city  has  a  handful  of  clerics  that  remain  somewhat

apart  from  the  others  in  the  city.  Ilsensine  is  said  to  look

like  an  enormous  green  brain  trailing  countless  tentacles

that  lead  throughout  its  cavernous  realm  and  into  the

hidden corners of all planes. Its symbol is a brain with two

tentacles.  The  domains  associated  with  it  are  Charm,  Evil,

Knowledge,  Law,  Mentalism,  and  Tyranny.  Its  favored

weapon is the tentacle (whip).

CITIES OF THE ILLITHIDS

A  mind  flayer  city  is  a  hideously  beautiful  place,  alien  in

construction  and  designed  to  suit  creatures  that  can  natu-

rally levitate. Openings to palatial tunnels rise in staggered

levels up the sides of great caverns, ramps are used instead

of stairs, and the lowest level is relegated to slaves and slave

handlers.  At  the  center  of  the  city  is  a  large  building  that

houses  the  elder-brain,  the  aggregate  intelligence  and

memory  of  mind  flayers  that  have  died.  Within  the  elder-

brains  pool  swim  the  tadpolelike  young  of  the  race,  which

implant  themselves  in  a  humanoid  host  when  they  reach

maturity,  eventually  transforming  the  host  body  into  the

form of an adult mind flayer.

Mind  flayers  work  to  advance  the  plans  of  their  commu-

nity  and  divide  themselves  into  smaller  groups  for  specific

purposes,  such  as  creating  attack  strategies,  planning  slaving

runs, searching for a way to dim the light of the sun, or creat-

ing magic items to enhance their psionic abilities. Illithids en-

countered  outside  a  city  are  either  agents  of  these  smaller

groups  or  (rarely)  traitorous  citizens  marked  for  death.

Whether associated with a city or not, mind flayers vigorously

compete  with  each  other,  rarely  pooling  their  powers,  even

when working toward the same goal.

HIERARCHY

The head of a mind flayer city is the elder-brain, which tele-

pathically links all the illithid minds within a mile of the city

itself. The elder-brain is parent, orator, judge, arbiter, gover-

nor,  and  library  for  the  illithids.  Imbued  with  vast  psionic

power from its constituent preserved brains, the elder-brain

cannot  move  and  has  no  ability  to  physically  defend  itself,

but its mental powers can effortlessly bring any mind flayer

to its knees.

Below  the  elder-brain  is  the  Elder  Concord,  a  council  of

mind flayers representing each of the various illithid creeds

(factions). The Elder Concord sets goals for the community,

elects officials for various duties, and takes care of most of

the responsibilities for ruling a community. Underneath the

Elder Concord are the common illithids of the city, which

either  work  alone  or  agglomerate  into  inquisitions  or  cults.

Below the common illithids are the many slaves of the city,

which do all the actual labor, act as the citys military arm,

and eventually end up as meals for the mind flayers. A city

usually has one or two races of thralls to maintain its breed-

ing population.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The mind flayers wish to dominate the world so that they may

live lives of luxury, feasting upon the refined minds of care-

fully bred thralls and honing their psionic powers to a fantas-

tic  degree.  How  each  illithid  plans  to  see  this  goal  achieved

may  differsome  wish  to  blot  the  cursed  sun  that  prevents

them  from  easily  waging  war  on  the  surface,  some  wish  to

amass great armies of slaves, some to create psionic items of

incredible power, and some have even stranger and more in-

comprehensible  goals.  Any  motivation  is  a  means  to  the  de-

sired end of world domination.

RECRUITING

Mind flayers do not recruit. To them, other races are only po-

tential  slaves.  Only  when  it  is  to  their  advantage  or  when

greatly  outnumbered  do  they  ally  with  others  instead  of  en-

slaving them, and any creatures recruited by the illithids are

eventually going to be charmed and enslaved by them. Almost

any  type  of  creature  with  a  discernible  intelligence  may  be

found as an illithid thrall.

ALLIES

Mind  flayers  have  few  true  allies,  although  they  sometimes

make  temporary  alliances  with  other  Underdark  races.  They

keep  slaves  of  almost  any  race;  the  most  common  ones  are

grimlocks, because grimlocks breed fast and are willing to eat

the remains a hungry mind flayer leaves behind. The illithids

also frequently have chuul as slaves, and use many Underdark-

adapted animals as spies (the illithids scour the animals brains

to get the information they wants, bypassing the limited intel-

ligence of the creatures).

Mind flayers sometimes lead small bands of doppelgangers,

a type of group known as a druuth. The shapechangers are able

to  infiltrate  various  organizations  and  societies,  providing

their illithid masters with valuable information.

ENEMIES

The illithids have many enemiesnamely, every creature that

isnt an illithid, because no sane mind would volunteer to be en-

slaved and eaten by these monsters. However, some beings in

particular are frequent foes. Deep dragons and drow compete

with the mind flayers for living space and slaves. Undead of all

kinds  are  hated  and  feared,  for  they  are  immune  to  most

psionic powers, forcing the mind flayers to use their own natu-

ral attacks or waste valuable slaves.

The duergar are the most ardent foes of the mind flayers.

Once a normal clan of dwarves, after being enslaved and tam-

pered with for generations, the duergar shook themselves free

of their mental chains and emerged into the Underdark as a

new  subrace  of  dwarves.  The  duergar  have  never  forgotten

their enslavement, and they train all their soldiers in illithid-

fighting tactics.

Encounters

Mind flayers avoid direct combat, preferring to let their slaves

deal with this dirty business. If they have to fight, they hide

behind  a  wall  of  slaves  and  use  their  mind  blast and  psionic

abilities to neutralize foes. If they are particularly confident,

they may enter melee personally to extract the brain of some-

one they find appealing. A rare few mind flayers have devel-

oped new psionic powers that enhance their physical prowess

and enable them to gain levels in the monk class.

If combat turns against it, even slightly, an illithid is likely

to flee, abandoning its slaves. It may later sneak back to the

site and charm any survivors, whether thrall or enemy.

Monks of the

Dark Moon

Tharag waited. He told himself for the eighth time that his legs

did not ache, that his knees did not hurt. Focus, he said to him-

self.  Let  them  see  only  what  you  wish  them  to  see:  a  humble

beggar  kneeling  in  the  entrance  to  a  stinking  Market  Street

alley,  hoping  for  a  copper  coin  or  a  crust  of  stale  bread.  He

hunched deeper into his cloak of shapeless homespun, smeared

with cow dung and straw to give it the look and odor that iden-

tified him as one of Westgates innumerable mendicants, and

rattled  his  wooden  alms  bowl  convincingly.  Tharag  prayed

silently to the Lady of Loss for patience and was rewarded mo-

ments later when a silver coin clanked into is bowl. He caught

the scent of costly Sembian perfume and heard the voice hed

been waiting to hear for all afternoon.

For  your  warmth  and  comfort,  she  said.  Tharag  did  not

look  up,  because  an  ordinary  beggar  would  not.  He  merely

bobbed his head and muttered his thanks for the charity. She

was  gone  a  moment  later  in  a  swish  of  silk,  the  delicate  fra-

grance of her perfume lingering slightly.

Reaching into the bowl, Tharag scooped the coin deftly into

his robes, fingering as he did so the characters cut deeply into

one side. The Thorsar Docks, read the letters. His actions, had

they been observed by anyone in the street, would have seemed

completely normal, and he took pains to give no indication that

the coin had been anything other than a particularly generous

gift  from  a  good-hearted  lady.  But  inwardly  he  smiled.  He

knew, now, where to find the man he had come here to kill. He

did not know why the church of Shar wished this ship captain

dead, and he did not care. The Dark Abbot had marked the

man for death, and that is all that Tharag, monk of the Dark

Moon, needed to know.

The  monks  of  the  Dark  Moon  are  an  elite  sect  of  Sharran

agents. They serve the Mistress of the Night by carrying out

tasks  that  she  prefers  not  to  assign  to  her  ordinary  clergy.

From their temples located in lands where evil rules the day as

well as the night, monks of the Dark Moon strike at Shars en-

emies  with  lightning  swiftness  and  terrifying  lethality.

Whether her whim is espionage, sabotage, or murder, the Lady

of Loss can be certain that her monastic order undertakes to

fulfill  it  with  extraordinary  zeal.  The  monks  of  the  Dark

Moon have proven to be Shars ace in the hole on a number of

occasions,  most  particularly  when  fighting  against  her  hated

sister, Selne, and her rival, the deity Loviatar.

In addition to its fortified temples, the sect also maintains

shrines dedicated to its patron deity in Underdark caverns, and

it  has  established  safe  houses  and  boltholes  in  the  unsavory

quarters  of  larger  cities  where  Sharrans  are  not  welcome.

While the monks of the Dark Moon sometimes work jointly

Monks of the Dark Moon

with agents and members of the church of Shar, they are not

considered  part  of  her  normal  clergy  but  rather  an  autono-

mous  organization.  This  status  enables  the  monks  to  remain

free to train in their particular skills, to focus on their devo-

tion  to  their  deity,  and  to  ready  themselves  for  the  instant

Shar calls them to action.

Brief History

Over the course of the last decade, Loviatar has been making

inroads  into  part  of  Shars  traditional  territory  (principally,

the domain of Suffering). Due to her ordinary clergys appar-

ent lack of success in halting the incursion, Shar decided that

she required a different kind of fighting force for certain types

of  mission.  She  conceived  a  disciplined  and  loyal  monastic

order  that  would  serve  as  her  elite  force  when  her  earthly

needs included subtlety, infiltration, or assassination.

To  create  her  monastic  order,  Shar  turned  to  her  most

trusted  and  devious  mortal  servant,  Alorgoth.  Heeding  his

deity, the Bringer of Doom journeyed far beyond his normal

wanderings  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  continent  to  the

Lands of Intrigue. He went first to the city of Purskul, where

he commissioned the construction of the imposing, grim edi-

fice  that  was  to  be  the  orders  first  monastery  (much  to  the

alarm of other religious factions in the city). While the stone-

masons and carpenters labored, Alorgoth visited the cities of

Athkatla,  Crimmor,  and  Keczulla  to  begin  recruiting  the

orders first members from among Sharran cells in those cities.

He sought among these cults for folk who met three princi-

pal  criteria.  First,  they  must  be  young  adults.  Second,  they

must  not  have  yet  been  ordained  into  Shars  clergy.  Finally,

they must have demonstrated some manifestation of sorcerous

power or potential. Within a year, he had invoked his particu-

lar  brand  of  subterfuge  and  manipulation  to  gather  several

dozen ambitious young men and women who apparently met

his  requirements,  and  who  were  eager  to  gain  the  secrets  of

personal  power  that  their  new  mentor  had  promised  them.

Making their way to Purskul, they entered the monastery and

began their training. None of them have been seen since . . . at

least, not in any guise recognizable to those who knew them.

The  Bringer  of  Doom  made  good  on  his  promises  to  his

young  disciples,  after  a  fashion.  The  young  adults  who  fol-

lowed him to Purskul learned many secrets, but they also paid

a  high  price  for  their  knowledge.  Becoming  a  monk  of  the

Dark Moon requires the utmost dedication to purpose. Some

of the initiates were unable to withstand the grueling physical

punishment  and  mental  rigor  demanded  of  them.  Some  did

not actually possess the sorcerous abilities they had claimed,

and a few simply could not reconcile the vile acts they were

expected to perform as part of their training with their moral

conscience, despite what they had believed was a strong faith

in  Shar.  Alorgoth  eliminated  these  failures  as  a  matter  of

course. He could not afford to permit the washouts to return

home  to  their  friends  and  family  with  news  of  what  was

taking  place  inside  the  forbidding  structure.  Most  of  these

were  killed  by  their  fellow  disciples  in  the  first  year  of  the

monasterys operation, either as human sacrifices during reli-

gious ceremonies dedicated to Shar, or as victims in live train-

ing  exercises.  A  few  Alorgoth  destroyed  himself,  purely  for

the pleasure it gave him.

Shortly after the weak and useless were weeded out, Alor-

goth  turned  the  operation  of  the  monastery  over  to  three

senior priests of Shar, newly arrived from the Temple of Old

Night. The deity had directed these clerics to make themselves

available at the monastery to finish the indoctrination of the

monks started by Alorgoth, for whom she now had other tasks.

Several monks who had long worshiped the Lady of Loss like-

wise joined the priests to continue the martial training of the

initiates. The last members of the instructional team to arrive

were a pair of sorcerers and an assassin, who would ensure that

the monks developed their arcane talents and the killing skills

they  would  require.  The  initial  period  of  training  concluded

two years ago with a class project: the infiltration and mass

poisoning of the entire retinue of Purskuls clerics of Chaun-

tea, whose temple has stood empty ever since.

By the time the period of instruction was completed, some

five years after the monastery was built, Shar possessed a squad

of well-trained martial and sorcerous experts, ready to attack,

defend, live, and die at her command.

The Organization

Headquarters: None.

Members: 192.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: Shar.

Religion: Shar.

Alignment: LE.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: Shars  symbol,  a  black  disc  with  a  deep  purple

border.

Like the church of Shar, the monks of the Dark Moon follow

and obey a strict hierarchy. Failure to follow the orders of a su-

perior  is  grounds  for  execution.  Shar  does  not  reveal  all  she

knows to her monks any more than she does to her clerics, but

this  fact  does  not  trouble  the  members  of  the  Dark  Moon

order. They have faith that the Dark Deity will reveal exactly

what they need to know to serve her well.

Most of the monks of the Dark Moon are human, but their

numbers  also  include  a  few  half-orcs,  drow,  tieflings,  and  a

shade or two.

HIERARCHY

The  rank-and-file  monks  refer  to  one  another  as  Dark

Brother or Dark Sister. Those who aspire to become monks

of  the  Dark  Moon  must  endure  a  year-long  novitiate  period

during which they endure rigorous mental and physical train-

ing, as well as preliminary religious indoctrination under the

watchful tutelage of the Dark Fathers and Dark Mothers of

the monastery. If the novitiates perform well during this time,

they earn the chance to become full-fledged members of the

order. At that point, they are given their first missions, gener-

ally tasks of infiltration, espionage, or sabotage. If the initiates

fulfill  their  individual  tasks  with  distinction,  they  are  made

full members of the order. At that point, the intensity of all

aspects of training only increases, and the missions they under-

take become more demanding and dangerous.

Senior  monks  are  known  as  Dark  Father  or  Dark

Mother. They are generally the most skilled monk/sorcerers

Curses  (Su): Trails  of  emerald  energy  occasionally  travel

across Larlochs body. These manifestations are a side effect

of  the  defensive  curses  he  protects  himself  with.  If  he

touches a creature or is struck by a touch attack or unarmed

strike, the target creature or attacking creature is affected by

a bestow curse spell (saving throw and spell resistance apply).

In  addition  to  the  possible  effects  listed  in  the  Players

Handbook, Larlochs curses can also cause the target creature

to assume a withered and horrific appearance, or make them

appear rotting and covered in sores. Some of Larlochs curses

take effect days or weeks after this contact. A creature trying

to remove one of these curses must make a caster level check

to succeed, even with spells such as remove curse.

Fear  Aura  (Su): This  ability  operates  continuously.  Crea-

tures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the

lich must succeed at a Will save or be affected as though by a

fear spell as cast by a 32nd-level sorcerer.

Immunities  (Ex): Larloch  is  immune  to  cold,  electricity,

polymorph,  and  mind-affecting  attacks.  Larloch  is  also

immune to one arcane spell per spell level, but which spells

those are is unknown.

Silver Vulnerability (Ex): Larloch suffers double damage

from silver weapons. This unique vulnerability is a side effect

of some of the permanent magical alterations he has made to

his body.

Spell-Like  Abilities: Through  the  use  of  wish spells  and

lengthy rituals (each of which costs him a spell

slot  of  levels  1st9th),  Larloch  can  use

each  of  the  following  spells  once  per

day as a spell-like ability: magic mis-

sile,  web,  dispel  magic,  arcane  eye,

animate  dead,  chain  lightning,  con-

trol undead, devastate undead (see

the appendix), and energy drain.

Epic-Level Abilities: Bonus spell

level  12  (included  in  the  listing

below).

Wizard Spells Per Day (4/7/7/

7/6/6/6/6/5/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/

1/1/1;  base  DC  =  22  +  spell

level): Larloch typically carries

a  variety  of  attack,  defensive,

and  utility  spells,  including  a

quickened  teleport,  a  quickened

time  stop, and  a  quickened  wail

of  the  banshee.  All  his  spells  are

prepared with the Eschew Mate-

rials feats if necessary and possi-

ble, and many are prepared with

the  Delay  Spell  and  Still  Spell

feats.

Spellbook: As  a  wizard

dating  back  to  the  time  of

Netheril,  Larloch  has  access  to

spellbooks  containing  all  arcane  spells  from  the  Players

Handbook, the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, this

book, and any other source you deem appropriate.

Possessions: Amulet of the planes, belt of proof against de-

Monks of the Dark Moon

in  each  monastery,  responsible  for  training  the  initiates  and

the rank-and-file monks.

The  most  senior  monk  in  a  given  monastery  is  Dark

Father Abbot or Dark Mother Abbess. They are the leaders

of the monasteries, and the hearts and souls of the order. They

receive their orders directly from Shar and do not undertake

missions  personally  unless  she  commands  it.  They  convene

once each year at the Temple of Old Night to meet with the

ranking clerics of the deity.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The monks of the Dark Moon exist to serve Shar. More fa-

natical  than  the  members  of  her  priesthood,  they  strive  to

emulate the important tenets of Shars dogma in all things.

Hopeless  and  remorseless,  they  find  spiritual  fulfillment  in

acting as a weapon in the hand of the Mistress of the Night.

Their only interest lies in striving for perfection according to

their religious beliefs.

In practical terms, the monks of the Dark Moon share the

same goal as the church of Shar. Their methods, however, are

less obvious and more selective. Whereas the priesthood might

be engaged in a long-term plan to topple a city government,

the monks might be charged with slipping into that citys chief

government  building  and  kidnapping  or  killing  a  designated

target. A Sharran cell could sponsor a thieves guild to under-

mine a citys social order and turn worshipers away from good-

aligned  deities  toward  Shar,  even  as  a  squad  of  Dark  Moon

monks waylay a cleric of Selne in that same city, murder him,

and leave his body for the morning crows.

lavender ellipsoid (absorb spells up to 4th level), pale white

portation), 2 vibrant purple prisms (stores 6 levels of spells).

Wealth: Larloch has an additional 3,000,000 gp or more

worth of magic items and treasure in his lair, and knows all

the properties of these items. If he is attacked or expecting to

be attacked, he can arm himself with almost any non-artifact

item ever created, and has several other artifacts at his dis-

posal,  most  of  which  are  unknown  or  presumed  lost  or  de-

stroyed by ignorant parties.

Larloch is said to be the last surviving Netherese arcanist-

king, who ruled over his flying city for years and abandoned

it before Karsuss folly. Now a lich and one of the oldest non-

draconic beings in Faern, Larloch has amassed an arsenal of

spells, magic items, and servants. The Shadow King, as he is

known  in  the  Sword  Coast,  now  rules  the  Warlocks  Crypt

(which is actually a corruption of Larlochs name) and its in-

habitantsliches  (many  from  Netheril),  vampires,  wights,

and lesser undead.

Larlochs form has succumbed to the ravages of time. His

flesh is completely gone, leaving only white bone draped in

fine garments. His empty eye sockets glow with pinpoints of

red light, and over two dozen ioun stones drift around his head.

His mind has been affected by his extreme age as well, for at

times he is crazed, hurling spells at random, and others he is

completely calm. Most times he slays intruders outright. At

least sixteen powerful Red Wizards have tried to kill him and

take his power, but they all failed. He has been known to con-

verse with adventurers before slaying them, and has a reputa-

tion for freeing some in exchange for a service. These services

usually involve bringing him some powerful and well-guarded

magic item, and he shrouds his captives in contingent curses

and geases should they think to abandon their task.

The Warlocks Crypt, located in the western Troll Hills on

the Sword Coast, is a series of wizard towers linked into the

form of a large walled castle. Within the central courtyard

are other buildings, which house the undead forms of Lar-

lochs armies. Bridges connect the towers and their individual

courtyards,  with  bonebats  and  other  strange  creatures  flit-

ting about in search of live creatures, which are brought to

Larloch for experimentation. Those foolish enough to enter

the Crypt should avoid the tallest tower, for that is the home

of  Larloch  himself.  The  others  house  the  vampires  and

liches, each controlling a few levels and conducting their own

vile research.

If pressed in combat or bored with a situation, he prefers

to disappear, either with teleport, etherealness, or by a custom

spell  that  lets  him  walk  through  walls.  Hidden  within  his

tower are chambers that rapidly heal undead bodies, and he

spends much of his time in such places. If forced to fight (or

in the mood to do so), he enjoys using a rapid arsenal of haste,

time  stop, and  quickened  spells  to  overwhelm  opponents

before  they  even  have  a  chance  to  react.  Against  powerful

spellcasters he often uses the haste partial action granted by

one  of  his  ioun  stones to  ready  a  counterspell  every  round,

either using dispel magic or his Improved Counterspell feat

to  negate  his  opponents  attack  spells.  With  his  armory  of

items he carries with him, it is extremely doubtful that he

could ever be caught unawares, and even if he were suddenly

overwhelmed  by  attacks,  he  is  protected  by  a  contingency

spell that teleports him to one of his safe rooms if he ever

loses  half  or  more  of  his  hit  points.  As  a  being  nearly  two

thousand years old, Larloch has thought of ways to deal with

almost  any  situation,  and  with  his  supergenius  intellect  he

can compose near-perfect plans at will about situations for

which he had not prepared.

Monks of the Dark Moon

RECRUITING

The  monasteries  are  highly  selective,  preferring  quality  to

quantity. Aspirants to the order must meet the criteria estab-

lished by the Bringer of Doom for the original initiates. The

monks  of  the  Dark  Moon  fear  infiltration  even  more  than

does the church of Selne, but the sheer difficulty of the Dark

Moon training regimen, coupled with the standard practices of

Sharran worship, almost always winnows out any unqualified

applicants.

ALLIES

Shars allies are the monks allies. The decrees of the deity mo-

tivate and drive the monks of the Dark Moon. They do not

seek alliances or make enemies except as directed by the Lady

of Loss, and then only so that her evil may flourish. Even so,

the  Dark  Abbots  and  Abbesses  do  not  countenance  the  pur-

poseful  alienation  of  the  common  folk  who  dwell  near  their

monasteries. The work of the Dark Moon is best accomplished

under the cloak of secrecy, and blatant maltreatment of com-

moners merely attracts self-righteous do-gooders who must in-

evitably be eliminated lest they endanger the security of the

order. Some Dark Moon strongholds strive to convince nearby

communities that their members are merely a group of peace-

ful  ascetics.  Cultivating  friendly  relations  with  the  native

people  often  provides  a  level  of  camouflage  that  cannot  be

achieved even through magical means.

ENEMIES

Shars enemies are the monks enemies. The Dark Brothers and

Sisters strike when and where they are commanded, and do not

dwell on ethics or morals exterior to Shars dogma. The Dark

Brothers and Sisters harbor special hatred for those who serve

Shars sister. The monks discipline permits them to resist the

temptation to indulge in personal vendettas or any other types

of activity not prescribed by their missions.

Encounters

Monks of the Dark Moon do not suspend their training within

their monasteries without orders, so all encounters with them

will be related to a mission or assignment they are undertaking

on the orders of their superiors. A typical individual encounter

is  a  monk/sorcerer  of  at  least  2nd/1st  level.  All  Dark  Moon

sorcerers  use  the  Shadow  Weave.  A  typical  small  group  en-

counter is a monk/sorcerer leader of at least 3rd/2nd level, and

several accompanying monks or monk/sorcerers.

Monks of the Dark Moon who multiclass as sorcerers are

taught lesser shadow tentacle and greater shadow tentacle (see

the  appendix)  when  they  reach  the  appropriate  caster  level.

These spells are primarily defensive, though they can also be

used to restrain a target immediately prior to assassination.

The greatest strength of the order is its unity of purpose.

The  monks  single-minded  devotion  to  Shars  will  instills

within  them  a  fanaticism  unrivaled  even  by  Shars  most  de-

voted clerics. The monks draw their strength from the mean-

ing that Shar gives to their lives, and this in turn renders them

capable of the amazing feats of body and mind they employ in

pursuit of their assignments. Betrayal of the order or of Shar is

unthinkable  to  the  men  and  women  who  have  taken  the

orders dark vows. If captured, they resolutely endure torture

or  punishment,  secure  in  the  knowledge  that  they  will  con-

tinue to serve Shar even after death, knowing that she finds a

use for their bodies and souls even after they pass beyond the

living plane.

If  the  monks  have  a  weakness,  it  is  their  dependence  on

their deity for all information and direction. Consequently, if

the  circumstances  of  a  mission  change  abruptly,  or  if  the

monks  are  confronted  with  an  unanticipated  problem,  they

may be slow in adapting to the new situation or threat. Also,

their cloistered lifestyle sometimes works against them. They

know little of the world outside their monastery walls, and are

sometimes  imperfect  in  their  disguises  due  to  a  lack  of  local

knowledge. A hero who has reason to suspect that an agent of

this order is in the vicinity might be on the lookout for some-

one who looks native but acts without a natives habits. Natu-

rally,  the  monks  are  at  a  distinct  disadvantage  against

opponents  who  wield  holy  weapons  or  magic,  and  their  pre-

dominantly  lawful  outlook  makes  them  vulnerable  to  the

powers of chaos as well.

The Dark Abbots and Abbesses prepare the Dark Brothers

and  Sisters  for  each  mission  personally,  dictating  how  the

agents  are  to  function  in  combat.  The  leaders  of  the  order

make a sincere attempt to warn the monks about the typical

habits, tactics, and strategies that their enemies exhibit, so that

the monks can be as prepared as possible for the missions dan-

gers.  Many  monks  of  the  Dark  Moon  have  personal  special-

tiesambush, arson, poisoning, fighting mounted foes, and so

onand they are chosen for missions in which these skills will

be  useful.  The  monks  of  the  Dark  Moon  prefer  to  fight  in

well-rehearsed  patterns,  each  relying  on  the  others  in  the

group to do what they have practiced countless times. When

engaged  on  a  mission,  the  monks  are  focused  completely  on

their objective: all other considerations are secondary, includ-

ing the well-being of any allies or associates with whom they

may be working. As long as a monk is left alive, he will con-

tinue to attempt to carry out his orders, and he is prepared to

sacrifice himself in the attempt.

Dark Moon Shrine

Unlike a typical monks temple or shrine that normally con-

sists of wooden or stone buildings constructed to form a com-

pound and isolated from the outside world by a wall, the place

where monks of the Dark Moon conduct their religious rites is

heavily  protected  from  prying  eyes.  This  particular  shrine  is

located  underground,  beneath  the  northwestern  foothills  of

the Sword Mountains (in the Sword Coast North), within 20

miles of the Mere of Dead Men. Monks of the order who op-

erate in Waterdeep and Luskan meet here periodically to cele-

brate  certain  Sharran  rites  and  to  begin  the  training  of

prospective recruits.

The  shrine  is  reached  via  a  cave  mouth  located  in  a  deep

valley that lies in the shadow of the foothills above.

1. Tunnel Entrance

The  floor  of  the  outer  caverns  slopes  downward  sharply,

ending in a winding stairway of black marble steps that were

placed  here  by  the  monks.  The  staircase  descends  150  feet

below the level of the outer caverns, ending at a worked stone

tunnel that leads into the shrine. The section of the entrance

shown on the map is 70 feet from the foot of the stairway.

2. Guard Room

When  the  monks  gather  to  venerate  their  deity,  they  assign

several rank-and-file members of the order to keep watch in

this  chamber  so  that  intruders  or  enemies  cannot  defile  the

proceedings.

Creatures: 3  monks  of  the  Dark  Moon  (LE  human

Mnk2/Sor1).

Tactics: Intruders  are  met  with  immediate  martial  resist-

ance. Two of the three monks attack intruders (the unwanted

guests get no warnings or chance to retreat), while the third

races for reinforcements.

3. Trap

When the complex is occupied, one of the orders arcane spell-

casters places an alarm spell in this area each morning, usually

in  the  center  of  the  tunnel.  Subsequent  castings  of  the  same

spell ensure that this spot is always sensitive to the presence of

intruders  while  the  monks  remain.  The  presiding  monk

chooses  a  new  password  each  day,  and  the  monks  passing  by

A victorious monk of the Dark Moon

Monks of the Dark Moon

this spot speak it to avoid setting off the trap. Creatures who

fail  to  give  the  password  trigger  the  spell  effect  (an  audible

alarm).

4. Chamber of Lost Hope

This large room smells strongly of the distinctive odor of old

blood. More than simply a display area for the grotesque fres-

coes that decorate one of its walls, it also serves as an object

lesson in the values taught by the Sharrans. The overall effect

of this chamber is to fill the visitor with the feeling of hope-

lessness inherent to the proper veneration of Shar. The monks

of the Dark Moon meet in this chamber to contemplate these

works and meditate upon the meaning of hopelessness and its

role in their religion. This is the first exposure that initiates

have to the world of the Sharran monks.

5. Fresco of Hopelessness

The frescoes depict scenes that remind the viewer that life is

merely  a  pointless  exercise  en  route  to  the  final  journey  of

death. A permanent symbol of hopelessness is worked into the

paintings in each fresco (except for the fresco of pain, below),

triggered whenever a creature looks at it without uttering the

password  (dolor).  Only  full-fledged  monks  know  the  pass-

word, so initiates encounter the full impact of Shars teachings

when they first visit this place.

the  wall  in  the  center  of  the  frescoes.  Doing  so  deals  1d4+1

points of damage. The blade has the properties of a weapon of

wounding. The monks who slice their palms on its surface then

proceed to the fresco on the far right.

7. Fresco of Pain

The  fresco  that  once  decorated  this  section  of  wall  has  been

completely lost beneath the layers of dried, smeared blood that

cover  its  surface.  After  ritually  cutting  their  palms  on  the

blade  of  suffering,  the  monks  slowly  imprint  their  bleeding

palms  on  the  rough  surface  of  this  blood-encrusted  fresco,

mingling their fresh blood with the old and causing themselves

serious pain.

8. Hall of Catechism

In  this  20-foot-wide  hallway,  the  monks  gather  (after  per-

forming their ritual in the Chamber of Lost Hope) to recite

the catechism of Shar and perform the acts of ritual sacrifice

she demands.

9. Arch of Forgetfulness

The curved section of wall at the end of the hall of catechism

is painted with a large representation of Shars symbol, 10 feet

in diameter. Above the symbol is a permanent symbol of insan-

ity, again protected by a password (mentem).

6. Blade of Suffering

After a sufficient period of genuflection, the monks file forward

and pass their right palms over a thin vertical blade attached to

10. Pit Trap

These traps are designed to capture intruders who may have

made it this far into the shrine. Each is 40 feet deep.

13. Secret Stair

A Search check (DC 20) enables a character to locate the secret

door built into the corridor wall. Beyond the doorway is a set of

stone  steps  that  lead  downward  to  the  lower  levels  of  the

shrine. Below lie sleeping quarters for the monks, holding cells

for  sacrificial  victims,  and  storage  areas  for  preserved  foods

and other mundane items.

14. Well of Secrets

The monks of the Dark Moon selected this place as a shrine to

their deity primarily because of this place. The walls and floor

of this natural cavern are slick with mineral-rich water that

seeps along their surfaces to collect and pool in the center of

the cave floor, where it continues to flow deeper into the earth

through  minute  cracks.  The  result  is  a  constantly  full,  dark

pool. The monks consider this cavern the most sacred part of

the shrine, and here that they pray and meditate. Members of

Shars  priesthood  who  visit  the  shrine  find  that  divination

spells,  such  as  augury and  commune, seem  to  work  unusually

well when cast next to the dark water (doubled effect, either in

duration or in the number of questions that can be asked).

15. Secret Council Chamber

The secret door (Search DC 20) located on the wall of Hall of

Catechism  leads  to  this  octagonal  chamber.  Located  within

rests a long table and a set of eight matching chairs, all fash-

ioned from blackwood and polished to a mirror sheen. Etched

into the surface of the table is a relief map of the Sword Coast

North,  depicting  the  territory  from  Waterdeep  to  Icewind

Dale and from the western coast to the Evermoors.

Monks of the

Long Death

The cleric of Eilistraee smiled as he approached the cowled beg-

gars  on  the  road.  Good  morning,  fellow  travelers.  Are  you

well? Do you need food? My friends and I are happy to provide

for those in need.

The  beggars  stopped  walking,  and  the  first  one  spoke.  We

need to kill you.

What? asked the cleric, frowning.

We  need  to  kill  you,  but  not  before  we  show  you  a  lot  of

pain. The beggar pulled off his robe, revealing a lithe, muscu-

lar body adorned with a large skull tattoo on his chest. The other

beggars followed suit, then charged the cleric.

The monks of the Long Death are members of an old order de-

voted to the concept of death, and they are masters of using

natural means to inflict death upon others. They care little for

what deity holds the portfolio of death, serving Cyric briefly

before Kelemvor, Myrkul before Cyric, and Jergal long before

Myrkul.

Brief History

This order of the Long Death dates back to the early days of

Calimshan after it was freed from the rule of the genies. It was

founded as a means for the slaves of the genies to develop the

ability  to  defend  themselves  and  strike  out  against  their  ele-

mental  masters,  but  as  time  went  on  the  monks  became  ob-

sessed  with  killing  and  death  beyond  their  original  purpose.

Since  being  driven  out  of  Calimshan,  they  have  been  chased

away several times from places they try to settle in, but always

find a place where they can take root again. The monastery in

the Lake of Steam is nestled in the Firesteap Mountains south-

east of Innarlith and is over one hundred years old. Founded

by  a  devout  worshiper  of  Myrkul,  the  monastery  still  bears

many symbols of that dead deity.

The Organization

The monastery could be considered a place of peace if not for

all the combat practice. When not sparring, the monks of the

Long  Death  are  quiet  and  contemplative.  One  ritualized

combat every year on the feast of the moon determines who

leads the monastery for the next twelve months. This combat

is  often  to  the  death,  although  sometimes  a  victor  inflicts  a

very  painful  wound  on  the  loser  as  a  reminder  and  a  lesson.

These competitions are the only time when the monks of the

order are allowed to fight each other to death.

At least three monasteries of the Long Death are rumored

to  exist  in  Faern,  each  of  approximately  the  same  size  and

population.  (The  following  statistics  are  for  one  of  these

monasteries.) In addition to the monasteries, there are proba-

bly  dozens  of  smaller  cells  of  wandering  monks  and  their

handfuls of students.

Headquarters: Firesteap Mountains, Lake of Steam.

Members: 100.

Hierarchy: Militaristic.

Leader: Lenet the Cold.

Religion: Varies.

Alignment: LE, LN.

Secrecy: Low.

Symbol: The  monks  prefer  images  of  skulls,  often  with  a

black diamond on the forehead. Many adorn their bodies with

tattoos or scars with this symbol.

HIERARCHY

Three  individuals  of  importance  administer  the  monastery.

The  remainder  of  the  monastery  residents  are  treated  as

equals, although the lesser students battle each other for infor-

mal differentiation of rank.

People of the Black Blood

ENEMIES

The  monks  are  opposed  by

benign  deities  of  life  such  as

Chauntea  and  Lathander,  and

are the enemies of the church of

Ilmater,  which  sees  their  focus

on pain and death as being only

slightly less repulsive than Lovi-

atars  love  of  punishment.

Kelemvor, the Lord of the Dead,

would prefer that they not prac-

tice their skills on unwilling tar-

gets and encourages his followers

to  destroy  these  monks  or  con-

vince them to fight undead.

Lenet  the  Cold (LE  female

human  Mnk7/Ftr4)  is  the  head

of  the  monastery.  Middle-aged

and with eyes like ice, Lenet has

held her position for seven years

in a row. She is an efficient ma-

chine  of  death  and  always  acts

completely  detached  from  her

emotions.

Tohkis (LN  male  human

Mnk5/Ftr3) is the chief trainer

of new and young students. He is

skilled at pushing people with by

applying  just  the  right  amount

of  pain  and  aggression  to  get

them  to  achieve  their  potential.

Most  of  his  students  hate  him,

but  they  certainly  respect  his

power.

Idim (LN  female  human

Mnk8)  seeks  to  constantly  ad-

vance her awareness of the mar-

tial  arts,  human  anatomy,  and

the  thin  line  between  life,  pain,

and death. She is the mentor of

all the students who embrace the

philosophy of the order.

Encounters

Monks  of  the  Long  Death  nor-

mally fight unarmed and prefer-

entially  attack  humanoid

creatures.  In  situations  where

they  must  fight  nonhumanoids,

they  are  not  adverse  to  using

weapons, particularly if their un-

armed strikes are not very effec-

tive against their foes. They tend

to  favor  the  kama  in  these  in-

stances. If they down a foe, they use the remainder of their at-

tacks against that foe to kill, or even use a coup de grace to

finish a fallen enemy.

People of the

Black Blood

It is time to hunt.

Totoruan, wereboar of the Chondalwood

The People of the Black Blood consist of several tribes of ly-

canthropic  Malar-worshipers  living  throughout  Faerns

forests.  They  revel  in  their  animal  nature,  attack  those  who

invade  their  territory,  and  enjoy  abusing  those  who  blind

themselves to all but the gentler parts of nature. The People

are  most  feared  for  their  High  Hunt,  during  which  they

kidnap a sentient being, release it in the forest, then hunt it as

they  would  an  animal.  While  Malars  clergy  normally  only

calls for a High Hunt once a season, the People choose victims

as frequently as once a month.

Brief History

Given that they appear all over the continent and have little

contact with each other, it is difficult to trace the origin of the

People of the Black Blood. In all likelihood, Malar was inspired

to bring the first tribe together after some of his worshipers

were defeated by a group of Selnite shapechangers. Knowing

as  he  does  the  value  of  hunting  in  a  pack,  Malar  probably

brought the first tribe together to kill a specific target. Since

Monk of the Long Death

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  monks  seek  to  understand  death  and  hope  to  achieve  a

perfect death. None are really sure what that means, but they

believe that by inflicting pain and death upon others with their

bare hands, they gain an understanding of what they need to

do to achieve their own perfect deaths.

The monks wander the land, accosting people in every part

of Faern with fist and foot. They have found that pretending

to be beggars allows them a great deal of anonymity and free-

dom to move about. Ironically, many folk mistake them for

the Broken Ones (monks of Ilmater), which outrages the wor-

shipers of the CryingDeity.

RECRUITING

The monks only accept about a dozen new students into each

monastery every year. These students must be lawful neutral

or  lawful  evil  and  must  pass  basic  physical  tests.  The

monastery also takes on older students, typically fighters with

an  interest  in  death  or  disillusioned  monks  of  other  orders.

They are particularly fond of teaching worshipers of Loviatar

that pain is just a short step away from death, and teaching fol-

lowers of Ilmater that suffering is only the key to understand-

ing mortality.

ALLIES

Some  of  the  monks  of  the  order  are  acquainted  with  wor-

shipers of Cyric or Kelemvor because of their past association

with  Myrkul.  Others  have  received  friendly  gestures  from

clerics  of  Velsharoon,  who  wishes  to  court  the  Long  Death

monks into his service.

People of the Black Blood

then, the groups have split and reformed, with lone members

recruiting others and some divinely inspired by Malar himself

to join under the name of the People.

The Organization

The  following  statistics  refer  to  a  single  tribe  of  the  People.

Most major forests are thought to have at least one tribe, and

the  total  population  of  the  People  is  estimated  to  be  three

thousand or more.

Headquarters: None.

Members: 50100.

Hierarchy: Loose.

Leader: Bloodmaster (the most powerful member of

the group).

Religion: Malar.

Alignment: CE, NE, N.

Secrecy: None, although the People rarely reveal their af-

filiation to those outside the group.

Symbol: While each tribe has its own mark or symbol

(often  depicted  in  scent  rather  than  visually),  each

group also tends to use some variant of the symbol

that  represents  the  People  to  outsiders:  an  abstract

humanoid  torso  with  a  large  clawed  hand  growing

where  the  head  should  be.  The  ties  to  Malars  holy

symbol are obvious, and the lower part of the symbol may

refer to blood or may simply be a spike that can be used to

place the symbol upright in the ground.

A tribe of the People of the Black Blood functions like a pack

of  animals.  They  have  little  contact  with  other  tribes  unless

called  together  by  a  great  leader  or  a  message  from  Malar.

Each  tribe  watches  over  its  territory  and  responds  appropri-

ately to outside threats.

HIERARCHY

Each  tribe  has  a  slightly  different  sort  of  hierarchy  based

somewhat upon the local Bloodmasters animals form. In gen-

eral, a single individual or a mated pair is dominant, with all

others taking commands from the leader or leaders and con-

stantly jockeying with each other for status. When a tribe has

mixed  members  (more  than  one  type  of  lycanthrope),  the

members that have the same animal form as the leader tend to

be of higher status.

The  following  are  some  of  the  better-known  leaders  of

various tribes.

Heskret of the High Forest (N male human werebat Ftr5)

claims dominion of the trees for his people. His tribe usually

fights in hybrid form (a man-sized batlike winged humanoid),

often carrying victims into the air and then dropping them.

Narona  of  the  High  Forest (CE  female  human  werewolf

Rgr6) is a lusty young she-wolf with a taste for human flesh.

Her name is well known to the people of the High Forest, and

her High Hunts are always well attended even by lycanthropes

of other clans.

Totoruan of the Chondalwood (N male shield dwarf were-

boar Bbn4) is an ugly one-eyed thug of a creature, an infected

shield  dwarf  adventurer.  The  silver  threads  he  wears  woven

into his hair and beard are still visible in his boar form, and it

appears that his teeth and tusks are turning into steel.

Vakennis of Cormanthor (NE female human werewolver-

ine Drd8) is a natural lycanthrope, daughter of the previous

Bloodmaster of her tribe. She slew her father when she felt she

was strong enough and has ruled her tribe with strength and

determination for the past four years.

Jarthon of the Moonwood (NE male half-moon elf were-

badger  Rgr5)  was  once  a  half-elf  who  used  to  hunt  lycan-

thropes to protect the people of Silverymoon. After he became

infected during a werebadger attack, he used his hunting skills

to become the leader of the local tribe. Jarthon has become a

thorn in the side of the people of the Silver Marches.

Mainu  of  Chult  (N  female  human  weretiger  Clr4)  was

abducted from her village and infected by another cleric

of Malar, who sought Mainu as a bride because of her

incredible beauty. She surprised him by tearing out his

throat on her wedding night, and then she lived alone

for several years as she grew to understand the change in

her body. She then took over the tribe that exiled the cleric.

Mainu only calls High Hunts upon those who exploit

her jungle home.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  People  wish  to  be  left  alone  to  protect  their

territory, their young, and their way of life. Their

occasional  kidnapping  and  hunting  of  innocent

people  seems  natural  to  them,  for  they  consider  any

who do not worship Malar or who live in cities to be weak

and worthy only of being prey. They do try to choose people

for their High Hunts whose absence either wont be noticed

(to  avoid  drawing  attention  to  themselves)  or  will  prove  a

point (such as a wealthy leader of a logging guild who has been

responsible for encroachment into the tribes territory).

The  People  are  a  very  localized  threat,  because  they  are

often  content  to  chase  off  an  intruder  and  leave  it  at  that.

However, those who cross them must face a group of skilled

hunters with the instincts of animals and the intelligence of

any civilized creature.

RECRUITING

The People have no interest in recruiting unless their tribes

numbers are running low. If they have a year of few births or

an unusually large number of deaths, they simply kidnap and

infect children from nearby civilizations, raising them as their

own once the transformation to lycanthrope is complete.

ALLIES

Naturally,  the  People  are  allies  of  the  church  of  Malar,  al-

though  they  often  consider  their  nonlycanthrope  allies  weak

and tainted by the constraints of civilization. They have been

known to accept employment from groups such as the Zhen-

tarim, drow, and other organizations that pass through their

territory without claiming it, but these alliances usually fade

after  a  time.  Such  groups  usually  compensate  the  People  for

their work by paying them in rare animals, magic items the

tribe can use, or young children that can be eaten or infected

with lycanthropy.

ENEMIES

The People share the same enemies as all followers of Malar,

including  those  who  destroy  their  hunting  grounds,  anyone

who represents civilization, those who espouse peace (such as

clerics of Eldath), the more benign deities of nature, and the

faithful of Selne, whom Malar loathes for her dominion of

the moon.

Encounters

The People use animal tactics supplemented by human intelli-

gence.  Ambushes  and  fast  pursuits  into  dead-end  areas  are

common strategies, as are overbearing and grappling attempts

made by multiple creatures on a single weak opponent.

Because  they  have  difficulty  using  magic  items  in  their

animal forms, the People are very selective about what items

they carry with them. Only objects that can be easily carried or

manipulated by an animal are brought outside the lair. Potions

are common items, although not usually carried in bottles

either  a  soft  flask  made  from  a  bladder  or  a  bundle  of  ab-

sorbent plant fibers is the most common form, either of which

can be chewed apart or sucked on by a creature in animal form.

Born with black and gray hair to blond-haired parents, Kyrran

appears  to  be  in  his  late  thirties.  A  natural  lycanthrope,

Kyrrans alternate form is a black tiger with dark gray strip-

ing. The clerics of Malar took his unusual coloration as a sign

and trained him closely in the ways of the Beast Lord. Now

Kyrran serves as a direct agent of Malar, ranging apart from

all the packs of the People of the Black Blood but accepted by

them  all.  He  wanders  the  High  Forest  carrying  news  and

makes sure that each pack is obeying the will of Malar. If a

packs Bloodmaster has outlived her usefulness or has turned

from  the  path  of  the  hunter,  Kyrran  challenges  the  leader,

slays  her,  and  chooses  a  new  Bloodmaster  from  among  the

other members of the pack.

When in combat and not in a challenge against a Bloodmas-

ter,  Kyrran  prefers  to  fight  in  hybrid  form  to  utilize  his

greater strength and all his magic items. He never assumes his

animal form in civilized areas unless he is sure that no one not

of  the  People  can  see  him.  In  his  human  form,  he  is  of

medium-short height, strong, and languidly postured. His eyes

are gray and his face is weathered, and his hair is unruly and

usually combed back with his fingers. An almost palpable ten-

sion hangs in the air around him, giving people who speak to

him the impression that he is very dangerous.

The Rundeen

Sudeik was pleased. Their ship was making good time, and his

shipment of Calishite silks would soon be making its way north

along the Sword Coast to Waterdeep.

Ship ho! cried the lookout.

Another merchant? asked Sudeik to a deck hand.

Probably pirates, replied the toothless old man.

Worse than pirates, said the first mate, snap-

ping  his  spyglass  closed.  Its  a  Rundeen  ship.

Damn Artak for not joining them when he had

the chance.

Whats so bad about the Rundeen?

That one pirate ship is trailing more behind it.

If they plan to sink us, we have no chance.

The Rundeen is a powerful mercantile and slaving con-

sortium  that  controls  trade  in  Chult,  Tashalar,  and

parts of Calimshan, and is working its way into Tethyr,

Amn, and other countries to the north. It protects its

caravans  with  well-armed  guards  and  sends  bandits

and pirates to attack its rivals interests.

Brief History

Originally a Tashalaran mercantile organization, the Rundeen

allied  with  the  Knights  of  the  Shield  and  afterward  rapidly

spread its influence to the north. The fall of the Shoon Empire

split the two groups again, and the Rundeen retained hold of

its businesses in Calimshan.

After suffering recent setbacks due to the Harpers and the

ruler of Calimshan, the Rundeen is trying to maintain its frag-

mentary  holdings  in  that  country  and  establish  contacts  in

Amn and Tethyr.

Organization

The  Rundeen  is  an  unusual  crime  organization.  Members  of

the  group  offer  incentives  for  prosperous  merchants  to  join

them, and for the most part the organization functions as a le-

gitimate,  if  controlling,  merchant  network.  Only  when  the

Rundeen  is  thwarted  or  sees  a  threat  to  its  business  does  it

make attacks on its rivals.

The following statistics refer to the Rundeen as a whole.

Headquarters:  Various  residences  in  Calimshan  and

Tashalar.

Members: Thousands, including the many merchants, ban-

dits, and pirates involved in or employed by the Rundeen. The

primary organization probably numbers about 3,000.

Hierarchy: Segmented.

Leaders: The Grand Yrshelem (five individuals).

Religion: Waukeen, any.

Alignment: LN, N, LE, NE.

Secrecy: Medium.

Symbol: The symbol of the Rundeen is a coin with a nail

through  it.  This  ties  back  to  the  original  meaning  of  the

name Rundeen, Safe Coin. Members also have a code sign

used to identify themselves to other members of the group:

crossing  the  wrists  over  the  chest  while  the  hands  are

clenched into fists.

HIERARCHY

At the head of the organization are five individuals known

collectively  as  the  Grand  Yrshelem.  Each  individual

controls a different aspect of the business. Below

the  Grand  Yrshelem  are  the  fifteen  First  Yr-

shelem (three serving each of the five Grand Yr-

shelem), who are responsible for keeping track of

finances,  personnel,  and  physical  assets.  The

First  Yrshelem  controls  the  Mitalibbar,  a

group with cells of agents in every city that

contacts merchants, handles payments, and

watches  for  rivals.  Few  members  of  the

Rundeen see anyone of a higher rank than

the Mitalibbar.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The Rundeen seeks profit above all else. Merchants

who  have  shown  themselves  to  be  competent  are  invited  to

join the Rundeen, which involves giving up a small portion of

their monthly revenue in exchange for protection against pi-

rates  and  brigands,  reduced  costs  for  equipment  purchased

from  the  Rundeen,  and  preferential  treatment  in  Rundeen-

170

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  3:56 PM  Page 171

The Shadow Thieves

controlled cities. Those who default on these payments even-

tually find that the Rundeen has become a half-owner in their

business.

Enemies of the Rundeen are likely to come up against ban-

dits and pirates in the employ of the Rundeen who have been

informed of the location and destination of caravans or cargo

ships. The raiders are given instructions to harass, damage, or

destroy cargo and personnel as a warning to the enemies of the

Rundeen. The organization conducts raids in Chult, Tashalar,

and Thindol for slaves, and attacks rival slaving ships on the

high seas. The group also employs several bands of mercenary

adventurers to hunt Harpers and independent groups of ban-

dits that prey on Rundeen caravans.

RECRUITING

The Rundeen only recruits merchants who are shrewd, success-

ful,  and  efficient,  and  have  businesses  large  enough  to  merit

their interest. From the bandits and pirates in its employ, the

Rundeen  expects  loyalty,  discipline,  and  the  willingness  to

follow orders to the letter and not exceed specified boundaries.

For  example,  a  pirate  ship  instructed  to  harry  a  particular

merchant vessel of a rival should not board that vessel, and pi-

rates  instructed  to  board  the  vessel  should  not  sink  it.  The

Rundeen has no interest in agents who cannot control them-

selves or who might make the organization look bad because of

their laxness.

ALLIES

The Rundeen is large enough that it doesnt need much that

isnt already provided by its own organization. However, the

group still has ties to the Knights of the Shield and hopes to

exploit those ties to increase its hold north of Amn. The Run-

deen has allied with a tribe of yuan-ti in Tashalar and is plac-

ing  pureblood  agents  in  cities  it  controls.  Finally,  the

organization has had some initial success in dealings with the

ogre  mage  leaders  of  the  humanoid  armies  that  control

southern Amn, offering to blockade the city of Murann to

prevent  Amnian  military  ships  from  trying  to  reclaim  the

fallen city.

ENEMIES

Few  of  the  Rundeens  enemies  are  important  enough  to  be

worth mentioning. Most of the people who dislike the organi-

zation  are  small-scale  merchants  with  businesses  that  rival

those allied with the Rundeen.

The Iron Throne is said to oppose the Rundeen, primarily

because both groups wish to control trade in the western por-

tion of Faern.

The Harpers oppose the Rundeens practices and its slaving

raids and have made themselves a constant nuisance.

Encounters

The agents of the Rundeen are scattered across the southern

lands  and  have  no  training  in  common.  The  only  consistent

feature about them is their equipment, which is usually of very

good quality and has been purchased at a discount from Run-

deen merchants.

The Shadow Thieves

Melcer the tailor scanned the small knot of waiting customers,

hoping to spot the one who was different from the others. There

was Lady Alcedine, wanting her daughters ball-gown altered

again (would the girl never stop putting on weight?), and next to

her  were  the  young  twin  sons  of  Sir  Fallonstone,  who  would

want  costumes  for  their  fathers  Highharvestide  masquerade

party (Ill bet they want to be a pair of knights, the tailor mused

to  himself).  The  others  he  didnt  know,  but  they  all  seemed

normal  enough.  He  shrugged  inwardly;  maybe  he  was  wrong,

and it wouldnt be today.

He  had  been  right  after  all,  but  once  again  the  courier

eluded  his  best  efforts.  He  had  just  finished  helping  a  young

woman who called herself Serria decide on a new cut for an

old dress, and she had left the garment on the workbench right

next to him. He picked it up, and there inside was the small bag

of gold coins that were his monthly fee. He thought briefly about

what he had agreed to hide, and wondered for perhaps the hun-

dredth time if he shouldnt go down there and look. What if it

was something illegal?

He shook his head to clear away those thoughts. No, he told

himself, they warned me never to go down there. I dont want to

know whats there badly enough to cross them. Humming softly

to  himself,  he  tucked  the  gold-filled  purse  into  his  tunic  and

went on with his day.

The organization collectively known as the Shadow Thieves is

the largest and most prosperous thieves guild in all Faern. Its

success is derived from its system of interlocking guilds, each

dedicated to the twin goals of profit and power. From the or-

ganizations stronghold in Amn, this series of guilds controls

the lions share of all criminal operations along the entirety of

the Sword Coast and reaches beyond that area into many other

parts of Faern.

The highly secretive nature of the guild and its operatives

ensures  that  its  members  have  limited  significant  knowledge

of  its  operations  and  their  own  associates.  The  forces  of  law

and  order  have  tried  to  pierce  the  wall  of  silence  that  sur-

rounds the Shadow Thieves, to little avail. Despite periodic suc-

cesses and the elimination of a few guilds, the organization as a

whole seems to grow stronger with each passing year.

Brief History

Five  ambitious  criminals  founded  the  Shadow  Thieves  little

more than a century ago. Their original base of operations was

in  Waterdeep,  where  they  operated  much  like  any  other

thieves guild, with one important difference: Power within the

guild  depended  on  being  related  to  one  of  the  five  founders.

The guild remained active in the City of Splendors until 1298

DR, when it was driven out by a group of adventures led by

Lhestyn  Arunsun,  the  Masked  Lady  of  Waterdeep  (and  a

distant relation of the archmage Khelben).

Nearly destroyed and destitute, the sole surviving founder

and  the  tattered  remnants  of  the  guild  membership  escaped

into Amn and regrouped in the city of Athkatla. The remain-

ing founder, Carzakh Deepshadow Halandir, swore that the

guild would never again allow itself to suffer such a disgraceful

171

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  3:58 PM  Page 172

The Shadow Thieves

failure, and also that it would avenge itself on Waterdeep and

its Lords. Deepshadow slowly rebuilt the organization, encour-

aging more diversity in its ranks and recruiting a number of

other types of professionals in addition to the required rogues.

Only three years after their humiliating expulsion from Wa-

terdeep, the Shadow Thieves were strong again. By 1321 DR,

the  organization  all  but  controlled  the  Amnian  underworld,

and two decades later it was a serious contender for control of

all illegal activity in the Sword Coast region.

Deepshadow perished during the Time of Troubles, and his

loss  was  felt  throughout  the  guild.  Fortunately  for  the

Shadow Thieves, his successor, the Grandmaster of Shadows,

proved  even  more  capable  than  his  predecessor.  The  Grand-

master added new levels of secrecy to the guilds administra-

tive structure and reorganized its hierarchy to create the now

well-established  interlocking  guild  system.  By  improving  on

Deepshadows original concepts, he was able to parlay

the  guilds  already  considerable  strength  into

something truly monumental.

The Organization

Headquarters:  The  guild  maintains  a

false headquarters known as the Shadow

House in Athkatla. This is a blind, meant

to serve as a decoy for its real central base

of  operations,  which  is  a  large,  well-pro-

tected underground complex beneath the in-

famous  Gilded  Rose  festhall  on  the  opposite

side of town.

Members: Uncertain, but probably more than 3,000 opera-

tives work for the guild at any one time.

Hierarchy: Webbed.

Leaders: The Shadow Council.

Religions: Most members of the guild at least pay lip service

to  Mask,  and  many  claim  him  as  their  patron  deity.  Others

worship  any  number  of  evil  deities,  including  Bane,  Cyric,

Loviatar, Shar, and Talona.

Alignment: LE, NE, CE, CN.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: Everyone  in  Amn,  and  many  along  the  Sword

Coast,  knows  the  mark  of  the  Shadow  Thieves:  a  black  silk

domino mask impaled on a stiletto. In actuality this symbol is

yet another blind employed by the organization to mislead its

rivals and enemies. The rank and file members of the organi-

zation are cautioned never to employ this sigil unless specifi-

cally ordered to do so. Any member of the guild who uses this

mark without explicit instructions is assassinated for endanger-

ing  the  guild  and  defying  authority.  The  body  is  normally

found the next morning . . . with a silk domino mask affixed to

the corpse with a stiletto.

The Shadow Council is absolutely fanatical about the secrecy

that  enshrouds  the  organization.  Only  the  council  members

themselves grasp the true complexity of the system and know

all  its  details,  and  only  they  appreciate  the  mind-boggling

breadth and depth of this criminal juggernaut.

Secrecy is the key to the guilds phenomenal success. The in-

dividual guilds that make up the organization are arranged and

staffed carefully so that each member knows only a few others

(generally a dozen or fewer) by name and sight. These mem-

bers work together exclusively, so that if one is captured or de-

cides to tell all, danger to the larger organization is minimized.

Only  the  members  of  the  Shadow  Council  possess  complete

knowledge of the entire operation and its agents. Even so, it

would  certainly  be  possible  for  a  turncoat  or  infiltrator  to

cause the guild a degree of discomfort.

More important, those who fail to keep the guilds secrets

generally cost the organization money, and that simply cannot

be tolerated. It therefore comes as no surprise to any member

that the penalty for betraying guild secrecy is death. However,

a  guild  member  who  maintains  guild  secrecy  in  the  face  of

personal danger, capture, or imprisonment reaps considerable

rewards. All ranking members of the guild can take comfort

in  the  fact  that  their  families  will  be  cared  for  should  the

worst happen. That policy produces a high degree of almost

familial loyalty in the inner circles. At the outer edge

of the organization, the local guilds that operate

(secretly) on behalf of the Shadow Thieves offer

their members compensation if they are captured and

punished. The wealthier local guilds also provide for a

captured operatives family if he should meet

his end.

HIERARCHY

A group that has its finger in nearly every

illegal pie from Amn to Baldurs Gate and

beyond requires a sizable number of opera-

tives  to  ensure  that  its  activities  proceed  on

track.  The  guild  is  organized  in  layers,  like  an

onion. At the center of the guild is the Shadow Council, led by

the Grandmaster of Shadow. Beyond the council are the Cloak-

masters,  senior  administrators  who  carry  out  the  Shadow

Councils  instructions.  Still  farther  from  the  center  are  the

Guildmasters, and beyond them are the Silhouettes. Finally, at

the outer layer, are the rank-and-file operatives who make up

the bulk of the guilds membership rolls.

The Shadow Council

Six men and women divide up the organizations vast territory

among themselves, and each is responsible for the guilds oper-

ations in one of these areas. All members of the Shadow Coun-

cil maintain at least three separate identities and ensure that

they  can  be  ready  to  travel  (for  business  or  escape)  at  a

moments notice under any one of a number of disguises.

Rhinnom  Dannihyr (NE  male  human  Rog15/Asn5),  the

Grandmaster of Shadows, leads the Shadow Thieves and is also

a member of the Council of Six, the ruling body that governs

the  nation  of  Amn.  He  has  assumed  authority  over  all  the

guilds most recent operations east of the Sword Coast.

Rheax  Bormul (CE  male  human  Rog9/Gld4)  controls  the

guilds  operations  in  Amn.  A  disinherited  wastrel  from  an

Amnian minor noble family, he has since avenged himself by

putting a large number of his former peers deep in his debt.

Darlan Mortem (CE male half-elf Wiz10/Sha7) is a sinister

master of the Shadow Weave who uses his position to increase

his  personal  treasure  trove  of  rare  magic  items.  He  controls

the  guilds  activities  in  the  lands  between  Amn  and  Baldurs

Gate.

Orniiv The Eclipse Fandarfall (CE male human Clr13 of

172

620_T11989_001_LoDCh02v3.qxd  8/24/01  3:59 PM  Page 173

The Shadow Thieves

Mask)  projects  the  ice-cold  and  unflappable  demeanor  of  a

true professional. He earned his nickname from the tattoo of a

partial  eclipse  on  his  left  cheek.  He  is  responsible  for  opera-

tions in Baldurs Gate.

Nulara Silversong Haphet (CE female human Brd14) has

the soul of a dark poet but the mind of a criminal genius. She

has authority over the guilds recent incursions into the Sword

Coast North. She hails from far-off Mulhorand, but refuses to

speak of her homeland.

Otleo  The  Fat  Ressmon (NE  male  human  Rog7/Gld5)

came up through the ranks the hard way, earning his guild ed-

ucation from the school of very hard knocks. He is in control

of the guilds activities in Tethyr, where he is known as a suc-

cessful merchant.

The Cloakmasters

Two Cloakmasters serve each member of the Shadow Council,

so that a pair of these senior lieutenants works within each of

the  guilds  six  territories.  The  twelve  Cloakmasters  do  not

know the identity of their counterparts, however, nor do they

know what orders or assignments their peers are given. They

communicate only with the member of the council whom they

serve,  and  those  operatives  in  the  next  outermost  layer  who

serve them in turn.

The Guildmasters

Each Cloakmaster selects ten Guildmasters who carry out the

actual day-to-day operations in each territory. A Guildmaster

commands  a  number  of  separate,  individual  guilds  operating

within his Cloakmasters area, but each of the guilds under his

command specializes in the same activity. Thus, in any given

territory, one Guildmaster is responsible for all the smuggling,

another  for  extortion  and  blackmail,  another  for  theft  and

burglary, and so on.

The Silhouettes

Many dozens of Silhouettes serve the organization, with more

added as needed. Each and every one of them is a decoy. Osten-

sibly  they  are  guildmasters,  but  in  actuality  they  control

nothing and have no authority. The sole purpose of the Silhou-

ettes is to appear as if they control guild operations, so that the

enemies of the Shadow Thieves will spy on and harass them in-

stead of identifying the organizations true operatives. A city

where the Shadow Thieves are active can have any number of

Silhouettes, each working diligently to divert attention from

the guilds true activities. Sometimes the guild even arranges

for a Silhouette to be caught, so that its opponents remain

unaware of the true state of affairs. The Silhouettes report to

the Guildmasters.

The Rank and File

The most numerous guild members are the average Shadow

Thieves.  They  come  from  virtually  every  class  and  race.  In

virtually every case, these individuals dont realize that they

work for the Shadow Thieves. These thugs, fences, confidence

artists, arsonists, and smugglers each belong to a small guild.

They report to the guildmaster, pay their dues, and commit

their  crimes  all  without  discovering  that  they  are  part  of  a

much larger organization. Sometimes a particularly skilled or

gifted member at this level is singled out for promotion and

then  reports  to  a  Silhouette  or  possibly  a  Guildmaster,  but

most of them live out their entire lives completely ignorant

of their role in the greater scheme.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The Shadow Thieves are interested primarily in two goals: in-

creasing their wealth and expanding their power. The Shadow

Council also possesses some larger political and personal goals,

but these are not shared with the common membership.

In  addition  to  their  ambitions  of  wealth  and  power,  the

members  of  the  Shadow  Council  are  determined  to  revenge

themselves on Waterdeep for the Shadow Thieves original ex-

pulsion.  The  most  expedient  and  satisfying  form  of  retribu-

tion, of course, involves reestablishing the guilds operations in

that city right under the nose of the Lords of Waterdeep, and

thats  exactly  what  theyve  been  working  hard  to  do  for  the

last  half  decade.  Their  agents  have  infiltrated  the  City  of

Splendors with remarkable success of late, possibly because the

attention  of  that  citys  Lords  is  focused  on  so  many  other

pressing problems. The only unfortunate aspect of the Shadow

Councils revenge is that they cant yet share the triumph with

the good citizens of Waterdeep. Of course, there may come a

day when the guild is so powerful that it can afford to reveal

its presence in Waterdeep with impunity, while thumbing its

nose at the Lords . . . and thats a day that the council deems

well worth waiting for.

All  the  other  members  of  the  Shadow  Thieves,  from  the

Cloakmasters to the beggars trying to cadge silver coins in the

Tethyrian  streets,  value  wealth  and  power  above  everything

else. People who have neither wealth nor power are generally

useless to guild members and therefore expendable.

RECRUITING

The Shadow Thieves eagerly recruit an unlimited number of

operatives at the rank-and-file level. The turnover rate among

these members is high, due to the naturally chaotic and tran-

sient  nature  of  the  criminal  element.  Individuals  who  show

promise are watched carefully and given increasingly greater

responsibilities at the local guild level. Guildmasters are free to

promote  from  within  as  they  see  fit,  since  all  are  ranking

members  in  the  various  layers  of  the  organization,  but  they

are responsible for the performance of their agents. Unknow-

ingly  promoting  a  traitor  or  an  incompetent  is  a  shameful

error,  and  can  delay  a  ranking  members  advancement  for

years (or halt it altogether).

ALLIES

Because  of  their  single-minded  devotion  to  secrecy  above  all

other considerations, the Shadow Thieves prefer to manipulate

and  use  unknowing  pawns  rather  than  ally  openly  with  any

group. They dislike open alliances, because such arrangements

too often give future advantage to an organization that may

become an enemy tomorrow. The only exception to this gen-

eral rule is the Council of Six, the body of anonymous rulers

that controls Amn. So great is the guilds power in the nation

that  the  members  of  the  Council  of  Six  cannot  help  but  be

aware of it, and that awareness has sparked recent discussion at

the council table. Councilor Rhinnom Dannihyr has proposed

that Amns governing body make some sort of political over-

ture  to  the  guild,  forming  an  alliance  before  the  Shadow

The Shadow Thieves

Thieves decide to help themselves to the councils power with

or  without  consent.  This  proposal  is  currently  under  debate

among  the  other  five  councilors,  who  are  unaware  that  its

main proponent is himself the leader of the Shadow Thieves.

Individual agents of the group are free to conduct whatever

business they like with any number of associates, provided that

guild security is not compromised. In recent months, Shadow

Thieves operatives have made business arrangements with in-

dividuals  who  inhabit  the  dark  undercity  of  Skullport  far

below the streets of Waterdeep, in preparation for the arrival

of a Silhouette.

ENEMIES

As  the  most  widespread  guild  of  organized  criminals  in

Faern,  the  Shadow  Thieves  also  boast  a  number  of  foes.

Anyone who has ever been wronged by the guild or been the

victim  of  one  of  its  innumerable  operations  likely  harbors  a

grudge against it (though such persons would be hard-pressed

to find a target against which to vent their outrage).

The Lords of Waterdeep are, for obvious reasons, the groups

perennial enemy, at least from a historical perspective. If the

Shadow  Council  believed  it  could  strike  a  telling  blow  against

those self-satisfied, masked rulers and still maintain secrecy, it

would  do  so  without  hesitation.  One  day  soon,  the  group  will

again be sufficiently established in the City of Splendors to begin

harrying the Lords in a more direct fashion, but for now that

pleasure must await a more fitting time. The councils desire to

sting Waterdeeps pride is strong, but not yet strong enough to

persuade the council members to risk all that they have accom-

plished in recent years on a chance for retribution.

A  more  immediate  concern  to  the  Shadow  Council  is  Syl-

Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal, the current ruler of Calimshan. The

guild has been attempting to gain a secure foothold in the Cal-

ishite underworld for several years, but events have routinely

turned against the Shadow Thieves. Their agents continuously

disappear or meet death at the hands of Calimport assassins,

and their operations regularly fail to turn the kind of profits

the  guild  has  come  to  expect,  due  primarily  to  competition

from the existing criminal operations in the city. The Shadow

Council blames the Syl-Pasha for its troubles, certain that the

cunning  master  of  intrigue  is  orchestrating  its  failures.  The

council is starting to believe that it may be necessary to create

a new position at its table, and give that individual the task of

making the guilds Calishite ambitions into a reality.

Encounters

Because  the  guilds  operations  are  so  extensive  and  its  mania

for  secrecy  so  strong,  no  Shadow  Thieves  encounter  can  be

called typical. Player characters who encounter the guild will

most likely do so either as the targets of its criminal attentions

or as prospective employees. Nearly any individual involved in

the  underworld  throughout  the  Sword  Coast  could  be  a

member of the organization, with no easy way for PCs to de-

termine that factunless, of course, the guild has decided that

its time to set up another decoy to draw attention away from

something more important in the vicinity.

The  Shadow  Thieves  greatest  strength  is  its  secrecy,  fol-

lowed closely by the sheer size of its network. The combination

of  these  factors  makes  tracking  down  and  apprehending  its

members frustratingly difficult. The belief that the organiza-

tion will punish or destroy those who divulge its secrets is so

strong among its members that incidents of genuine betrayal

are rare. More often than not, what appears to be a betrayal is

nothing more than a scheme designed to mislead and misdirect

those  who  would  harm  the  organization.  More  than  one

overeager adventurer has walked right into a fatal trap baited

with a staged confession.

This same obsessiveness for secrecy and dependence on rou-

tine  procedure  can  be  used  successfully  against  the  Shadow

Thieves. Silhouettes often do not know how to respond effec-

tively to threats that are beyond the normal range of dangers

they are taught to expect. Guildmasters and Cloakmasters alike

tend to adhere to prescribed methods of dealing with those who

set themselves against the guilds interests, but such tactics can

be overcome by opponents who dont play by the rules.

Despite  their  successes,  the  members  of  the  Shadow  Council

have little flair for tactics beyond those required to conduct the

groups  clandestine  operations.  They  have  developed  a  series  of

procedures  for  underlings  confronted  by  certain  types  of  prob-

lems (such as political interference from local governments, en-

croachment onto guild territory by a rival organization, and other

common occurrences), but have spent little consideration on how

individual  units  should  fight.  Hence,  combat  encounters  with

Shadows Thieves share few common elements or procedures.

Two tactical policies usually do prevail from unit to unit,

however.  The  first  is  a  preference  for  small-scale  encounters

on  terrain  the  thieves  control.  To  that  end,  Shadow  Thieves

are likely to attack by ambush, using spells that confuse or dis-

tract their targets while they slip into a favorable combat posi-

tion. The guilds operations provide good access to a variety of

magic items, so operatives generally carry several potions and

some  manner  of  protective  magic.  The  second  policy  is  the

guilds adamant refusal to leave living members in the hands

of enemies. If an operation or encounter goes against a guild

unit, its surviving members will do their utmost to slay any of

their  brethren  captured  by  their  foes,  using  whatever  means

necessary.  Failure  to  accomplish  this  goal  could  well  mean

their own deaths, so they are highly motivated.

Manual Appendix I.

Soft-spoken Idriane Nethis is a tall, slender woman with the

glossy black hair and beady dark eyes of a magpie. Her owl fa-

miliar,  a  dusty  brown  bird  she  calls  Xynn,  is  nearly  always

perched on her shoulder or nearby on a convenient door lintel.

The daughter of a turnip farmer on the outskirts of Soorenar,

Idriane began her career of petty theft and confidence games

at a very young age. By the time she turned 13, she was the

head  of  her  own  small  gang  of  child  criminals.  She  and  her

gang attempted one of their favorite cons against a man she

believed  to  be  a  fat,  stupid  merchant  one  fine  autumn  day,

only  to  discover  she  had  crossed  a  Cloakmaster  of  the  dread

Shadow Thieves. Rather than eliminate her, however, the guild

member elected instead to take her in hand and allow her to

become a useful member of the organization.

Most  criminals  in  the  city  believe  her  to  be  the  Shadow

Thieves  primary  agent  in  Beregost,  not  realizing  that  it  is

merely  Idrianes  job  to  make  them  think  so.  She  understands

that she is merely a blind, but her loyalty to the guild is unwa-

vering. She hopes that the guilds plans dont include throwing

her as a sop to an enemy, but she accepts this possibility as an oc-

cupational hazard. She prefers to engage her foes through misdi-

rection and distraction rather than in clashes of outright force.

Shadow Thief Safe House

This  description  is  representative  of  dozensperhaps  hun-

dredsof secret safe houses that the thieves guild maintains

throughout its theater of operation. Visitors and passersby see

only a legitimate business, which it is in all but one regard. Its

simple purpose is to provide emergency shelter and resources

to a guild member who is either on the run or in dire need of a

place  to  go  to  ground.  The  proprietor  accepts  a  reward  in

gold  from  an  unknown  individual  (usually  a  Silhouette  or

someone in a Guildmasters employ) to allow certain modifica-

tions  to  one  or  more  rooms  of  the  shop.  He  then  receives  a

monthly fee, also in gold, to look the other way when individ-

uals access the area.

The safe house described below is Melcers Fine Garments, a

tailors shop on a busy and prosperous street in the port city of

Baldurs  Gate.  The  shop  is  open  during  the  normal  hours  of

business  in  the  city,  generally  from  morning  to  evening,

though  different  opening  times  can  be  arranged  for  favored

clients.  Shadow  Thieves  who  wish  to  gain  access  to  the  safe

house  must  do  so  during  its  normal  hours  of  operation,  no

matter how pressing their need, so that they can enter in the

guise  of  a  legitimate  patron.  It  would  not  serve  the  guild  to

have  a  member  apprehended  trying  to  break  into  one  of  its

safe houses!

The Shadow Thieves

GROUND FLOOR

An average lock protects the front door (Open Lock DC 25).

The windows on this level are all barred (bend DC 24).

Workshop

Patrons gain entry to the tidy little brick establishment by

ascending a low staircase in the front and entering through

the single doorway at the top. Customers then step down to

the  level  of  the  sales  floor  and  workshop,  separated  from

one another by a low wooden wall. The shop staff is plainly

visible  over  the  wall  as  they  mark  patterns  on  bolts  of

cloth, cut fabric, sew garments, and measure customers for

new clothing.

Melcer  Wattling  (LN  male  human  Exp5),  a  stout  but

robust man in his late middle years, likes to greet his cus-

tomers  personally  when  they  enter.  The  vast  majority  of

the  people  who  grace  his  shop  with  their  custom  are  per-

fectly legitimate, but once a month a patron enters who is

more  than  he  or  she  seems.  That  customer  enters  with  a

garment to be repaired or resized, never betraying a hint of

anything  unusual  or  exceptional  about  his  or  her  request.

But cleverly concealed within the garment that the patron

leaves  behind  is  Melcers  monthly  fee,  courtesy  of  his  un-

known associates. The tailor always tries to spot the courier

from time to time, but realizes that it has never been the

same person twice. He suspects that most of the messengers

who bring the payment probably know little more than he

does.

UPPER FLOOR

Office

This area is an ordinary shopkeepers office, containing desks,

chairs, a long table with eight matching chairs, and lots of can-

dles for evenings when Melcer works late at night. The only

secret to be found here is the bottle of fine brandy that Melcer

has hidden in a bottom desk drawer for medicinal purposes.

He keeps no money here on the premises, preferring to take

his cashbox home with him after closing up for the night.

Storage

Bolts  of  cloth,  scissors,  needles,  thread,  measuring  tapes,  and

the like, as well as supplies for the office, are kept in this room.

The door is protected with a simple lock (Open Lock DC 20).

Masters Quarters

This  room  is  appointed  with  a  simple  but  comfortable  bed,

chair,  small  writing  desk,  and  wash  basin.  Melcer  sometimes

sneaks up here for a nap on slow afternoons.

Guest Room

The tailor has learned from years of experience that keeping

an  extra  room  for  the  unexpected  guest,  even  in  his  shop,  is

always a wise precaution. This room contains a simple bed, a

wash basin, and a chair.

tailor employs a cook to prepare meals so that he and his staff

can work around the clock. This dining room contains a large

round wooden table and six matching chairs.

Kitchen

This  tiny  kitchen  sports  a  cooking  hearth,  two  wash  basins,

cooking utensils, plates and service for six, and storage space

for food. It remains idle except during Melcers most taxing

times of the year.

At the end of the hallway on the upper floor is a room that is

not currently in use. Its door is unlocked. Inside are a number

of  items  that  wont  fit  inside  the  storage  room,  including  a

couple  of  oversized  bolts  of  cloth  and  a  spare  wooden  work-

bench. Built into the wall in one corner of the room, however,

is a trapdoor (Search DC 30). Pushing on the proper corner of

the door causes it to swing open, revealing a crawlspace. One

person  can  lie  face  down  inside  the  crawlspace  and  shut  the

trapdoor behind him (though doing so all but eliminates any

light  in  the  small  space).  A  narrow  tunnel  (with  rungs  for

climbing  up  and  down)  inside  this  passage  leads  all  the  way

down to the shops basement.

Secret Antechamber (Basement)

What  was  once  the  shops  basement  has  been  sealed  off,  the

original staircase removed and its opening bricked over, so that

it  can  only  be  accessed  through  the  trapdoor  in  the  empty

room on the upper floor. There isnt much here: The floor is

hard-packed earth, and the walls are bare, dressed stone. The

ceiling is barely 7 feet high, and is in fact the underside of the

wooden floor of the workshop directly above. If anyone acci-

dentally stumbles upon this place, Melcer says that he had it

bricked up because rats were getting into his workshop from

the cellar.

The basement contains nothing of interest, or so it appears

at first glance. A small concealed door lies along one wall (Spot

DC 20), measuring 5 feet square and made of wood painted to

look like the surrounding stone. It lifts out of the wall easily to

reveal  a  5-foot-high-by-10-foot-long  compartment.  The  com-

partment stores a chest containing a set of masterwork lock-

picks  in  a  handsome  wooden  case,  a  weeks  worth  of  trail

rations, a sealed cask of wine, a masterwork light crossbow and

a quiver of 20 bolts, a dark woolen cloak with a hood, a healers

kit, a disguise kit, and four potions of cure serious wounds.

The Twisted Rune

The young paladin of Ilmater kept having the same

dream.  In  it  he  saw  all  of  Calimshan,  and

within each city were the heads of the most

prominent families. From more than half

of these people extended slender threads.

Some  tied  them  to  other  families,  some

tied  them  to  people  he  didnt  recognize,

and some became a jumble of knots. He

looked  up,  and  saw  all  these  threads

rising toward a giant skeletal hand beset

with ancient jewels. Beyond the hand there

was blackness, and a pair of rotting, glowing

eyes  staring  malevolently  at  him.  He  awoke  with  a  start  and

found that his holy symbol was so hot that it nearly burned his

skin. He knew it was a sign of the Crying Deitys will, but he

did not know what it meant.

The Twisted Rune is a cabal of undead spellcasters that manip-

ulate and twist the webs of power in Calimshan simply for the

sake of entertainment. These beings have unlimited time and

vast power at their disposal, and the directing of the lives of

puny mortals pleases them to no end. Hiding behind layers and

layers of secrecy and agents, they make their existence known

only to a few, and only a handful of their minions are aware of

their connection to the leaders.

Brief History

Founded  in  864  DR  by  Rysellan  the  Dark,  an  aging  wizard

from Calimshan, the Twisted Rune was intended to be a secret

consortium of wizards that would be the real power behind all

rulers  of  the  Lands  of  Intrigue.  Although  infighting  caused

the  destruction  of  Rysellan  and  (later)  another  Runemaster,

the members of the group selected others to fill those positions

and  have  worked  together  in  relative  harmony  to  maintain

control over much of the politics in their lands.

the Organization

Headquarters: Various secret locales in Calimshan.

Members: 30.

Hierarchy: Webbed.

Leader: The Rune Council (a group of nine).

Religion: None.

Alignment: CE, LE, NE.

Secrecy: High.

Symbol: The symbol of the Rune is a gnarled sigil resem-

bling the number 3 twice, linked together with points down-

ward  like  claws,  and  the  left-hand  downstrokes  longer  than

those  on  the  right.  This  symbol  is  rarely  used  except  by  the

Runemasters so they may recognize each other in disguise, and

may be a key (if drawn in the air or engraved on an object) to

one of the portals they control.

The Twisted Rune depends entirely upon secrecy. Fewer than a

third  of  its  top-ranking  agents  know  that  they  work  for  the

Rune  at  all,  and  this  secrecy  makes  it  almost  impossible  for

good-doers  to  uproot  the  leaders.  The  Rune  has  even  been

known to hire good adventurers to further their plans, never

revealing the ultimate source of the funds.

HIERARCHY

The following are the seven known Rune-

masters, the inner circle of the Twisted

Rune.

Jymahna (NE  female  human  lich

Enc19)  was  once  a  concubine  and  was

made  into  a  lich  by  Shangalar  (see

below). She wears a magical silver mask

with  unknown  properties.  Her  ties  to

many  caravans  make  her  an  important

source of news about remote lands.

The Twisted Rune

Kartak Spellseer (CE male human lich Nec20/Acm5/Epic6)

was destroyed more than 200 years ago but was restored this

century by many carefully worded wish spells. His new body is

relatively  undecayed,  and  he  is  one  of  the  more  personable

Runemasters.

Priamon Frostrune Rakesk (CE male human lich Wiz20/

Acm4/Epic3) is a former wizard of Waterdeep who was exiled

for delving into dark magic. Priamon stole portal-building se-

crets from Halaster and is now the primary portal-builder for

the Rune. All the portals he builds have secret triggers known

only  to  him  that  allow  him  to  seal  them  with  a  word  or  to

transport the user to an alternate location of his choice.

Rhangaun (NE  male  human  lich  Wiz20/Acm5/Epic8)  is

the senior member of the Twisted Rune. Forced into the group

because  Rysellan  possessed  his  phylactery,  he  took  control

after  the  founders  death.  Dead  for  more  than  a  thousand

years, he is little more than a skeleton with glowing eyes. He

owns a staff of the magi.

Sapphiraktar the Blue (LE male ancient blue dracolich) was

made into a dracolich 300 years ago. For reasons of draconic

vanity, he carefully maintains his appearance through magic,

and therefore is indistinguishable from a living dragon. He is

slowly teaching dragon magic to Rhangaun while he plots to

destroy Jymahna, whose network of spies overlaps his own.

Shangalar the Black (LE male tiefling lich Wiz20/Acm5/

Epic2) was born the son of a cambion vizier of Calimshan. He

eventually slew his own father and ruled that country with his

childhood friend until the latter was assassinated. He wears a

cloak made of the hide of a black dragon, one of a pair that he

slew before succumbing to his wounds and becoming a lich.

Shyressa (NE  female  human  vampire  Wiz20/Acm3)  slew

the  vampire  that  created  her  and  began  to  study  magic.  She

gained a Runemaster seat only a decade ago. She enjoys playing

cat-and-mouse games with people who draw her attention. She

has created many fire spells that give off dark flames in order

to be more subtle in the night hours when she is active.

The identities of the other two Runemasters are unknown, but

they are certainly powerful undead, such as a phaerimm, a be-

holder mage, or perhaps an alhoon.

A small handful of living agents are employed to deal with

tasks such as recruiting adventurers and interacting with the

subjects of the Runes evil machinations. These agents change

from time to time, as they are killed or turned into undead

NPC Gallery: Sememmon

Once one of Manshoons preeminent students, Sememmon is

a powerful wizard, a shrewd tactician, and the force that held

the  Zhentarim  together  despite  deicide,  feuds  between  the

leaders,  and  the  destruction  of  one  of  the  Black  Networks

major  strongholds.  (See the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting for  his  statistics  and  other  information  about  him.)

When  Sememmon  and  his  cohort  Ashemmi  (LE  female

moon  elf  Wiz11)  vanished  from  Darkhold,  some  assumed

that the two had died at the hands of Fzoul Chembryl, who

always resented Sememmons quiet disapproval of his plans.

In fact, Sememmon took Fzouls ascension to the status of

Chosen of Bane and official leader of the Zhentarim as a sign

that his own career with the organization was at an end. He

and  Ashemmi  chose  to  leave  Darkhold  before  Fzoul  could

strike against them.

Sememmon has kept a low profile since leaving Darkhold.

He has no interest in returning to the Zhentarim, whether

Fzoul remains in command or not. All of Faern is open to

him now, although he has no intention of making himself a

visible target for Zhent retribution.

Sememmon knows just about everything there is to know

about  the  Zhentarim,  from  troop  distribution  to  trading

routes. What he intends to do with this information remains

the subject of debate among those who consider the affairs of

Faerns  powerful.  Should  he  try  to  use  the  information,

either for himself or as a bargaining chip in negotiations with

others,  the  Zhentarim  will  undoubtedly  respond  with  lethal

force. Semmemmon is aware that, though he is powerful, he

could  scarcely  hope  to  defeat  both  Fzoul  and  his  former

master  Manshoon.  Sememmon  may  act  in  small  ways  to

thwart  some  of  Fzouls  plans,  always  through  layers  of  se-

crecy. He might even sponsor adventurers to fight the Zhen-

tarim, or secretly plant information for the aid of people al-

ready doing so.

Sememmon  is  methodical  and  studies  any  situation  care-

fully before he acts. Between the magic he has at his disposal,

his knowledge of the Zhentarims plans, and his own genius,

he could become a powerful force for evil in Faern. Famil-

iar with commanding troops, he might assemble an army and

march on a city or fortress he wishes to conquer, creating a

new  Darkhold  for  himself.  He  might  ally  with  the  ogre

mages ruling the southern portion of Amn, providing much-

needed  discipline  to  their  troops  and  magic  armaments  to

bolster  defenses.  He  could  attempt  to  turn  the  loyalty  of

Zhentarim  agents  and  soldiers  to  him,  creating  another

schism  in  the  now-stabilized  Zhentarim,  much  as  Khelben

Arunsun caused with his withdrawal from the Harpers and

the creation of the Moonstars. As a change of pace, he might

pick a spot far from the Zhentarims control, such as Amn,

Chessenta, or Thesk, and try to establish his own guild. He

may  wish  to  contact  the  Red  Wizards  about  trading  spells

and  information.  In  all  likelihood,  however,  Sememmon  is

going to remain hidden for a time, at least until Fzoul turns

his attention to other matters.

Sememmon has become aware of the Shadow Weave and

its  potential,  but  for  the  moment  he  remains  wary  of  the

price Shar requires for its use.

When using Sememmon in a campaign, remember that he

has the benefit of genius intelligence and years of experience

leading a powerful evil organization. He only employs those

he trusts. Because of problems with Fzoul and Manshoon, he

hesitates  to  ally  with  beings  who  possess  power  equal  to  or

greater than his own for fear of being overwhelmed in a sur-

prise attack.

Rhangaun, Sapphiraktar, and Shyressa of the Twisted Rune

servants  before  they  have  a  chance  to  make  a  mistake  that

could reveal the Rune.

MOTIVATION AND GOALS

The  Twisted  Rune  controls  prestigious  families  in  Calimshan

like  a  puppeteer,  proving  its  dominance  over  others  in  some

sort of megalomaniacal game. In the nearly five hundred years

since its inception, the Twisted Rune could have placed itself in

complete power over Calimshan, but it allows up to half of the

powerful  families  there  to  remain  free  of  its  power.  This  ex-

tends the game and prevents the play and the outcome from

being too certain.

The Rune acts by sending messages through intermediaries

until  the  desired  person  is  contacted  and  convinced  of  the

proper course of action. The members of the Rune trust their

agents to know how to handle a situation. They only interfere

directly if something has gotten grossly out of hand, and even

then  only  rarely,  preferring  to  test  how  long  it  takes  the

agents to recover the situation through other methods. When

the Runemasters meet, they choose one of their secondary lairs

and transport themselves there via teleportation magic or one

of the portals created by Priamon.

RECRUITING

The Rune is willing to temporarily employ almost anyone that

suits its purposes, even those of a different ethos. Individuals

who prove useful are likely to remain employed for a longer

period of time, but only those with extremely valuable skills

are likely to be around long enough to work their way toward

the status of Runemaster.

179

ALLIES

The best allies of the Runemasters are the other Runemasters.

Because  their  lairs  are  linked  to  each  other,  if  one  is  under

attack and feeling threatened, he or she can easily escape to the

lair of an ally or receive aid very rapidly.

ENEMIES

Because they are wrapped in secrecy and lies, few know of the

Runes  existence  or  know  where  to  look  for  Rune  members

should they discover the existence of this undead cabal.

Among those who are aware of the group, Halaster of Wa-

terdeep resents their attacks on him and the pilfering of his

knowledge  of  portals  and  seeks  revenge  for  this  slight.  The

churches of Ilmater, Lathander, and Kelemvor all have their

own  plans  to  eradicate  the  Rune,  with  the  followers  of  the

Broken Deity being the most concerned since they are active in

lands where he is commonly worshiped.

Encounters

The agents of the Twisted Rune have no standard tactics be-

cause most of them are unaware of each other. The Runemas-

ters  themselves  are  all  powerful  spellcasters  and  have  had

centuries to hone their skills, learn their powers, and prepare

responses to many kinds of attacks.

All items described here follow the rules in Chap-

ter 8: Magic Items of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide.

Weapon Special Abilities

This weapon special ability is available in addition to the spe-

cial abilities listed in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide and other

sources.

Smoking: Upon  command,  a  smoking  weapon  fills  the

wielders area (a 5-foot square) with noxious smoke equal to a

stinking cloud spell. The smoke affects any creature that enters

the wielders area (such as to make a grapple attempt) and pro-

vides one-half concealment for the wielder. The wielder is not

affected  by  the  nauseating  fumes  and  can  see  through  them

normally. The smoke dissipates instantly if the wielder leaves

the  smoke-filled  square,  forming  again  in  whatever  area  the

wielder ends his movement.

A creature with a face larger than 5 ft by 5 ft. still only has

one square enveloped in smoke; only attacks that cross or enter

the smoke-filled area are subject to the miss chance.

Caster  Level:  5th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, stinking cloud; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Specific Magic Weapons

The  following  specific  weapons  usually  are  preconstructed

with exactly the qualities described here.

Banesword: These +1 lawful longswords have been appear-

ing  in  greater  numbers  in  the  hands  of  devout  Banites.

Because  the  blades  and  hilts  are  adorned  with  symbols  of

Bane,  good  folk  have  been  hesitant  to  wield  them  after

taking them from slain worshipers of the Black Lord. This

item originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

Caster  Level:  7th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, orders wrath, creator must be lawful; Market Price:

18,315 gp; Cost to Create: 9,315 gp + 720 XP.

Ebon Lash: Created by and for the Red Wizards and their

agents,  these  black  +1  whips require  any  creature  struck  to

make  a  Will  save  (DC  10)  or  be  dazed  for  1  round  as  if  af-

fected by a daze spell (in addition to normal whip damage).

Once per day the wielder can invoke a charm person spell.

Caster  Level:  7th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, daze, dominate person; Market Price: 4,526 gp; Cost to

Create: 2,413 gp + 169 XP.

Nightblade: The  Red  Wizards  make  these  +1  daggers for

their spies and counterspies. When used against opponents of

good  alignment,  the  enhancement  bonus  of  a  nightblade in-

creases to +2, and a good target hit must make a Will save (DC

16) or take 1 point of temporary damage to a random ability

score. This item originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

Caster  Level: 7th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  enervation; Market  Price: 8,702  gp;  Cost  to  Create:

4,502 gp + 336 XP.

Skull Blade: These +1 unholy longswords bear the symbol of

Cyric on the blade and hilt. Cyricists traveling incognito usu-

ally wrap the hilt to prevent the symbols from being seen, but

leave the mark on the blade uncovered.

Caster  Level:  7th;  Prerequisites:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  unholy  blight, creator  must  be  evil;  Market  Price:

18,315 gp; Cost to Create: 9,315 gp + 720 XP.

Artifacts

Storm  Star: Perhaps  two  dozen  of  these  ancient  weapons,

forged  during  Netherils  golden  age,  still  exist  in  the  City  of

Shade. The weapon is typically wielded only by members of the

noble  family  or  elite  military  officers  who  have  earned  the

favor of the High Prince. This +3 shocking burst morningstar

was a favorite weapon of the clergy of Targus. When not in use,

it appears to be a normal morningstar, but when held it crack-

les with spectacular arcs of electricity. This electrical discharge

Appendix: Artifacts

does not harm the hand that holds the weapon. Additionally,

the weapon allows the wielder to cast lightning bolt three times

per day, and call lightning once per day.

Chardalyn: First  discovered  in  a  Netherese  mining  camp

over 4,000 years ago, chardalyns are naturally occurring black

rocks that can contain a single spell. The spell is released by

hurling the rock at a target. The rock is very brittle, pulveriz-

ing into a powdery substance when struck against a solid object.

Netherese arcanists typically imbue chardalyns with offensive

spells, such as fireball.

You can toss a chardalyn up

to 100 feet with a range incre-

ment  of  20  feet.  A  successful

ranged  touch  attack  roll  is  re-

quired  to  strike  an  intended

target.  The  spell  stored  in  the

chardalyn is  cast  immediately

when  the  rock  strikes  a  hard

surface, with the same effect as

if the spell had been cast by the

chardalyns creator.

Tossing a chardalyn counts as

an  attack  action.  You  can  toss

only  one  chardalyn  at  a  time,

but you can toss more than one

each round if you have multiple

attacks.

Maguscepter:  Topped  with

the  gold-plated  skull  of  King

Thorndaer of the Golden Helm,

this  scepter  is  fashioned  of

shadow wood and engraved with

deep  red  silkstone,  a  faintly

sparkling,  fibrous  variety  of

tiger eye, to create all manner of

necromantic  runes.  The  scepter

was  crafted  by  Myntharan  the

Magus,  courtier  of  the  Shoon

Empire  who  seized  the  throne  of  Westgate  in  452  DR.  The

device owes much of its design to processes developed by the

Netherese. Orbakh retrieved the scepter from its resting place

in a secret vault under the royal palace, where it had been con-

signed  to  be  forgotten  by  the  last  mortal  to  hold  it,  King

Blaervaer Lorndessar.

This +3 heavy mace bestows one negative level on its target

whenever it deals damage. One day after being struck, subjects

must make a Fortitude save (DC 23) for each negative level be-

stowed or lose a character level. Also, each time the Maguscepter

deals damage to a foe, it stores some of the stolen life energy

within its own reservoirs. The wielder of the Maguscepter can

call on this stored energy any time that he is in direct physical

contact with the scepter. All arcane spells that the wielder casts

draw  on  the  Maguscepters  reservoirs  and  are  not  lost  from

memory. One spell may be cast in this fashion for every nega-

tive level the weapon has bestowed in the last 24 hours. There is

no  limit  to  the  number  of  negative  levels  this  weapon  can

bestow in a given time period.

Shield  of  the  Hidden  Lord: This  origin  of  this  wondrous

item  is  unknown,  though  the  sages  and  loremasters  who  are

aware of its existence suspect that it might have been first used

181

in  a  battle  on  the  Fields  of  the  Dead.  Crafted  from  pure

mithral,  the  shield  is  inlaid  with  hundreds  of  tiny  diamonds,

emeralds,  rubies,  and  sapphires  that  form  the  shape  of  a

snarling, bestial face. It is a +4 large metal shield that gives its

bearer two additional powers.

The bearer gains resistance to ranged weapons, exactly as if

he were the target of protection from arrows cast by a 10th-

level  sorcerer;  the  bearer  is  also  able  to  understand  all  lan-

guages,  as  if  he  were  the  recipient  of  tongues cast  by  a

10th-level sorcerer.

In  addition  to  its  useful  func-

tions, the artifact has its pitfalls:

Gargauth  may  communicate

directly through the shield with

anyone  within  hearing  distance

of  the  object.  He  employs  a

snarling, cruel voice when doing

so.  Any  words  spoken  within

normal  hearing  range  of  the

shield are heard by Gargauth.

While  in  direct  physical  con-

tact with the shield, the bearer is

subject to the whisperings of the

Hidden  Lord.  For  every  round

he  remains  in  contact  with  the

item,  the  bearer  must  make  a

Will  save  (DC  30)  or  be  com-

pelled to commit an act of cru-

elty or betrayal within the next

24 hours.

Rings

Faern  is  famous  for  its  magic

rings,  some  of  which  were  cre-

ated by legendary mages.

Ring of Antivenom: This ring

has 25 charges of the neutralize poison spell. The ring is acti-

vated by a command word.

Caster  Level:  5th;  Prerequisites:  Forge  Ring,  neutralize

poison; Market Price: 6,750 gp.

Wondrous Items

All of these wondrous items can be found in Faern, as well as

those  described  in  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide and  other

sources.

Drow House Insignia: These metal tokens are normally worn

on  a  chain  or  in  a  pouch  tied  around  the  neck.  Each  bears  a

symbol of a noble house from a particular drow city and requires

a  secret  command  word  to  activate.  An  insignia  has  a  single

minor magical ability that can be used once per day, usually a

spell  of  3rd  level  or  lower.  Those  belonging  to  powerful  drow

often  have  multiple  abilities  of  various  power  levels.  Typical

spells  for  a  house  insignia  are  blur,  cats  grace,  cloak  of  dark

power,  comprehend  languages,  feather  fall,  jump,  read  magic,

scatterspray,  shield,  spider  climb,  unseen  servant, and  water

breathing.

Each insignia is slightly different, even those of the same

gp (2nd-level ability), or 5,400 gp (3rd-level ability); Weight:

1/2 lb.

Fire Elemental Gem: Each of these red or orange gems con-

tains  a  conjuration  spell  attuned  to  the  Elemental  Plane  of

Fire. When the gem is crushed, smashed, or

broken,  a  fire  elemental  appears  as  if

summoned  by  a  summon  monster spell.

The elemental is under the control of the

creature  that  broke  the  gem.  Breaking

the gem is a standard action.

Drugs in Faern

Many  strange,  insidious,  and  dangerous  substances  plague

Faern, a river of death, despair, and gold flowing through the

human kingdoms and cities of the land. Some are beneficial,

sharpening the mind, reflexes, or physical stamina for a short

time at the cost of minor side effects. Many others are danger-

ous or even deadly. Those foolish (or unfortunate) enough to

partake  of  these  dark  substances  may  achieve  a  short-lived

escape from physical pain, ennui, or the harsh circumstances

of their everyday lives, but risk debilitating side effects and

in  some  casespotentially  lethal  addictions.  Some  drugs  are

sophisticated poisons that render their users nearly helpless or

susceptible  to  the  slightest  suggestions.  Drugs  of  these  kinds

are often employed by slavers, kidnappers, and other villains

to force compliance from their captives.

Drugs in the Campaign

Imaginary  drugs  can  play  a  part  in  a  roleplaying  campaign.

Certain  villains  might  employ  drugs  that  produce  stupor  or

sap the will of the heroes. The trade in destructive drugs repre-

sents a social evil the heroes can fight against, much as they

might seek to stamp out slavery or the worship of an evil deity

in an area.

Smuggling

Most civilized realms refuse to allow the sale or transport of

dangerous drugs within their borders, much as they would pre-

vent  slavery.  That  does  not  mean  that  the  demand  for  all

drugs is diminished, of coursethere are always people willing

to  pay  for  outlawed  substances,  and  smugglers  willing  to  get

rich by providing them.

Smugglers  profit  by  selling  an

item  normally  unavailable  in  an

area, whether because the item is

highly  regulated,  taxed  severely,

or  simply  illegal.  Many  smug-

glers  hide  their  contraband

among  other  items  in  a  caravan

or ship. For example, a wine mer-

chant from Tashalar might have

many  crates  of  wine  bottles,  and

hidden  under  one  crates  false

bottom are a few bottles of exotic

poison. Other smugglers focus en-

tirely  on  their  special  goods  and

have  to  move  smaller  amounts

because there are no other trade

goods to disguise the smuggled

items. In a world of magic, smug-

glers  have  an  incredible  advan-

tage  and  can  be  very  creative,

using  portals or  teleportation

magic  to  circumvent  borders,

enchantment  magic  to  make  in-

spectors  and  officials  more  re-

asonable,  or  concealing  goods

inside zombie horses, in a glove of

storing, or within a bag of holding.

Smoking sword

Listing of Drugs

In game terms, all drugs function like poisons, and allow the

imbiber initial and secondary saving throws to resist their ef-

fects. Delay poison, neutralize poison, and similar effects negate

or  end  a  drugs  effects,  but  do  not  restore  hit  points,  ability

scores, or other damage caused by the substance.

A  creature  that  willingly  takes  a  drug  automatically  fails

both saving throws. It is not possible to intentionally fail the

initial save but attempt to save against the secondary, or vice

versa. DCs are provided for situations in which a character is

drugged against his will.

Drugs are presented in the following format:

Name

The name line also gives a drugs common nickname, if any.

This line is also where magical drugs are identified as such. (If

a drug is magical, its effects go away in an antimagic field.)

Description: Information  about  the  drugs  appearance,  its

origin, and its effects.

Type: Contact,  ingested,  inhaled,  or  injury,  with  Fortitude

save DCs, as explained under Poison in Chapter 3 of the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide. Injury  also  includes  methods  such  as

pouring the drug into a wound or applying it as a poultice.

Katakuda (Dragonskin) (magical)

Description: Imported from distant Kara-Tur, this drug was

developed by an order of fighting monks of that land. It is a

brown paste that hardens the users skin. Because of its side ef-

fects, it was rarely used for training and saved for times when

Mordayn Vapor (Dreammist)

Description: Made of roughly ground leaves of a rare herb

found in southern forests, mordayn is so potent that it is taken

by steeping a small amount in hot water, and then inhaling the

vapors  of  the  resultant  tea.  Raw  mordayn  powder  and  mor-

dayn-tainted  water  are  deadly  poison;  taking  the  powder  di-

rectly or drinking the water produces an immediate overdose.

Dreammist  is  renowned  for  the  beautiful  visions  it  induces,

and the deadly peril of its sinister embrace.

Type: Inhaled DC 17.

Initial Effect: Exotic visions of incredible beauty enthrall

the user for the next 1d20+10 minutes. During this time the

user has a 50% chance to lose any action he attempts, as de-

scribed in the bestow curse spell.

Secondary  Effect:  1d4  points  of  temporary  Con  damage

and 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage.

Price: 200 gp.

Side Effects: The visions of a dreammist user are incredibly

beautiful and poignant. His normal life seems drab and futile in

comparison, and he aches to experience the transcendent beauty

of his drug-induced dreams again. When the dose wears off, the

user must attempt a Will save (DC 17) or fall under a compul-

sion to do whatever is necessary to repeat the dreammist dose

(treat this as a compulsion similar to that of a suggestion spell).

This compulsion lasts for 1d4 hours before fading.

Overdose: If two doses are taken within the space of an hour,

or  if  raw  mordayn  powder  or  mordayn  tea  are  ingested,  the

drug is a deadly poison (Ingested DC 17, 1d10 Con/1d10 Con).

Mordayn vapor addicts often throw out the tea as soon as they

inhale and make sure that only one dose is available at a time in

order to make sure they cannot overdose on the deadly drug.

Addiction: High.

Appendix: Drugs in Faern

Oruighen (Phantomdust)

Description: This drug is made by refining rare cacti found in

the alkaline sands of Azulduth, the Lake of Salt. It is a gray, fine-

grained dust normally carried in small paper envelopes. It can

temporarily  blind  and  disable  anyone  unfortunate  enough  to

inhale a pinch, and is popular with rogues and assassins who want

a way to quickly discourage those who interfere with their work.

Phantomdust is normally employed by casting a pinch in an

opponents face. Treat this as a standard action, melee touch

attack;  if  the  attack  is  successful,  the  target  must  make  his

Fortitude save or suffer the effects. If the attack misses, the

dose dissipates harmlessly.

Multiple doses of oruighen have no additional effect on the

victim until the effects from the first dose wear off.

Type: Inhaled DC 14.

Initial  Effect:  The  victim  is  blinded  for  2d4  minutes  and

suffers from an extremely painful stinging in the nostrils and

eyes.  The  pain  results  in  a  2  penalty  on  attack  rolls,  skill

checks, and saving throws in addition to the penalties associ-

ated with blindness.

Secondary Effect: None.

Price: 20 gp.

Side Effects: None.

Overdose: None.

Addiction: None.

Panaeolo (magical)

Description: This  herb  was  well  known  in  the  time  of

Netheril, but its secret was lost when that empire fell. With the

return of the City of Shade, the descendants of the Netherese

told  the  Red  Wizards  of  the  herbs  power.  The  Thayans  have

rescued small amounts of it from oases in Anauroch and have

begun to sell the drug in small quantities. Panaeolos leathery-

tasting leaves attune the user to the Weave, and boost the power

of arcane spells.

Type: Ingested DC 8.

Initial Effect: None.

Secondary Effect: The DC of all arcane spells the user casts

increases by +2 for the next 1d4 hours.

Price: 250 gp.

Side Effects: 1d6 points of temporary Charisma damage.

Overdose: If a second dose of panaeolo is taken within an

hour of the first, the increase to the users arcane spell DCs be-

comes  +3  but  the  user  suffers  2d8  points  of  temporary

Charisma damage. Additional doses within an hour do not in-

crease the DCs any more but still cause the Charisma damage.

Addiction: Low.

Redflower Leaves

Description: These crushed leaves of a tiny red bog flower

native  to  Cormyr,  Sembia,  and  the  Dragon  Coast  are  known

for their ability to improve hand-to-eye coordination.

Type: Ingested DC 10.

Initial Effect: None.

Secondary Effect: As a move-equivalent action, the user may

focus his attention upon a particular creature. If he follows that

action with an attack against that creature, he gains a +4 com-

petence bonus on the attack roll. This ability lasts 10 minutes.

Price: 300 gp.

Side Effects: None.

Overdose: Taking  a  second  dose  before  the  first  has  worn

off causes the user to be nauseated for 1d410 minutes.

Addiction: Low.

Rhul (Battlewine)

Description: A spicy red fluid with a bitter aftertaste, rhul

causes increased physical prowess and aggression at the expense

of caution and agility.

Type: Ingested DC 15.

Initial Effect: User gains a +4 alchemical bonus to Strength

and Constitution, but suffers a 2 penalty to AC. This lasts 1

minute.

Secondary Effect: User is fatigued. Taking another dose of

rhul causes the fatigue to go away for 1 minute (in addition to

the drugs normal effects). Two or more doses of rhul-induced

fatigue cause the user to be exhausted.

Price: 50 gp.

Side  Effects: Due  to  stimulation  of  the  scent  and  tactile

nerves, while the initial effect is functioning, the user prefers

to  engage  in  close  battle.  If  the  user  is  given  the  choice  of

fighting in melee or with ranged attacks, he must make a Will

saving throw (DC 16) or choose the melee attack.

Overdose: If more than one dose of rhul is taken in a period

of 1 hour, the user takes 1d4 points of temporary Intelligence

and Wisdom damage.

Addiction: Medium.

Sakrash (Twilight Mind) (magical)

saps, and certain herbs is only manufactured in Thay and Mul-

horand. It protects the users mind and thoughts.

Initial Effect: User is dazzled for 1 minute.

Secondary Effect: Cannot be detected by effects that read

or  alter  thoughts  (such  as  detect  thoughts,  zone  of  truth, and

modify  memory)  or  emotions  (such  as  emotion or  fear).  This

lasts 1d4 hours.

Price: 500 gp.

Side Effects: Because the users thoughts cannot be read, at-

tempts to communicate with the user mentally (such as with

Rarys telepathic bond, or the empathic link of a familiar to its

master) fail, even if the user is willing.

Overdose: None.

Addiction: None.

Sezarad Root

Description: The sezarad plant is a broad, vivid flower with

a short, brittle root. When chewed, the root breaks into soft

splinters in the manner of a carrot. It increases vitality.

Type: Ingested DC 14.

Initial Effect: User gains 1d8 temporary hit points.

Secondary  Effect: User  gains  1d8  temporary  hit  points.

Tekkil

Description: The fat red leaf of this succulent swamp plant

releases a milky juice when chewed. The juice is an analgesic, and

is sometimes used by people suffering from extreme or chronic

pain. Addicts who seek to numb their senses and submerge them-

selves in a drug-induced stupor use it in greater doses.

Type: Ingested DC 9.

Initial Effect: None.

Secondary Effect: The user becomes numbed to pain for 1d4

hours. Any attack, saving throw, or skill check penalties caused by

extreme pain (such as from a symbol of pain) are reduced by 1. The

user also gains damage reduction 1/ against subdual damage only.

Price: 5 gp.

Side Effects: Tekkil causes lassitude and lethargy. While the

drug is in effect, the user suffers a 2 penalty on initiative checks.

Overdose: A second dose taken while the first dose is still in

effect causes a numbing stupor for 2d4 hours. The user acts as

if under the effect of a slow spell until the stupor wears off.

Addiction: Medium.

Ziran (Bloodfast)

Description: A bitter white powder usually compressed into

a tablet, ziran is refined from several Underdark fungi by the

ing as if theyre watching themselves act from a distance.

Overdose: If a second dose is taken within 24 hours of the

first, the user suffers an additional 2 points of temporary Con-

stitution damage.

Addiction: High.

Effects of Addiction

One of the primary drawbacks of drugs is their potential for

addiction.  Some  people  reach  a  point  where  they  think  they

need the drug in order to function, and end up selling off their

material  possessions  (and  in  some  places  their  family  mem-

bers) to get their needed drugs.

Drug addictions function much like diseases as described in

the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide.  Upon  initial  exposure  (any-

time a character imbibes or applies a drug with an addiction

rating other than none) the character must succeed at a For-

titude save or become addicted, as shown below. Addiction pro-

ceeds  like  a  diseasewhile  addicted,  the  character  suffers

temporary ability damage each day unless he succeeds at a For-

titude save against the listed DC.

Satiation: Each time the user takes the drug to which he is

addicted, he is satiated and staves off withdrawal symptoms for

the given period of time. After the satiation period wears off,

the DC of the Fortitude save to resist the effects of addiction

increases  by  +5.  The  dose  in  which  a  character  becomes  ad-

dicted counts for satiation. For example, a wizard unfortunate

enough to become addicted to haunspeir (low addiction) on his

first use of the drug must make a Fortitude save every day or

take 1d2 points of temporary Wisdom damage. As long as he

continues  to  take  haunspeir  every  10  days,  his  saving  throw

DC  is  only  6.  If  he  stops  using  haunspeir  for  more  than  10

days, the DC of the addiction saving throw increases to 11.  If

he starts using it again, the DC drops back to 6.

Damage:  Addiction  inflicts  the  given  damage  each  day

unless the character succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. Abil-

ity score damage is temporary, and characters naturally heal 1

point in each ability score per day.

Recovery: If a character in withdrawal makes two successful

saving throws in a row, he has fought off his addiction and re-

covers,  taking  no  more  damage.  Of  course,  he  can  always

become addicted again later by taking another dose of the drug

and failing his Fortitude save to resist addiction.

A lesser restoration or restoration spell may negate some or

all the ability score damage caused by an addiction, but on the

next day the victim may accrue more ability damage if he con-

tinues to fail his Fortitude saves. Remove disease immediately

causes the user to recover from the addiction, but does not re-

store lost ability score points. Greater restoration or heal causes

recovery and restores all ability damage from the addiction.

The caster steals energy from others, slowing them and speeding

him or her. Targets other than the caster suffer a 2 circumstance

penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls. As long

as at least 1 enemy is affected by the spell, the caster gets one

extra partial action each round. If all the affected enemies free

themselves from the spell (by death, entering an antimagic field,

receiving a successful dispel magic, and so on), the spell ends.

This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  makes  a  combustible  object  or  a  creatures  com-

bustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp.

If  the  target  is  a  creature,  the  initial  eruption  of  flame

causes  2d6  points  of  fire  damage  +1  point  per  caster  level

(maximum  +10)  with  no  saving  throw.  The  creature  must

make a Reflex save (DC 15) or catch on fire. (See Catching on

Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.)

If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial

eruption  of  flame  inflicts  fire  damage  on  the  object  as  noted

above.  The  object  catches  fire  and  takes  1d6  points  of  fire

damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire.

Anyone  touching  the  object  during  the  initial  eruption  of

flame takes the same fire damage the object does. A Reflex save

reduces damage by half. If a creature touching the object fails

the Reflex save, it must make another Reflex save (DC 15) to

avoid catching fire.

This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

Material Component: A drop of oil and a piece of flint.

DARKFIRE

Evocation [Fire]

Level: Clr 3 (drow pantheon)

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Flame in your palm

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

Dark flames appear in your hand. You can hurl them or use

them to touch enemies. The flames appear in your open hand

and harm neither you nor your equipment. They emit no light

but produce the same amount of heat as an actual fire.

You can strike opponents with a melee touch attack, dealing

fire damage equal to 1d4 +1 points per two caster levels (max-

imum +10). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120

feet  as  a  thrown  weapon.  When  doing  so,  you  attack  with  a

ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same

damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the

flames than a new set appears in your hand.

The  darkfire is  completely  invisible  to  normal  vision  but

can be seen with darkvision as easily as a normal flame can be

seen  in  darkness  (this  means  that  darkfire can  be  used  as  a

signal or beacon for creatures with darkvision).

The spell does not function underwater.

This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

DEVASTATE UNDEAD

Necromancy

Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Components: V, S, F

This spell was created by the lich Larloch to power himself at

the  expense  of  his  own  undead  minions.  The  target  undead

creatures  must  succeed  at  Fortitude  saving  throws  or  be  de-

stroyed, just as if hit by a disruption weapon. Creatures that are

not undead, and undead with Hit Dice greater than the casters

caster level, are unaffected by this spell.

If an undead creature is destroyed by this spell, a portion of

the negative energy that gave it unlife flows back to the caster.

This negative energy deals (if the caster is living) or cures (if

the caster is undead) 5 hit points of damage per hit die of the

destroyed undead.

Focus: A disruption weapon of any kind.

DREAD BLAST

Necromancy

Level: Clr 4 (Cyric)

Saving Throw: Will half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You fire a black ray of negative energy at a single target. You

must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A

creature struck by this ray takes 3d8 points of damage +1 point

per  caster  level  (up  to  +20).  The  spell  has  no  effect  on  con-

structs or inanimate objects.

Since  undead  are  powered  by  negative  energy,  this  spell

cures them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming

them.

GREATER SHADOW TENTACLE

Abjuration (Shadow)

You create a fanged, biting mouth in the palm of your hand.

When you lay your hand upon a creature, the mouth deals 1d8

points of damage. If the target makes a successful Reflex save,

he takes only half damage.

If the target fails his Reflex save, you may start a grapple as

a  free  action  without  provoking  an  attack  of  opportunity.  If

you establish a hold, the fanged mouth sinks its teeth into the

targets flesh and continues to bite for an additional 1d6 points

of damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends.

LESSER SHADOW TENTACLE

The target shadow transforms into a thick, ropy tentacle. One

end  of  the  shadow  tentacle  remains  rooted  to  the  location

where it fell on the floor, wall, ceiling, et cetera, while the op-

posite  end  can  attack  and  curl  about  a  target.  The  animated

shadow tentacle extends 5 feet per level of the caster (up to 50

feet) from its anchoring point.

The caster directs the shadow tendril, indicating a target for

it to attack. The tentacle makes a melee touch attack using the

casters attack bonus. The tentacle does not inflict damage, but

can be used to entangle an opponent. A successful melee touch

attack means that the tentacle has entangled its victim. The

shadow tentacle is anchored, so it can hold its victim motion-

less if the caster desires; otherwise, the entangled victim can

move at half speed up to the length of the animated tentacle.

The shadow tentacle has 20 hit points, AC 15, and can be burst

with a Strength check (DC 23). A character can also free him-

self from the tentacle with an Escape Artist check (DC 20).

Changing  targets  is  a  standard  action.  When  the  caster

changes targets, the tentacle releases its current victim and im-

mediately attacks the new target. The tentacle is not affected

by bright light, sunlight, or light spells.

MYSTIC LASH

Evocation [Electricity, Evil]

Level: Clr 3 (Bane)

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Electric whip

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  a  long  whip  of  ghostly  red  energy  that  emanates

from your hand and never harms you. You wield this weapon as

if it were an actual whip and you were proficient in it. Attacks

with the mystic lash are ranged touch attacks. The lash deals 1d8

points of electrical damage +1 point per two caster levels (maxi-

mum +5). Since the lash is immaterial, your Strength modifier

does not apply to the damage. A creature hit with the lash must

make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.

If the lash hits its target, you may release it from your hand

so that it continues to attack that target automatically, leaving

your hand free. The lash attacks on your turn using your base

attack value, although it can only attack once per round on its

own. If the lashs target falls unconscious, dies, or is destroyed,

the lash returns to you on its next action. If you do not grasp

the lash on the round it returns, it dissipates, but otherwise you

can use the lash on another creature and begin the cycle again.

This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

NIGHTS MANTLE

Abjuration

Level: Clr 4

Components: V,S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You imbue a creature with an invisible shield that protects it

from all effects of sunlight. If cast on a vampire or other crea-

ture that is normally harmed or destroyed by exposure to sun-

light,  the  spell  allows  that  creature  to  function  in  sunlight

without hindrance. The spell does not overcome any aversion

the target creature may have for sunlight, however.

Nights  mantle is  not  countered  or  dispelled  by  any  light

spell of equal or lower level (such as the 3rd-level cleric spell

daylight). It can be countered or dispelled by a light spell of

greater level (such as the 8th-level cleric spell sunburst, which

both counters nights mantle and inflicts its normal damage).

Material  Component: Powdered  ruby  (value  no  less  than

1,000 gp).

Appendix: Spells

You turn aside raw earth in a furrow in a straight line, extend-

ing from your feet to a distance of 20 feet per caster level. The

furrow  measures  1  foot  deep  by  6  inches  wide.  The  furrow

ceases if it connects with a wall, large boulder, or other solid

object greater than its own width.

Medium-size and smaller creatures standing directly in the

furrows path must make a Balance check against the casters

save DC to retain their footing; otherwise they fall prone to

the ground. Creatures burrowing or buried in the earth along

the furrows line suffer 4d4 points of damage.

Netherese clerics utilized this spell to turn earth at a fast

rate in preparation for planting crops. Its use enabled them to

plant large tracts of land quickly and efficiently.

Material Component: A handful of dried corn.

SHADOW CANOPY

Evocation [Darkness]

Level: Sor/Wiz 6

Components: V, S, M

Casting  Time: 1  full

round

Range: Medium (100 ft.

+ 10 ft./level)

Effect:  Dome  25  ft.

high, diameter 100 ft.

+ 50 ft./level

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving  throw: Will

negates  or  none

(object)

Spell  Resistance: Yes  or

no (object)

You  create  a  dome  of

shadow.  The  outer  sur-

face  of  the  dome  is  im-

penetrable  to  normal

vision  and  darkvision,

granting  100%  conceal-

ment  to  creatures  and

objects within the spells

area.  A  creature  under

the  effect  of  blacklight

cannot  see  through  the

dome.  The  interior  of

the dome casts a deep shadow on everything within, reducing

the range of normal vision to 5 feet; creatures with darkvision

can see normally within the dome. Light, including sunlight,

cannot penetrate the dome. Creatures that would normally be

adversely  affected  by  sunlight,  such  as  shades  and  vampires,

are able to function normally within the dome.

You cannot cast the spell on a point in space or on a mobile

object.

All  Shadovar  expeditions  assigned  to  recover  items  from

old  Netherese  locations  include  at  least  one  arcanist  able  to

cast this protective spell.

Shadow canopy counters or dispels any light spell of equal

or  lower  level.  Light  spells  of  equal  level  have  no  effect  on

shadow  canopy, but  light  spells  of  higher  level  counter  or

dispel shadow canopy.

Material Component: A handful of coal dust and the dried

eyeball of any diurnal creature.

SKULL OF

SECRETS

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Clr 4 (Cyric)

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 full

round

Range: Close  (25  ft.

+ 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Intangible

skull

Duration: Perma-

nent until discharged

Saving  Throw: Ref-

lex half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Skull eyes spell

You create an intangible image of a floating skull that trails

black flames. The skull and its flames are obviously an illu-

sion  and  cause  no  damage,  nor  can  they  be  damaged  by  at-

tacks.  The  skull  flies  at  speed  40  feet  (perfect)  but  cannot

move more than 20 feet from its point of origin. The skull

floats about aimlessly but threateningly within its available

range.

You set two triggering conditions for the skull. The first ac-

tivates  a  message  as  if  the  skull  were  a  magic  mouth. The

second causes the skull to spit a tongue of flame 5 feet wide

and  10  feet  long  that  deals  1d8  points  of  damage  per  two

caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the creature that triggered it

and  any  others  in  the  area.  Those  affected  can  make  Reflex

saving throws for half damage.

620_T11989_001_LoDCh03v3.qxd  8/23/01  1:03 PM  Page 189

Appendix: New Feats

The triggering conditions can be the same for both effects,

which would cause the skull to spit flame and speak its message

at the same time. Once both triggering conditions have been

met, the skull disappears. The skull can only do each effect one

time, so if it has already spoken its message it does not speak it

again if the message trigger occurs a second time.

This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

STASIS CLONE

Necromancy

Level: Sor/Wiz 9

As clone, except that if the original individual is still alive, the

cloned body falls immediately into stasis and does not rot. If

the original individual later dies, the soul transfers to the stasis

clone, which leaves stasis and immediately begins to function as

per the normal clone spell.

If multiple stasis clones exist for the same original creature

when it is slain, the soul goes into the most recently created

stasis clone.

STONE WALK

Transmutation [Teleportation]

Level: Clr 6 (Bane)

Components: V, S, M (see text)

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Stone touched

Duration: Permanent until discharged

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

You magically link one location to another so that you or an-

other may speak a command word at one end and be teleported

to the other end.

Before you cast the spell you must prepare the ends of the

link, both of which must be areas of stone 5 feet square. This

preparation takes 1 hour, and functions for repeated castings

of the spell as long as the stones are not damaged.

When the spell is cast, the stones become attuned to a com-

mand word you designate. Any creature that speaks the com-

mand word while standing upon one of the stones is teleported

without  error  to  the  other  end  instantaneously.  The  stones

function  once  for  every  four  caster  levels,  and  can  carry  50

pounds  per  caster  level  each  time.  Creatures  that  exceed  the

weight limitation are not transported and count as one of the

uses of the spell.

Material Component: The preparation of each of the ends

of the link requires a paste made from rubies and amber worth

2,500 gp. Casting the spell requires a 2,500 gp diamond. Acti-

vating one of the linked stones once the spell is cast does not

require any material component.

This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faern.

TRIPLE MASK

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Clr 7 (Cyric)

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Three shadow duplicates

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with)

Spell Resistance: No

You  create  three  shadow  duplicates  of  yourself;  they  look,

sound,  and  smell  like  you  but  are  intangible.  You  can  switch

your  perceptions  between  any  of  the  shadows  and  your  own

body as a free action on your turn. When you use the percep-

tions  of  a  shadow,  it  mimics  your  actions  (including  speech)

unless you concentrate on making it act differently. Any shad-

ows  you  are  not  controlling  remain  inert.  If  you  desire,  any

spell  you  cast  whose  range  is  touch  or  greater  can  originate

from the controlled shadow instead of from you. (The shadows

are quasi-real, just real enough to cast spells that you originate.)

A  shadow  can  cast  spells  on  itself  only  if  those  spells  affect

shadows.

The  shadows  act  similar  to  the  servant  conjured  by  an

unseen servant spell. They are mindless, so while they can per-

form simple tasks such as opening doors, they cannot perform

complex tasks such as puzzle solving.

A controlled shadow can also be programmed to move in a

particular  direction  or  to  a  location  you  know.  It  moves  at

your  speed  and  continues  to  move  in  this  manner  until  it

reaches its destination or you shift your perceptions to it and

program it to go somewhere else.

If you use dimension door, teleport, plane shift, or a similar

spell that removes you from the same plane as the shadows,

even momentarily, the spell ends.

Normally this spell is used to give you several false bodies to

use at once, with one as a safe haven for casting spells (similar

to project image) and the other two acting as distractions.

New Feats

ESCHEW MATERIALS [METAMAGIC]

You can cast spells without material components.

Prerequisites: Any other metamagic feat.

Benefit: A spell cast with Eschew Materials can be cast with

no material components. Spells without material components

are  not  affected.  Spells  with  material  components  having  a

cost of more than 1 gp are not affected. An eschewed spell uses

up a spell slot zero levels higher than the spells actual level

(the same level as the original spell).

This feat originally appeared in Tome and Blood.

PHALANX FIGHTING [FIGHTER, GENERAL]

You are trained in fighting in close formation with your allies.

Benefit: If you are using a large shield and a light weapon,

you gain a +1 armor bonus that stacks with the bonus provided

by armor and shield.

In addition, if you are within 5 feet of an ally who is also

using a large shield and light weapon and who also knows this

feat, you may form a shield wall. A shield wall provides one-

quarter cover (+2 to AC and +1 on Reflex saves) to all eligible

characters participating in the shield wall.

TATTOO MAGIC [ITEM CREATION]

You can create tattoos that store spells.

Soliders using the Phalanx Fighting feat

Prerequisite: Craft  (calligraphy)  or  Craft  (painting)  skill,

spellcaster level 3rd+.

Benefit: You can create single-use magic tattoos.

You can create a tattoo of any spell of 3rd level or lower that

you  know  and  that  targets  a  creature  or  creatures.  Creating  a

tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a

corporeal  body.  When  you  create  a  tattoo,  you  set  the  caster

level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in ques-

tion  and  no  higher  than  your  own  level.  The  base  price  of  a

tattoo  is  its  spell  level   its  caster  level   50  gp.  To  create  a

tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up

raw materials costing half this base price.

When you create a tattoo, you make any choices that you

would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the

tattoo  is  the  only  one  who  can  activate  it  and  is  always  the

target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to

touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be

empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not

draw an attack of opportunity.

Any tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material compo-

nent or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition

to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the

material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo.

Normally  a  magic  tattoo  uses  a  magic  item  space  on  the

creatures body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of

its hands could not gain the benefits from a magic glove on

that hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back

does not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle.

In effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item worn on

that part of the body, negating the effects of all other items. A

tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but

the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value.

A magic tattoo can be erased with an erase spell as if it were

magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it.

Alchemical Items

Prices for the items described here are shown on the Alchemi-

cal Items table. In all cases, a successful Alchemy check against

the DC given in an items description allows the creation of a

single dose or application of the item.

Flashpellet: You can throw this small alchemical bead as a

grenadelike  weapon  (see  Grenadelike  Weapon  Attacks  in  the

Players Handbook). When it strikes a hard surface or is struck

sharply, it ignites with a bright flash. Creatures within a 10-

foot radius must succeed at Reflex saves (DC 15) or be dazzled.

A  dazzled  creature  suffers  a  1  penalty  on  attack  rolls.  The

creature recovers in 1 minute. Sightless creatures are not af-

fected by the flash.

The Alchemy DC to make a single flashpellet is 25.

Glowpowder:  This  luminescent  dust  clings  to  surfaces  and

creatures, making them glow. The grains of powder glow about

as brightly as sparks from a campfire. They dont provide illu-

mination, but they are noticeable. When sprinkled on an object

or surface, the powder helps reveal edges and details, granting a

+2  circumstance  bonus  on  Search  checks  made  on  the  treated

area. A creature sprinkled with the powder is likewise easier to

detect: Spot checks to see the creature gain a +2 circumstance

bonus.  An  invisible  creature  sprinkled  with  the  dust  has  only

620_T11989_001_LoDCh03v3.qxd  8/23/01  1:05 PM  Page 191

Appendix: Alchemical Items

one-half concealment (20% miss chance instead of 50%). Once ap-

plied, the dust clings and glows for 1 minute. A creature sprinkled

with the powder can wash it off by taking a full-round action.

The powder usually comes in a tube that allows the contents

to be blown or shaken out. Blowing out the powder is a stan-

dard action that draws an attack of opportunity and creates a

10-foot cone. If carefully sprinkled, the powder can cover 125

square feet (five 5-foot squares). It takes a full-round action to

shake out enough powder to cover a 5-foot square.

The Alchemy DC to make one tube of glowpowder is 20.

Healing Salve: Rubbing this stinky green paste into wounds

promotes  rapid  healing.  Applying  the  salve  is  a  full-round

action. One dose cures 1d8 points of damage to a living crea-

ture. Only one dose may be applied per round, and there is no

limit on how many salves can be applied over time.

The Alchemy DC to make one application of healing salve is

25. If you have 5 or more ranks in Profession (herbalist), you get

a +2 synergy bonus on checks to craft it.

Phantom Ink: This substance is similar to disappearing ink

(described  in  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Setting).

Messages written with this ink vanish from view at the end of

an hour and thereafter can be read only under the right kind

of light. The usual types specify one of the following: firelight

(which  includes  candles,  torches,  and  other  flames),  magical

light  (which  includes  the  dancing  lights,  light, and  continual

flame spells), moonlight, and starlight (this last usually isnt

discernible unless the reader has darkvision).

The Alchemy DC to make one vial of phantom ink is 20.

a +2 circumstance bonus on any check that deals with holding

onto something, including Climb checks and grappling. When

applied to a rope, it confers a +2 circumstance bonus on Use

Rope checks that involve tying knots or binding creatures or

objects. Applied to the soles of ones footwear or feet, it confers

a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance checks made to avoid slip-

ping. Once applied, suregrip lasts 10 minutes.

The Alchemy DC to make one application of suregrip is 20.

Witchweed Stick: This paste, which smells like tobacco, is re-

fined from the stalks and leaves of the witchweed plant. It is

packed into thick paper tubes about the size of a smokestick.

When ignited it creates a 10-foot cube of light smoke that pro-

vides no concealment. Anyone attempting to cast arcane spells

within the smoke must succeed at a Concentration check as if

casting defensively (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the

spell  is  lost.  The  smoke  loses  its  alchemical  abilities  after  5

rounds, and dissipates normally.

The alchemy DC to make one stick of witchweed is 20.

Realms Personality: Ashemmi

Realms Personality: Ashemmi

A Web Enhancement for Lords of Darkness

By Sean K Reynolds

The elf called Ashemmi is best known for her high rank in Darkhold, the Zhentarim fortress looming over the

Western Heartlands, and for her long-term association with Sememmon. However, little is known about her

background, and her habit of changing her appearance slightly every few months serves only to add to the

confusion. She has been described as a sun elf, a moon elf, and even a half-elf on occasion (although in recent

years she has insisted she is a moon elf), but nobody knows which is the truth. One of the more interesting

rumors is that she fled Evermeet when she turned to evil and is a sun elf noble of that land. Only Ashemmi can

dispel these rumors, and, since her current whereabouts are unknown, it will remain a mystery.

For many years Ashemmi was one of the top Zhentarim agents at Darkhold, using her charisma, power, and

Sememmon's backing to work her way to the upper levels of the castle's hierarchy. When Fzoul became the

Chosen of Xvim (and then the Chosen of Bane), she and Sememmon realized that they would not be powerful

enough to block him should he wish to rule all of the Zhentarim, so they fled for their lives. Since their

disappearance, people matching their general descriptions have appeared in Waterdeep, Westgate, and

Starmantle, although they are traveling in disguise and those sighted may be impostors.

Ashemmi and Sememmon are totally loyal to each other, and Ashemmi would never consider betraying him.

Their current plans revolve around survival, acquiring magic, and possibly thwarting some of Fzoul's plans. She

and her lover are very intelligent and would not confront any of their old enemies directly if they thought that it

would put them at serious risk. They are likely to work through intermediaries, including adventuring parties,

using their magic to find weak points in Fzoul's plans and send hirelings to exploit those weaknesses.

Ashemmi is normally described as a beautiful elf with flaxen hair and gold eyes (very rare for a moon elf but

common for a sun elf, causing much of the confusion about her heritage). She prefers to dress attractively, even

when on the road, and she favors jewelry (magical and mundane) and fiery red gowns. Although she is as evil

and ruthless as any agent of the Zhentarim, she regrets that evil often comes in an ugly shell and dislikes

associating with people whose inner evil is reflected in their outer appearance.

Because she has studied Sememmon's spellbook and is completely familiar with it, she may prepare spells from

his spellbook as easily as she does from her own. The spells listed above are ones that she is known to cast,

but because of her time at Darkhold and association with Sememmon, it is likely that the above list is less than

half of her true repertoire.

Realms Personality: Malark

Realms Personality: Malark

A Web Enhancement for Lords of Darkness

By Sean K Reynolds

Born and raised in Amn, Malark Skyborn was the middle son of a moderately prosperous merchant house.

Although primarily a trader of weapons, Malark's father did some business on the side smuggling Faernian

drugs from Calimshan into the North, and through these contacts young Malark was exposed to some of the

more disreputable characters of Faern. One of these was Kolis, a not-too-bright cleric of Cyric from the Dragon

Coast. Kolis indoctrinated Malark into the church of Cyric, and although Kolis was killed in one of Cyric's many

purges in the past decade, he fixed the teachings of Cyric (before his madness) in the mind of young Malark --

particularly the need for secrecy and glibness.

Malark traveled alone in the guise of a peddler and blacksmith, using his skills to create tools and weapons and

sell them to people he met in various small towns. He used these travels to study people in detail. With his

change self domain spell, he murdered lawful and good individuals in these towns in the guise of another one of

the townsfolk. Later he spent time as a mercenary, concealing his spellcasting abilities and pretending to be a

mere swordsman. Presenting a friendly and jovial air, he has many allies and acquaintances across Faern.

Sheltered from the infighting of the main body of Cyricists, Malark never realized that bonds of family and friends

were things to be avoided or exploited, so he can be genuinely affectionate toward these people, and he

becomes angered when they are harmed.

Because he traveled alone (or at least without other Cyricists) for most of his early career, he escaped the many

purges that Cyric inflicted upon his own worshipers, and so he is one of the more powerful Cyricist clerics not

associated with any particular temple. Cyric prefers him to remain unassociated with any temple, and some

Cyricist clerics resent this odd form of favoritism, which only cements his desire to avoid others of his faith.

Malark remains a lone wolf (other than occasional hirelings), wandering about the world, killing enemies of Cyric,

spreading lies, and avenging attacks on his friends and allies. He is particularly interested in the fate of his

younger brother Marrik (N male human Ftr6), a mercenary who is unaware of Malark's religious inclinations. If

something were to happen to Marrik, Malark would find the ones responsible and hunt them down (after

arranging to have Marrik raised from the dead, of course).
