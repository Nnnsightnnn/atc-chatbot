     Stage 1

        The novel ends with (insert) ending.
        Here is an example of how this prompt template could be used to

        travels to a faraway land in search of a cure for her dying father."
        The novel is set in a medieval fantasy world.
        The main character is a young woman named Anya.

        Anya's obstacles are the dangers of the journey,
        the evil forces that are trying to stop her,
        and her own doubts and fears.
        Anya's allies are her friends and family,
        the people she meets along the way, and her own inner strength.
        Anya's enemies are the evil forces that are trying to stop her,
        and her own doubts and fears.
        The novel ends with Anya finding a cure for her father and saving his life.
    Stage 2 
        Utilizing the response from above as seed text...create a detailed plot for a novel.
        De-limit the plot with a new line to idicate when new part should start to the novel.
