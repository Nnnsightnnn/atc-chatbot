The storm was created by the rogue celestial beings, who were using their dark magic to try and destroy Elysium once and for all.\n\nBut the Celestial Lion and his companions were not afraid. They stood together, united in their purpose, and used the knowledge they had gained from the tome to defeat the storm and banish the rogue celestial beings forever.\n\nAnd so, the Celestial Lion and his Five Companions had saved Elysium from destruction, and had discovered the truth about their origins.
