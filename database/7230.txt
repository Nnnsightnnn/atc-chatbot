CHAPTER 2. EQUIPMENT AND AUTOMATION

Section 1.  Air Traffic Specialist Workstation (ATSW)

2-1-1. RESPONSIBILITIES CONCERNING EQUIPMENT AND AUTOMATION.

a. All control room personnel have the following responsibilities concerning ZTL equipment

and automation.

1. Know the operational capabilities, limitations and setup procedures of the equipment

located at the control position, including, but not limited to the Enroute Automation Modernization

(ERAM) console, ERIDs, and all communications equipment.

2. Be familiar with the operational status of  En Route Decision Support Tool (EDST) and

Automated Radar Terminal Systems (ARTS) equipped facilities associated with each control

sector.

3. Be capable of transmitting all valid message types from the operational position during

automated operations.

4. Report any identified anomaly to the Operations Supervisor In Charge (OSIC) or Watch

Desk (WD).

b. The Airspace and Procedures Office Manager (ZTL-530) acts on behalf of the facility

manager on all matters concerning automation within ZTL.   ZTL-530 provides the automation

manager all information required to incorporate local airspace requirements into the NAS program

in a timely manner.

c. The Training Program Manager (ZTL520) provides training for control room personnel in the

use of the automation equipment.

2-1-2. COMPUTER MESSAGE INPUTS

Personnel entering messages into the operational Enroute Automation Modernization (ERAM)

computer system are responsible for the validity of the data entered.  Personnel shall ensure that the

message type is correct for the data being entered and that the data is entered in the proper format.

Personnel utilizing the operational ERAM computer system need to be keenly aware of the

importance of preserving and maintaining the integrity of the tracking and flight plan databases

used by these computers.  Safety related functions (i.e., conflict alert, E-MSAW, Mode C Intruder,

are totally dependent on tracking and flight plan data for prediction purposes.  Personnel who are

unsure of proper message types, formats, or the results of messages entered should seek assistance

prior to making computer entries.

a. The flight plan database shall always reflect the status of the aircraft unless otherwise

specified by facility directive.

2-1

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

b. Report suspected computer problems or incorrect computer message entries (which cannot be

resolved by the entering position) to the OSIC or WD.

2-1-3. RADAR CONSOLE SETUP

The user shall set up the ERAM console in accordance with the standard listed in Appendix 22.

Because of the flexibility of the ERAM program, the optional adjustments may be made to certain

controls to meet current and changing situations.

a.    Altitude limits, displayed on the Main Display Monitor (MDM), must include as a

minimum the altitude stratum of the sector plus, 1200 feet above the highest and below the lowest

altitude or flight level of the sector when all airspace is at or below FL290, or 2200 feet when sector

contains airspace above FL290. The Mode “C” intruder logic was specifically designed as a safety

feature to alert the controller that an unexpected aircraft has entered their sector’s airspace.

Examples: Ultra Low Sectors – 000B112 (1200 ft. above), Low Sectors – 098B242 (1200 ft. below

and 1200 ft. above), High Sectors – 228B362 (1200 ft. below and 2200 ft. above), Ultra Sectors –

328B999 (2200 ft. below)

b. All sectors that work airspace up to and including FL230 must enable the NON ADS-B

button under the DB Fields button of the toolbar.  This will display an A on the target symbol to

denote a NON ADS-B aircraft on the scope.  Additionally at the controllers option the ADS-B

button may be displayed on the EDST.

c. All sectors that work airspace outside Class A airspace must enter beacon codes 1200, 1202,

1255, 1277, and 4000 in the sector’s Code Select List (CSL).

d. Display altimeter stations required for your sector.

e. Enter any sector/facility to which you desire to inhibit automatic handoffs.

f. When initially opening or closing a sector, ensure that the appropriate frequencies are turned

on in the Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS) and the “call forward” has been disabled.

g. Controllers shall ensure that, as a minimum, Weather and Radar Processor (WARP)

NEXRAD levels 1, 2, and 3 are selected at all active ERAM positions.

1.  WARP NEXRAD settings within Atlanta ARTC Center:

2.  When advised of NEXRAD outages affecting a particular sector/area, controllers shall

ensure that the WX1 and WX3 keys are selected.

3.  The brightness of the NX and/or WX display(s) shall be set to level that is viewable by

all members of the sector team and the OSIC.

2-1-4. USER PREFERENCE SETS

a. Changes to existing or establishing new User Profiles must be accomplished utilizing the

Watch Desk ERAM Console (Sector 60).  The WD shall:

1.  Ask the Service Operation Center Position (SOC) to enable security for Sector 60 only.

2.  LOGIN (not Sign In) at the Sector 60 Workstation or R-side with user profile name:

LI (user profile name [usually operating initials]) <enter>

3.  Enter your “strong” password.

Ex: RADAR+001 <enter>

If the system asks you to reset password, re-enter the LI command with user profile name (as in

step 1). When asked again for a password, type in old password followed by a slant then a new

password, another slant, and the new password again. Ex:

RADAR+001/RADAR+002/RADAR+002 <enter>

Asterisks will appear as you enter the passwords. In the example above, the new “strong” password

is RADAR+002, and the simple password (used to save/delete preference sets) is RADAR.

4.  After login, a security message will be shown.  This completes ERAM log-in. Deletions,

additions, or changes to the preference settings may now be made using the following guide:

NOTE:  __ indicates operating initials.  The generic password is RADAR.

(a)  ADD A NEW USER:  UP A __ R enter, and then enter the user's password.

(b)  DELETE AN EXISTING USER:  UP D __ enter.

(c)  CHANGE AN EXISTING PASSWORD:  UP P __ enter, and then enter the new

password.

5.  After entries are complete, log out of the ERAM system by typing LO (user profile

name) <enter>.

6.  Advise the SOC to disable security on Sector 60.

2-3

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

b. Changes to preference settings can be made from any ERAM console, and do not require

logging into the ERAM system.  This includes password changes.

1.  If you are logging into the ERAM console initially with the generic password of

“RADAR”, it is highly recommended that the controller then create a personal “strong” password

that can be easily remembered.  A recommended “strong” password consists of operating initials

and the last 4 digits of their social security number.  Ex: AB1234

2.  To invoke an existing preference set:  UI __ enter.

3.  To save the current settings on the ERAM console for that user:  US __ enter, and then

enter the user's password.

Section 2. EnRoute Automation Modernization (ERAM)/

EnRoute Decision Support Tool (EDST)

2-2-1. ERAM/EDST PROCEDURES.

The following ERAM Procedures are common to all control sectors/areas of ZTL:

a. Operate on Active Channel unless operational necessity dictates operating on the Backup

Channel.  Return to Active Channel as quickly as possible.

b. Acknowledge status and outage messages(s). When the RA-Position is combined at the R-

Position, these messages must be acknowledged on both positions.

c. All OSIC’s and the WD must follow the appropriate outage procedures as specified in facility

811 training.

d. Controllers must use the ERAM Controller Immediate Action Outage quick reference card

when responding the following outages:

1.  Position display application failure – Large red X or BARCO logo on scope.

2.  Not Receiving RADAR Data Banner – Outage button turns yellow and the banner is

across the middle of the scope.

3.  Flight data down – Outage button turns red.

4.  Conflict Alert (CA) down and/or Mode C Intruder (MCI) down and/or E-MSAW (EM)

down - Status button turns yellow.  CA Down and/or MCI Down and/or EM Down appear in Status

View.  For CA Down, Conflict Alert View Header coded yellow.

2-4

1/1/2023

2-2-2. EDST ENTRIES.

ZTL 7230.2Q

a. Controllers must complete EDST entries in the following manner:

1.  The EDST aircraft list shall be the primary source of flight plan information, and the

primary display at the sector.  At sectors where automated coordination with an external facility is

not available, or when EDST is unusable, the sector team shall maintain flight progress strips in

accordance with (IAW) Federal Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) 7110.65, Air Traffic

Control, and this order.

2.  Route Action Notification (RAN) may include embedded route text (preferential routing),

ATC  preferred  routes,  and  route  processing  errors  (XXX  or?).    The  first  sector,  which  displays

Embedded Route Text (ERT) coding, must clear the aircraft via the ERT routing and acknowledge

the issuance in EDST. The requirement to issue ERT routings may be suspended on midnight shift

operations depending on specific airport requirements.  All ERTs must be acknowledged or amended

prior to the aircraft departing ZTL airspace.  Because of national adaptation, a controller may see

XXX or ??? In routes of flight that are well downstream of ZTL airspace. XXX in routes need to be

corrected only up to the first fix outside your airspace.

3.  Each ZTL sector is authorized to select Drop Track Delete under conditions where Drop

Track is not executed until the flight has exited the center or when retention of the flight plan in the

Aircraft List is not required for identification purposes.  A ‘Keep’ action can be used for individual

flight exceptions.

4.  Controllers must display the hold view on the MDM anytime aircraft are in holding.

5.  Controllers must complete position relief briefings with the Outage and Status Views

displayed and all sub lists expanded to ensure all outages are briefed.  When the Radar Associate

(RA/D-Side) is combined on the Radar (R) position, views on both positions must be displayed to

ensure a complete briefing.

6.  Temporary macros (macros not saved to a preference set) must be identified in the

position relief briefing.

7.  Preference sets should be named to reflect the sector so that any operational personnel

can look at a preference set list and invoke the desired sector.

8.  When a channel promotion takes place:

(a)  Controllers working an active sector must switch to the applicable channel (A or B).

(b)  The OSIC must switch all inactive sectors and ATSW’s to the applicable channel

(A or B).

9.  Controllers must coordinate with the affected facility prior to asserting track control (i.e.

/OK).

indicate a data block has been forced to the designated sector.  The indicator shall not be changed

until coordination is complete.  Changing these characters to white shall indicate that the point-out

has been approved by the designated sector.

11.  Although the Inappropriate Altitude for Direction of Flight (IAFDOF) Automatic Mode

is preferred, the IAFDOF Manual Mode may be utilized at any sector.  The use of the IAFDOF

Manual Mode shall be coordinated with all sector team members.

12.  When Atlanta-Hartsfield Airport (ATL) changes to and from an east/west operation,

changes also occur to the airspace within ZTL and the controller pref sets are impacted. To ensure

the sector airspace maps and pref sets are synchronized with the current direction of operation at

ATL, controllers that are impacted by a direction change at ATL must:

(a)  Invoke the correct pref set for the current direction of landing when the directional

banner changes.

(b)  Ensure the correct map is in use when acknowledging the map mismatch banner.

13.  A report will be printed on the WD ERAM Support Local Area Network (LAN) printer

Personnel working the WD position when the report is generated must take appropriate action to

resolve the issue(s) defined in the report.

14.  Stuck flight plans can cause a degradation of ERAM processing.  If this degradation

occurs, the OM must run a stuck flight plan report to determine whether any flights may be having

an impact on the system. To run a report, log onto the offline system, click on “View Stuck

Flights”, and then type, “P” and “ENTER”. The report will be generated on the WD printer. The

report will display flight plans that have been stuck for at least an hour. The WD must take

appropriate action to resolve the issue(s) defined in the report.

15.  Military Special Activity Airspace (SAA) Flights:

(a) Flights remaining under ZTL radar control while operating within Special Activity

Areas will become a FREE track after passing the delay fix.  When the flight recovers, ensure that

the tracking mode is returned to FLAT track by updating the flight plan from the "R" or "D"

position.

(b) If the flight is under other than En Route Center radar within SAA, ZTL controllers

may drop the track after handoff to Air Defense Command (ADC), or radar service termination, as

appropriate.  When the flight recovers, or is handed off by ADC, start a track and update the flight

plan, as appropriate, to ensure FLAT track.

WD.

3.   When not in use, the tracker position shall be call forwarded to the D-side.  The D-side,

when not in use, shall be call forwarded to the R-side.

4.  When a sector is combined, without a reconfiguration, the transferring sector will call

forward the R-side to the receiving sector D-side and deselect the frequency receivers.

5.  When an OSIC performs a reconfiguration, that supervisor shall ensure that all positions

that are affected are call forwarded correctly and receivers are deselected, as appropriate.

6.  When conducting position relief complete the following:

(a)  When being relieved, the relieved supervisor shall log off the VSCS workstation

and the relieving supervisor shall, if appropriate, log on.  At the end of each evening shift, the

departing supervisor shall forward all calls to the WD position and log off the VSCS workstation.

(b)  The controller being relieved should identify any problems or unusual conditions

associated with VSCS.

2-4-4. VSCS TRAINING AND BACKUP SWITCH (VTABS)

a. General.

1.  VTABS will support fifty (50) positions.  Forty eight (48) are located in the control

room, one at the SOC and one at the maintainer’s workstation.  The VTABS PEM’s are located at

the data positions and utilize the same peripheral equipment (i.e., VDM’s, speakers, VIK, etc.) as

the VSCS.  A sector cannot be transitioned to VTABS independently.  It requires all VTABS

positions to be transitioned simultaneously via a Bulk Transfer Switch located at the SOC desk.

2.  There are four workstations provided with VTABS.  They are located at the DEO Office,

WD desk, SOC desk and the Maintainer workstation.  Any modifications (i.e. temporary

modifications) to a sector map must be done from one of these workstations.

3.  VTABS configuration mapping should be defined to include all available resources for

the area at each position.  The VTABS maps should be updated whenever there are changes to the

VSCS configuration maps.  Any requests for changes to the VTABS maps shall be submitted in

accordance with procedures outlined in VSCS/VTABS Map Change Request Procedures (par.  2-4-

5).

b. Normal communication outage procedures shall be followed; i.e., OSIC notifies the SOC.

Supervisors and controllers shall not use the FAIL TEST procedure to log communication outages.

The FAIL TEST procedure shall not be used to log or report problems/outages of physical VTABS

equipment, i.e., VDM’s, foot switches, etc.

2-14

1/1/2023

c. Security.

ZTL 7230.2Q

1. Authorized Air Traffic VTABS users shall be assigned a logic profile consisting of a

user name, password, and appropriate class marks.  This login profile shall be requested through the

ZTL-510 Office.  User names and passwords shall be personally unique.

2. Each supervisor/manager shall utilize his/her login when conducting any assigned

control room duties.

3. Each user, with the exception of the DEO, shall be assigned one, and only one, unique

login.  Each individual shall use his/her individual login when accessing VTABS.  Each individual

shall be responsible for maintaining security of their user name and password and shall report any

suspected compromise of that integrity to the ZTL-510 Office and receive another login.

d. Equipment Verification.  The monthly VTABS preventative maintenance (PM) shall be

performed on the midnight shift.  The date and time will be coordinated through the SOC.  The

SOC will confirm the transition with the WD prior to transition.  During the PM, the control room

shall operate utilizing VTABS as the primary communications system for a minimum of one hour.

Note: Verify all sectors are using main or standby transmitters/receivers instead of BUEC

transmitters/receivers. If unable to transition to main/standby transmitters/receivers advise Tech

Ops that we will be unable to transition to VTABS. This is because VTABS does not support the

use of BUECs.

e. Transition.

1. In the event a problem occurs with VSCS, the controller shall notify the supervisor and

exhaust all resources through VSCS (i.e., main/standby, backup emergency communication

(BUEC), reconfigurations, etc.) to resolve the problem.  The supervisor shall notify the WD of the

situation.

2. The WD shall coordinate with the SOC to determine if a transition to VTABS is

necessary.  When a determination is made to transition to VTABS, the WD shall notify the TMU,

Flight Data, and the other supervisors of the transition time.

3. After transition to VTABS, a pink banner will be displayed at all D-position VDMs.  The

message “VTABS PEM now operational” will not time out after 30 seconds like other system

messages.  This message must be acknowledged by the CPC, and until acknowledged, will prevent

any other message from being received at that position.

4. Once operational on VTABS, only the D-side will have communication capability.

Therefore, if the sector requires two controllers, it will be necessary to operate the position in the

Split Mode configuration.

(a) To enable Split Mode, you must have a headset/handset plugged into each Dual Jack

Module (DJM).  Once both DJMs have a headset/handset plugged in, Split Mode may be enabled

from the Utility Screen or by entering *7 on the VIK.

2-15

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

(b)  Once Split Mode is enabled, the DJM located adjacent to the R-side will have

control of the air-to-ground (A/G) frequencies only.  The DJM furthest away from the R-side will

have control of the ground-to-ground (G/G) only.

5.  The controllers shall ensure the VTABS maps are configured correctly.  That includes

setting up the correct call forward, selecting the appropriate A/G frequencies and ensuring the

appropriate G/G type 9 holler lines are enabled.

6.  Because VTABS saves the last configuration settings the WD shall advise the

supervisors and STMC to ensure that the Call Forwarding is off prior to transitioning back to

VSCS.

f. Transition to VTABS Check List

1.  Plug into the D-side DJM(s)

2.  If two controllers are required, enable Split Mode.

3.  Verify the correct map settings are selected.  If a frequency is on backup emergency

communication (BUEC) on VSCS, BUEC will need to be enabled on VTABS.  If there are

temporary modifications to the VSCS maps, they will need to be added to the VTABS maps from

one of the workstations.

4.  Supervisors report the status of their area to the WD.

g. Transition Back to VSCS Checklist

1.  Disable call forward prior to transitioning.

2.  R-side controller shall unplug from the D-side DJM and plug into the R-side DJM.  Split

Mode will be automatically disabled when both DJMs at the D-side no longer have a

headset/handset plugged into them.

3.  Verify the correct VSCS map settings are selected.  If a frequency is on BUEC on

VTABS, BUEC will need to be enabled on VSCS.  If there are temporary modifications to the

VTABS maps, they will need to be added to the VSCS maps from the supervisor’s workstation.

2-4-5. VSCS MAP CHANGE REQUEST PROCEDURES

a. ZTL Form 7910-1, VSCS Map Change Request (Appendix 12) must be submitted with the

appropriate Map Change Request(s) - ZTL Form 7910-2, VSCS Map Change Request A/G

(Appendix 13) and/or ZTL Form 7910-3, VSCS Map Change Request G/G (Appendix 14).  These

forms may be originated by any employee and shall be submitted to the employee’s immediate

supervisor.  After coordination with the second level supervisor and appropriate employee groups,

the form shall be submitted to the ZTL-510 Office.

2-6-4. NATIONAL NETWORK CONTROL CENTER (NNCC) OUTAGE PROCEDURES

Atlanta ARTC Center Traffic Management (TMU) is the common interface between users and air

traffic facilities underlying ZTL.  National Network Control Center (NNCC) provides flight plan

processing between the National Airspace System (NAS) customer and air traffic.  Loss of the

NNCC system can adversely impact the air traffic system on a national scale.

When NNCC is unable to provide flight plan processing due to emergency or temporary outage

situations, the following procedures apply:

a. ZTL TMU will act as the focal point for flight plan input strategies.  During an NNCC

outage, ZTL TMU/Flight Data will assume responsibility for ensuring the manual input of flight

plan information, for flights originating in ZTL airspace, into the ERAM computer system for

electronic dissemination to the common underlying air traffic control facilities.  ZTL TMU/Flight

Data will collect flight information provided by the users and distribute the information for manual

input into ERAM.

b. Input of flight information into ERAM will begin in the ZTL TMU/Flight Data using

available TMU personnel and ERAM ATSW.  If the workload exceeds the capabilities of ZTL

TMU, then the workload will be divided and distributed under the direction of the STMC/TMCIC

as necessary.

2-6-5. SUBMITTING AN UNFAVORABLE CONDITION REPORT (UCR)

a. The Originator shall submit the UCR to their supervisor.  When submitting a UCR, if

possible, offer a proposed solution.

b. The Immediate Supervisor shall:

1.  Determine if the reported condition is covered under established guidelines in JO 1800.6.

If the condition is not covered, the supervisor should assist the originator, through other means, in

addressing the concern.

2.  Notify their Area OM that a UCR has been received.

2-21

ZTL 7230.2Q

3.  Either log the UCR into the Safety Management Information System (SMIS) or Hand

carry the UCR report to the ZTL-510 Office for logging.

4.  Ensure a copy of the submitted UCR record has been provided to the originator.

c. ZTL-510 shall:

1.  Input the UCR and the response into the SMIS.  Assign the UCR to the appropriate staff

office when necessary.

2.  Track the progress of the UCR to ensure timely handling of the report.

3.  Forward UCR’s to the next higher level when control of the problem or ability to resolve

the issue does not reside at a specific level.

4.  Administratively close all invalid UCR’s in SMIS.

5.  Ensure that each UCR is objectively evaluated and acted upon within the required

timeframe.

d. The Assigned Support Manager’s Office shall:

1.  Investigate and complete a response to the UCR report.

2.  Be the focal for all communications with the originator regarding updates, status,

resolution and/or closure of the UCR.

3.  Either input the information into SMIS or prepare a response on plain white bond paper.

The response shall include the UCR number, the facility name, the name and title of the supervisor,

and the date of the evaluation.  This supplemental response shall become part of the UCR report

and must be completed within 10 calendar days.  If a response cannot be made within the 10

calendar days, the originator must be notified.

NOTE:  Provide ZTL-510 with copies of any interim responses or additional information.

2-6-6 OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN

In accordance with JO 7210.3, 2-1-7, the Air Traffic Manager must develop and maintain

guidelines to provide continuity of required services during planned and, to the degree possible,

during unplanned outages. To accomplish this, a collaboration between Air Traffic Services and

Technical Operations (Tech Ops) must occur utilizing an Operational Risk Management Plan

a. In order of priority, the following types of flight data require expeditious handling:

1.  Active Flight Plans

2.  Amendments

3.  Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS)

4.  Traffic Management Initiatives

5.  Other Messages

b. The following procedures shall be used when manually processing flight data:

1.  During an NNCC outage, ZTL TMU/Flight Data will assume responsibility for ensuring

the manual input of flight plan information of flights originating in ZTL airspace. ZTL TMU/Flight

Data will collect flight information provided by the users and distribute the information for manual

input into the ERAM computer system for electronic dissemination to the common underlying air

traffic control facilities.

2.  The first ZTL sector that receives flight plan information shall create a strip for that sector

and the next applicable sector.  The second strip shall be passed to the next sector prior to handoff.

That receiving sector shall create a new strip for the next sector and pass it on prior to handoff,

continuing this pattern as the aircraft transitions ZTL airspace.

3.  Unused strip bays are stored in the black file cabinets located behind TMU and in the

spill-out area.

f. Departures will normally use the MARSA concept.  If MARSA is not desired, the phrase

“request standard ATC (air traffic control) separation” will be stated when requesting clearance or

specified by the AMC Command Post.

g. When MARSA is not applicable, controllers shall apply standard departure separation

between “Buggy Ride” aircraft and provide priority handling over other non-participating aircraft.

h. In order to assist “Buggy Ride” aircraft, ATC may, as its option or on the request of the pilot,

vector or adjust the altitude of each aircraft as necessary.

i. Under emergency conditions, if “Buggy Ride” aircraft depart with less than standard ATC

separation, aircraft will proceed along the preplanned routes.  In this case, MARSA shall apply

between “Buggy Ride” aircraft from point of departure, via the approved route, until approved

separation is established by the aircraft and acknowledged by ATC.

j. Aircraft will orbit in the maneuver area until appropriate instructions are received.  Each

aircraft will obtain individual clearances from ATC prior to departing the “Buggy Ride” route.

3-12

affected area.

3-14

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

NOTE:  NOTAM cancellations are automatically received by ERIDS at all positions that received

the original NOTAM, so no manual dissemination of cancellations is needed to Atlanta Center

ERIDS positions.

3.  The area OSIC’s shall:

(a)  Monitor ERIDS to ensure that new NOTAMs are reviewed in a timely manner,

including pertinent NOTAMs for part-time approach controls.

(b)  When notified by Flight Data of a new NOTAM, review the NOTAM at the areas

ERIDS supervisor workstation.  Using the ERIDS Messages function, disseminate the NOTAM to

appropriate ERIDS sectors (including sectors overlying part-time approach control airspace).

NOTE:  Avoid distributing NOTAMs to sectors where they are not needed; once distributed,

NOTAMs cannot be deleted from an ERIDS sector until the US NOTAM Office cancels them.

4.  ATCS’s must:

(a)  Monitor ERIDS to ensure that new NOTAMs are reviewed in a timely manner.

(b)  When assuming additional airspace, resector ERIDS to ensure that all pertinent

NOTAMs are displayed on the ERIDS home page.

(c)  Ensure that all pertinent NOTAM information is reviewed during each Transfer of

Position Responsibility, including when airspace is transferred to or received from another sector or

facility.

(d)  Before issuing an approach clearance, review the NOTAMs on the airport’s

NOTAMs tab and the NOTAMs for any NAVAIDs that are used in completing the approach

procedure.  Ensure that the aircraft is aware of any abnormal operation of approach and landing

aids, and of destination airport conditions that might restrict an approach or landing.

c. Procedures to be used during an ERIDS NOTAM system outage:

1.  When advised by the SOC of an ERIDS outage affecting NOTAM distribution, the WD

shall advise Flight Data and each area OSIC.

2.  FDCS must:

(a)  Monitor AISR for all new FDC NOTAMs and NOTAM cancellations applicable to

Atlanta Center areas of operation (including approach control areas assumed by Atlanta Center on

the midnight shift), and

(b)  Deliver a copy of the FDC NOTAM or NOTAM cancellation to the OSIC of each

affected area; and log the NOTAM or NOTAM cancellation on the FDC NOTAM Log.  (On the

midnight shift, deliver a copy for each affected area to the WD.)

3.  Operations Supervisor must:

3-15

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

(a)  Advise controllers of an ERIDS NOTAM system outage.

(b)  Obtain an area specific NOTAM summary from AISR, and post pertinent NOTAM

information on each active sector in the area.  Repeat this process at the beginning of each shift

until advised that the ERIDS NOTAM system has returned to service.  Maintain a record of the

NOTAM information posted in the area.  (This may be accomplished by retaining a copy of a

NOTAM GI message posted in the area.)

(c)  When advised by Flight Data of a new FDC NOTAM or NOTAM cancellation,

update any pertinent information on the record of NOTAM information and on active sectors in the

area.

d. Recovering from an ERIDS NOTAM system outage:

1.  WD advises Flight Data and each area’s OSIC that the ERIDS NOTAM system is

operational.

2.  FDCS checks ERIDS for unprocessed FDC NOTAMs that have a Location ID other than

an airport or NAVAID (ZTL, ZZZ, FDC, etc.) and distribute them to the ERIDS Supervisory

workstations as needed.  Advise the OSIC in each affected area.

3.  Operations Supervisors advise controllers that the ERIDS NOTAM system has returned

to service, and remove printed NOTAM information from each sector.

3-5-3. RECORDING OF AIRBORNE DELAYS

a. National directives require the reporting of all air traffic delays in increments of 15 minutes.

b. The Traffic Management Officer (TMO), Atlanta ARTCC Air Traffic Management Unit

(TMU) is responsible for reviewing all current and future automated delay reporting products.

directives.  The WD is the initial Investigator-In-Charge for all incidents and accidents occurring

within ZTL airspace.

3-17

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

3-6-2. SIMILAR SOUNDING CALL SIGNS

Operations Supervisors must enter similar sounding call signs (SSCS) into the following website

https://ksn2.faa.gov/ATO/AJT-BURST-Team-Tools/SSCS/SitePages/Home.aspx.  A link is

provided in CEDAR for easy access.  Alternatively, SSCS may be submitted to ZTL530 office via

ZTL Form 7210-43, Similar Sounding Call Sign Incident Reporting Worksheet, Appendix 28.  The

associated flight progress strips or copies denoting the aircraft involved must be attached to the

form for processing and/or information purposes. ZTL530 tracks SSCS incidents via the local

access network database and provides processing progress and airline responses as appropriate.

3-6-3. AUTOMATION / PROCEDURAL PROBLEM REPORT (APPR)

ZTL Form 7210-44, Automation / Procedural Problem Report, Appendix 29, should be used to

report suspected problems with ERAM automation, ERIDS information or operational problems of

an airspace, procedural, and/or military nature.  Blank APPR forms are available at the Watch Desk

(WD) and an automated copy is located in the Forms section of the N Drive.  When completing an

APPR, the originator should fill in all applicable items on the form describing the problem with as

much detail as possible.  The form should then be forwarded to the OSIC who will review the issue,

ensuring it is not an operational issue that requires immediate attention.  If there is a question as to

whether or not the issue is an operational one, the WD should be consulted to ensure appropriate

and timely investigation and reporting of suspected events. The OSIC should fill in their portion of

the form and forward to ZTL-530. ZTL-530 will investigate the reported problem.  If appropriate,

ZTL-530 will transmit the APPR to the Field Automation Support Team (FAST) via the

Automation Information Management System (AIMS).  ZTL-530 will route findings through the

Operations Supervisor (OS) whose name is on the form.

3-6-4. AIRSPACE INTRUSIONS.

a. Airspace Intrusion results when an aircraft enters Class A and B airspace without

authorization, or Class C or Class D airspace without establishing communications with ATC, or

Special Use Airspace.

b. WD personnel must complete a MOR, and make the necessary log entries, if an airspace

intrusion is identified and ZTL is the controlling agency.  The entry shall include, as a minimum,

the sector/facility from which a handoff was received, method of identification, if any, and landing

point or subsequent sector/facility if a handoff was made.

c. In the event that an aircraft violates Class B airspace, Class C airspace, Class D airspace, or a

restricted area and the affected facility is unable to identify the aircraft, assistance will be requested

from other facilities through which the aircraft flies.

d. When a target is identified as a possible violator, control personnel shall start tracking the

aircraft using the aircraft call sign, if known.

3-18

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

e. If the call sign is not known, start a track using an acronym for the facility that observed the

violation, the type of airspace violated, plus the number of the ZTL sector initiating the track.  As

an example:

1.  Charlotte Tower advises Sector 31 of Class B violator = CLTB31

2.  Atlanta ARTCC Sector 21 observes a Restricted Area violator = ZTLR21

3.  Montgomery Tower advises Sector 13 of a Class D violator = MGMD13

f. Continue to monitor the aircraft on radar and attempt to determine the aircraft’s identification,

if unknown, and destination.  Notify the OSIC/CIC as soon as practicable.

g. The aircraft's target must be continuously monitored while within ZTL’s airspace by passing

the target identity from sector to sector.  If the target appears to be entering an adjacent facility’s

airspace, a radar handoff shall be accomplished to that facility.  An advisory shall be given each

facility regarding the violation in question.

3-6-5. TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS (TFR)

ZTL Forms 7230-29-1, 7230-29-2, and 7230-29-3, Temporary Flight Restriction Worksheets,

Appendixes 23, 24, and 25, should be used to report temporary flight restrictions.  There has been a

number of TFR’s posted in ZTL airspace recently due to the increased security measures

implemented in response to terrorist threats.  The following is an attempt to explain the different

types of TFR's and to clarify our coordination responsibilities.

TFR's are defined in Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (FAR's) Part 91, Section 137, and are

posted by NOTAM's and designated an (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) TFR as follows:

a.  The Administrator will issue a NOTAM designating an area within which temporary flight

restrictions apply and specifying the hazard or condition requiring their imposition, whenever

deemed necessary in order to;

1.  Protect persons and property on the surface or in the air from a hazard associated with an

incident on the surface;

2.  Provide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft; or

3.  Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing and other aircraft above an incident or event,

which may generate a high degree of public interest.

b. The NOTAM will specify the hazard or condition that requires the imposition of temporary

flight restrictions."

c. Generally, (a)(1) TFR's are so designated for areas where a risk to the flying public may exist

due to explosive devices, or other such dangers.  When an (a) (1) TFR is issued, the area is

3-19

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

sterilized of all flights other than those with explicit permission to operate within the area.  ATC

has no authority to allow aircraft to transit the area without expressed consent from the using

agency.

d. An (a)(2) TFR generally is so designated to prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing

aircraft over an incident or event, which may generate a high degree of public interest.  FAR Part

91.137, paragraph 3(c):  "When a NOTAM has been issued under paragraph (a) (2) of this section,

no person may operate an aircraft within the designated area unless at least one of the following

conditions is met:

1.  The aircraft is participating in hazard relief activities and is being operated under the

direction of the official in charge of on scene emergency response activities.

2.  The aircraft is carrying law enforcement officials.

3.  The aircraft is operating under the ATC approved IFR flight plan.

4.  The operation is conducted directly to or from an airport within the area, or is

necessitated by the impracticability of VFR flight above or around the area due to weather, or

terrain; notification is given to the Flight Service Station (FSS) or ATC facility specified in the

NOTAM to receive advisories concerning disaster relief aircraft operations; and the operation does

not hamper or endanger relief activities and is not conducted for the purpose of observing the

disaster.

5.  The aircraft is carrying properly accredited news representatives, and prior to entering

the area, a flight plan is filed with the appropriate FAA or ATC Facility specified in the NOTAM

and the operation is conducted above the altitude used by the disaster relief aircraft, unless

otherwise authorized by the official in charge of on scene emergency response activities."

e. An (a) (3) TFR generally is so designated to prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing

aircraft over an incident or event, which may generate a high degree of public interest.  FAR Part

91.137, paragraph 3(d):  "When a NOTAM has been issued under paragraph (a) (3) of this section,

no person may operate an aircraft within the designated area unless at least one of the following

conditions is met:

1.  The operation is conducted directly to or from an airport within the area, or is

necessitated by the impracticability of VFR flight above or around the area due to weather or

terrain, and the operation is not conducted for the purpose of observing the incident or event.

2.  The aircraft is operating under an ATC approved IFR flight plan.

3.  The aircraft is carrying incident or event personnel, or law enforcement officials.

4.  The aircraft is carrying properly accredited news representatives, and prior to entering

that area, a flight plan is filed with the appropriate FSS or ATC facility specified in the NOTAM.

3-20

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

f. Flight plans filed and notifications made with an FSS or ATC facility under this section shall

include the following information:

1. Aircraft identification, type and color.

2. Radio communications frequencies to be used.

3. Proposed times of entry into, and exit from, the designated area.

4. Name of news media or organization and purpose of flight.

5. Any other information requested by “ATC."

TFR's are designated by NOTAM's, and as such, compliance is the pilot's responsibility.  Except for

TFR's designated as (a) (1), ATC maintains the authority to authorize operations with TFR's,

provided the operations do not hamper or interfere with the event for which the TFR was

implemented.

Other flight restrictions concerning Hawaiian airspace, the movement of the President, Vice

President, other public figures, and providing security for space agency operations are covered

under FAR Part 91, Sections 138, 141, and 143 respectively.

3-6-6. 3 MILE SEPARATION AREAS

The entirety of ZTL is adapted for reduced separation at and below FL230, using RADAR +

ADSB, and ADSB only sensors. Lincolnton Long Range, Marietta Long Range, Maiden Long

Range, Augusta Airport Surveillance, Charlotte Airport Surveillance, Greensboro Airport

Surveillance, Macon Airport Surveillance, Lawrenceville Surveillance, Greer Airport Surveillance,

Tri-City Airport Surveillance, Lynch Long Range, Crossville Long Range, and Montgomery Long

Range Radars are adapted as Single Sensor Sites for ZTL. To supplement cones of silence, and

areas outside of RADAR coverage, ADSB has been adapted within ZTL for reduced separation to

fill gaps. Coverage areas are defined per figure 1, 2 and 3.

3-6-7. FLAT/FREE TRACK STATUS.

When a tracked aircraft is vectored off-course or deviates, for any reason, the track may enter free

track status.  Automatic time updates and automatic handoffs are inhibited when an aircraft is in

free track status.  Additionally, strip generation to proper sectors may be affected by a track in free

track status.  Therefore, controllers should update the route of flight in the ERAM computer to

ensure flat track mode of operation.  Unless an operational advantage is gained and coordination is

accomplished, the ERAM computer data base shall be correct before handoff or control transfer of

an aircraft to an adjacent sector/facility.

3-6-8. COORDINATION PROCEDURES FOR FLIP-FLOP AIRSPACE

a. There are several areas inside ZTL where airspace is assigned to a particular sector

depending on the direction of takeoff and landing at Atlanta/Hartsfield and Charlotte/Douglas

Airports.  These areas include the low altitude airspace overlying the Atlanta/Hartsfield Airport, the

Athens West Departure Area, and the Gadsden East Area.

b. The transferring controller shall ensure that the receiving controller has a handoff or point out

on all affected aircraft.  When the airspace is transferred to another position, using the Position

Relief Checklist, the controllers affected shall ensure that all pertinent flight plan and sector

information has been coordinated.

3-6-9. SECTOR BINDERS

a. It is the responsibility of the WD, Supervisor’s Committee (SUPCOM), TMU, and the FDCS

ZTL 7230.2Q

3-6-11. INAPPROPRIATE ALTITUDE FOR DIRECTION OF FLIGHT (IAFDOF)

When both the transferring and receiving sectors are within ZTL, “inappropriate altitude for

direction of flight” need not be coordinated when:

a. The aircraft’s assigned altitude is above or below the altitude limits of the receiving sector, or

b. The aircraft is climbing to an interim altitude which is the highest altitude of either the

transferring or receiving sector, or

c. The aircraft is descending to an interim altitude, which is the lowest altitude of either the

transferring or receiving sector.

3-6-12. TIME-BASED FLOW MANAGEMENT

The use of time-based flow management in the NAS allows for the precise metering of aircraft to

the airport. In order to distribute the delay across multiple sectors, it is necessary to define the

maximum number of delay minutes an area or sector can pass to the next controller. Controllers

must comply with the time restrictions defined by Appendix 52, Time-Based Flow Management

(TBFM) Delay Values.

3-6-13. PRE-ARRANGED COORDINATION PROCEDURES (P-ACP)

1. In order to utilize pre-arranged coordination procedures identified in #3, the following

conditions must be met:

a. ERAM must be fully operational.

b. The authorized sector must “quick look” the owning sector and maintain display of the

owning sector’s data blocks while utilizing the airspace.

c. The authorized sector is responsible to provide radar separation, including wake

turbulence separation, from all applicable traffic when utilizing this procedure.

d. The authorized sector must PVD the data block of the aircraft transitioning the airspace to

the owning sector.

2. If any of the above requirements are not met or at the request of either sector controller or

area supervisor, this procedure is cancelled and individual coordination is required.

3.  The following pre-arranged coordination procedures are approved within ZTL:

a. Sector 44 is authorized to control CLT departures assigned the JOJJO SID within the

confines of Sector 47 airspace in that area above CLT ATCT airspace without individual

coordinated, sectors 31, 44, and 47 will delete the published speed prior to communications transfer

to the next ZTL sector.

3-6-16. ABRR/PDRR

(1)  ABRR/PDRR functionality gives local TMCs the ability to send route amendments from

TFMS directly to ERAM. ERAM then forwards the amendment to the controlling sector for

airborne aircraft or departure facility for flight plan proposals, as appropriate.

(2)  The ABRR/PDRR protected segment:

(a)  is the portion of the reroute that is important for achieving the goal of the TMI,

(b)  is protected from automation processing for adapted routings,

(c)  should not be amended by the sector controller, if possible,

(d)  does not prevent a controller from executing a route amendment that would alter the

protected segment or any other portion of the route, when necessary.

(3)  TMU responsibilities:

(a)  Use ABRR/PDRR to send TMI reroutes to ERAM, whenever feasible.

3-26

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

(b)  Utilize protected segments as much as practical, so as to provide datablock/EDST

indications of reroutes as often as possible.

(4)  Communication responsibilities:

(a)  TMU must advise OSIC/CIC verbally that an ABRR has been sent.

NOTE:  When an ABRR is required of a sector in red alert status, the ABRR will be

sent after coordination with OSIC/CIC.

(b)  When a national reroute is cancelled, TMU must notify the affected areas/facilities.

(c)  If a controller rejects a reroute for any reason, this information, including the reason,

must be coordinated with TMU.

(d)  When an ABRR is required, TMU must ensure the sector team has a reasonable

opportunity to issue the route prior to handoff.  If a short notice ABRR is required, and the aircraft

is in close proximity to the normal handoff point, TMU will verbally coordinate with the OSIC/CIC

prior to sending the ABRR.

Regardless of who is staffing the position, in this directive, WD will be utilized to identify the

position.  When the STMC position is not staffed, it is combined at the WD.

b. The WD is the second level of operational supervision for the Controller Work Force.  In

most cases, the WD is directly involved with controller or controller family emergencies, deaths,

and possible illnesses.

c. If the FDCS is not available due to an authorized break or unforeseen reason, the position is

combined with the STMC or the WD.  During those times that the position is combined, the

STMC/WD shall answer phones, address questions, and amend flight plans to the extent available

at the ATSW.  STMC/WD are not expected to complete all FDCS assigned responsibilities.  FDCS

are always subject to recall when on break.

4-1-2. GENERAL DUTIES

a. The WD is the initial Investigator-In-Charge for all incidents and accidents occurring within

ZTL airspace.

b. The WD acts as the liaison between Air Traffic and the SOC.  These duties include planning

Section 2.  Duties

6-2-1. PROCEDURES

a. INPUT/OUTPUT RESPONSE MESSAGES

1.  Air traffic control messages are input into the ERAM computer via five acceptable

sources.

(a)  Remote (ATSW); i.e., FSS, AFSS, BASEOPS, Air Carriers, and DUAT Vendors

(b)  Local (ATSW); in-house

(c)  Inter - center (NAS to NAS)

(d)  Remote flight data input/output (FDIO)

2.  The computer will respond to each flight plan message with an acceptance, rejection, or

error message.

3.  A computer response to a flight plan message is normally routed to the originating

source.  The ATSW is the primary routing for field 00 errors, weather format errors, unsuccessful

transmission errors, and unprocessable-no-postable-fix errors.

4.  If the computer is unable to route a response to the originator, a backup is designated to

receive it.  The ATSW is the backup device for remote ATSW’s, Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO)

facilities, and some center messages.

5.  Request to Remove Strip or Amend Flight Plan Data:

(a)  Request flight plan readout.

(b)  If the flight is active, inform the requesting source that they need to contact the

appropriate sector to remove or amend the flight plan.

(c) Any AM to a flight plan that is requested by the aircraft owner/operator/air traffic

control facility/FSS shall be made any time before the aircraft has been assigned a discreet

transponder code in the flight plan. Once a transponder code is assigned, Flight Data Specialists

must coordinate with the appropriate tower controller before making amendments or removing

flight plans. This applies to ATL and CLT Approach Controls only.

6.  The flight plan was successfully transmitted to the computer, but the message contained

an error.  An error response may or may not have been transmitted to the remote facility, dependent

6-2

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

upon station adaptation.  An adapted station receives error messages and non-adapted stations

receive automatic “rogers”.  If the station is a non-adapted station, the computer will route a

“referred error-time out” to the ATSW.

(a) Request flight plan readout.

(b)  If the sending facility has not corrected the error, notify them via a service message

of the error, time permitting, and have them correct and resend or advise them the flight plan is not

for ZTL.  Cancel the error message with (CR CXX).

(c)  An amendment to the route or altitude of a flight plan may be requested by the

aircraft owner/operator, air traffic control facility or FSS and shall be made before the aircraft has

been assigned a discreet transponder code. Proposed departure time amendments may be made at

any time.

7.  Referred Error: After a “Referred Error” occurs, the FDCS has ten (10) minutes to correct

or cancel the error or a “Referred Reject” will be sent to the SAA ATSW.  The specialist then has

to notify the sender to resend the flight plan or type the flight plan into the computer or resend

through the AISR System.

8.  Reject - 00 (Address Field:  If the computer cannot determine the source of an

unacceptable input, the input is rejected and routed to the ATSW.

(a)  The FDCS shall advise the sending facility of the error, time permitting, and have

them correct and resend or advise them the flight plan is not for ZTL.

(b)  If the flight plan is time critical (within 30 minutes or less) and belongs to ZTL, the

FDCS shall reenter the flight plan message to ensure acceptance by the computer.

9.  Duplicate Message Reject (Active and Proposed):

(a)  Reject: This type of error response is generated when an active flight is in the

computer and an adjacent facility tries to pass another flight plan (active) with the same AID.

No action required by FDCS.

(b)  Processed:  This message is output when two or more proposed flight plans (FP’s)

with the same call sign and departure point are entered into the computer and fields 07 or 10 are

different.

(1)  If the proposed departure strips have not been printed and the proposed

departure times and en route times show that both FP’s can be flown, no action is required.

(2)  If the proposed departure strips have not been printed and the proposed

departure times and en route times show that both FP’s cannot be flown, cancel the FP entered first

(usually the bottom FP) and add an overcast symbol with FRC in field 11 of the remaining FP.

(c)  If the proposed departure strips have been printed, coordinate the removal of one of

the FP’s with the appropriate facility/sector.

6-3

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

10.  Referred Accept - Long Remarks:  This message is output when the flight plan is more

than 400 characters in length.

(a)  Request a flight plan readout.

(b) If the flight plan was accepted by the computer, the strip will be truncated.

(c)  A flight plan with a route of flight that exceeds 400 characters is too long to forward

NAS to NAS and must be reduced in size before the departure strip can be printed.

(d)  The FDCS shall enter the FP and insert T in the remarks section.  FDCS shall retain

all FP information.

11.  Referred Reject - Amendment Pending:  This message is received when the sector or

tower is making an amendment.

(a)  Request flight plan readout.

(b)  Wait until the amending source, sector, or tower completes the amendment.  If you

still need to make the amendment, you may do so in approximately 5 minutes.  If the 40-minute

time limit is applicable, coordinate AM’s with sector/facility.

12.  Unsuccessful Transmission Message:  ERAM is programmed to route all FP’s to the

adapted sector.  Should the transfer of a FP be inhibited either by program or hardware, the

program will route an Unsuccessful Transmission Message (UTM) to the SUP-A ATSW.

13.  Reject - Duplicate Action:  This message will output when more than one request

message (RQ) is entered into the WMSC circuit within a 60-second interval.  Wait one minute, and

make the request again.

14.  Weather Observations - Rejected/Altimeter Rejected:  The “Accept WX-Reject

Altimeter” message will output if the weather report is missing/wrong time; sequence format error;

incorrect or missing altimeter; or altimeter changed +/- .04.

(a)  The specialist shall obtain the correct weather/altimeter and enter into the ERAM

ATSW, making certain the altimeter is accepted.

(b)  Other Responses.

(1)  Accept WX AS 999 AMG First (No Action).

(2)  Accept WX AS 999 LOZ Last (No Action).

ZTL 7230.2Q

CHAPTER 21. HUMAN RESOURCES AND SERVICES

21-1-1.  TRAUMATIC INJURIES

For the protection of the employee, all injuries, regardless of severity, should be reported.

An injury may appear minor at the time of occurrence but later develop into a more

serious condition.  Unless the procedures outlined here are followed, compensation may

be denied. OWCP is the authority over all claims. In order to expedite the processing of

on-the-job injuries, the following procedures must be followed.

a.  Notification of Injury.  Form CA-1, Federal Employee’s Notice of Traumatic

Injury and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation, is to be completed promptly. In

addition, a memorandum will be given to the employee addressing his/her

responsibilities.

1.  Employee Responsibilities. The employee should notify his immediate

supervisor, or the supervisor-in-charge, at the time an on-the-job injury occurs and

written notification should be accomplished within 24 hours, or as soon as possible.

Obtain Form CA-1 from the supervisor and complete Items 1 through 16.

2.  Supervisor Responsibilities. The supervisor is responsible for assisting the

injured employee in completing the form. The supervisor must complete the “Receipt of

Notice of Injury” on the instruction sheet attached to the CA-1, and give it to the

employee. Obtain a statement from the witness, if any, in Item 16 and complete the back

of Form CA-1, Items 17 through 38. Have the injured employee, or his representative,

and the witness sign the CA-1 and forward it to ZTL-10 within 2 days.

b.  Immediate Medical Treatment.

1.  If immediate medical treatment is needed, the employee may go to any

physician or hospital within 25 miles of the facility or his/her home. If necessary, the

supervisor should arrange for transportation to receive emergency medical treatment.

2.  The supervisor will issue Form CA-16, Request for Examination and

Treatment, and complete Part A. (If there is doubt the injury is job connected and caused

by accident, Form CA-16 must be issued with an indication in Block 6B).  If impractical

to complete this form at the time of injury, it must be completed no later than 48 hours

following the injury. After the supervisor completes Part A, a copy of the CA-16 (both

sides) should be made before it is given to the employee. The copy should be forwarded

to ZTL-10.

3.  The employee will either take these forms with him/her to obtain treatment or

he/she will mail them to the appropriate physician or hospital. Form HCFA-1500 must

also be issued with the CA-16 to be completed by physician. The employee should be

advised that bills not submitted on Form HCFA-1500, or its equivalent, will be returned

21-1

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

to the physician for resubmission.  The physician or hospital must sign the form with

their Employee Identification Number or Tax Identification Number shown in Item 33. It

is the employee's responsibility to submit sufficient medical evidence (CA-16) within 10

workdays after starting Continuation of Pay (COP), or COP may be terminated.

c.  Continuation of Pay.

1.  If an employee is disabled for work as a result of a work-related injury and

filed a CA-1 within 30 days of the injury, they may be entitled to receive COP. COP is

paid for up to 45 calendar days of disability and is not charged against sick or annual

leave. It is the employee’s responsibility to submit sufficient medical evidence within 10

workdays after starting COP, or COP may be terminated. Time taken as COP must be

medically justified, in writing, by their physician and medical documentation must be

submitted on an on-going basis as COP is being used.

2.  COP will not be granted, or will be stopped, if the employee does not report

the injury on a CA-1 form within 30 days, and/or if the agency has not received medical

evidence of the injury within 10 workdays of the injury or after the employee claims

COP, whichever is later.

3.  The claimant’s entitlement to COP may be used for up to 45 calendar days due

to the disability and/or medical treatment after a traumatic injury. The supervisor is

responsible for keeping a record of the number of calendar days and/or hours the injured

employee is in COP status. If the employee is still expected to be absent from work (due

to this injury), after completion/termination of COP, any lost time will be charged to sick

leave, annual leave, or leave without pay (LWOP).

4.  There are two definitions of controverting the claim. The first is to deny a

person's right to COP based on one of nine reasons listed on the CA-1 form. The second

is to dispute the claim based on questionable circumstances.

(a)  Denying COP Payments. There are nine legally authorized reasons for

which the FAA can deny COP when a CA-1 claim is filed. This should be indicated in

Item 35 on the CA-1. COP can also be terminated if the employee does not provide

sufficient medical documentation within 10 working days and COP or excused time

granted converted to the employee’s leave. Also, all COP and excused leave on the date

of injury must be withdrawn if a claim is denied.

(b)  Disputing the Claim. The agency may dispute any claim until it is

adjudicated by OWCP. The claim might be disputed on the basis that the employee was

not performing an assigned duty when the injury occurred, or that the condition claimed

is not the result of a work-related injury. Any claim for workers' compensation may be

controverted if the supervisor, or other agency official, believes the circumstances

surrounding the claim are of a questionable nature, or the claim does not meet one of the

five conditions of coverage:  time, civil employee (FAA government employee); fact of

injury; performance of duty, and causal relationship. If disputing the claim, indicate in

21-2

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

Item 34 on the CA-1, and provide evidence/justification to OWCP in writing signed by

the supervisor, a manager, the OWCP specialist, or other agency official. If disputing the

claim, the employee is authorized COP, if he/she meets eligibility requirements, until

OWCP adjudicates the claim.

(c)  The CA-1 form clearly states that if the employee's claim is denied, all

time taken for COP must be converted at the employee's option to sick leave, annual

leave, or LWOP. Additionally, excused leave taken on the day of the injury will be

converted.

21-1-2.  MEDICATION REPORT

Each controller/ operational supervisor must submit a request for a clearance to work

while taking medication.  The following procedures will apply:

a.  The OSIC receiving information over the phone concerning medication should

forward the call to the WD. This allows the OSIC to focus on the area instead of an

administrative task.

b.  The WD will complete ZTL Form 3900.1 (Appendix 08-- located on the N drive,

public directory, Forms Folder).

c.  During administrative hours, the WD will normally forward the form to ZTL-10

for a medical determination. This allows the WD to focus on the control room instead of

an administrative task.

d.  ZTL-10 will coordinate with ASO-300 for a medical determination.

e.  After administrative hours, the WD will contact the Regional Flight Surgeon

(RFS) through the C-ROC for a medical determination. If the medical determination is

needed after 8:00 PM on a weekday, or anytime during the weekend, the WD must first

coordinate with either the ATM or XO prior to calling the RFS.

f.  Ensure the ATCS is notified of the medical determination, and completes the

remainder of the form as a matter of facility record. (Forward all forms to ZTL-10 for

retention.)

21-1-3.  MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS FOR ATC PERSONNEL

a.  ZTL-10 Responsibilities. ZTL-10 will distribute the roster of employees due a

employee should check the list of authorized Aviation Medical Examiners (AME),

provided in each area/Watch Desk and call to make an appointment. Control room

personnel should be notified no later than ten days after the watch schedule is posted.

Any operational constraints making certain days unavailable should be discussed at this

time. This notification should normally occur during administrative hours so employees

can immediately make their appointments.

2.  OSs must collect from their employees the scheduled date, time, and AME

for the examination.

3.  OSs will ensure this information is reported to ZTL-10 so proper authorization

forms can be prepared.

4.  OSs must indicate on the watch schedule, next to the employee’s name, the

time of the physical and the AME’s name.

5.  OSs are encouraged to remind employees they must take the proper forms with

them to the physical.

c.  Employee Responsibilities. Employees are responsible for contacting an AME on

the authorized list provided in each area and scheduling their medical examination.

1.  Employees must schedule the medical examination to be during their

scheduled shifts. The employee will notify their OS of any scheduling problems

encountered.

2.  Employees must schedule the medical examination as soon as they

are notified, and as early in the month as operational needs will permit.

3.  Employees must obtain the necessary paperwork from ZTL-10 prior to

leaving for the medical examination (two required forms: (1) AAM-RFS-300-002-F4,

which the AME keeps; (2) FAA Form 3900-7, ATCS Health Program Report by

Examining Physician, which the employee will return to ZTL-10.)

d.  If there is no G-car available, the employee may claim mileage by filing a local

voucher in E2.

e.  The total time allotted for the medical examination, and round trip travel, is 2-½

hours. Medical examinations at the beginning or end of the shift may not require round

trip travel.

Order JO3450.1H, dated July 24, 2012, Air Traffic Organization’s ATO Awards

Program, covers all employees. Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, OSs will

receive local guidance.

21-1-5.  CHANGES TO EMPLOYEE’S OS OF RECORD

In order to ensure the accuracy of the various database systems in use at the facility,

whenever there is a change to an employee’s OS of record, the OS in charge of the

schedule for that area must make an email notification to the outlook mailing group

“AJE-EE-ZTL-FLM-of-Record. If an employee changes areas, the gaining area

scheduling supervisor must make notification.

21-1-6.  EMPLOYEE EXIT CHECKLIST AND CLOSEOUT

When an employee or contractor departs ZTL for reasons including, but not limited to,

details or transfers to another facility/office/agency outside of ZTL, retirement, or

separation, the employee must complete certain forms and turn in items prior to his or her

departure.

An Employee Exit Checklist can be found in Appendix 40 of this order, as well as in the

shared drive in the Forms folder. Utilize the Employee Exit Checklist to finalize any

employee’s departure from ZTL.

Note: It is important to complete the checklist in order to account for ZTL property and to

ensure that the employee’s retirement pay is not delayed.

21-1-7. TONE INCIDENTS

Unexpected noises of increased volume over land lines or radio frequencies, known as

“tones,” can be encountered during air traffic control duties. These tones can be heard over

headsets, handsets, or speaker systems. Incidents of tones can be distracting or even

temporarily painful to experience. Procedures for reporting and handling tone incidents are

outlined in this section.

1. Roles and Responsibilities.

a.  Employees. Employees subjected to tones should report these events to their

immediate supervisor as soon as possible after the incident. This reporting is

necessary to determine the source of the tone and to ensure that all technical

safeguards are functional.

21-5

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

b.  Supervisors. Supervisors advised of a tone incident must follow the steps as

outlined in Section 2 below. These responsibilities include receiving reports of

tone incidents from operational employees, securing operational positions and

equipment for testing, notifying Technical Operations personnel of the need for

equipment evaluation, making appropriate entries in the facility log, and

ensuring that FAA Form 3900-5, Tone Incident Report, is completed and routed

in accordance with this guidance.

c.  Air Traffic Manager. Air Traffic Managers are responsible for tracking and

processing tone incident reports and ensuring that technical safeguards are in

place to protect their employees. Air Traffic Managers must also follow the steps

outlined in Section 2, coordinating with Technical Operations personnel for

equipment evaluation, ensuring headset systems are tested (if applicable),

monitoring tone incident investigations, and completing necessary reports.

2. Tone Incident Reporting and Processing.

a. Employee Reports a Tone Incident.

1. When an employee reports a tone incident, secure the employee’s headset

for testing as soon as it is operationally feasible to do so. Ensure that Technical Operations

is notified to evaluate the affected operational position and associated NAS equipment for

normal operations as soon as possible. Air Traffic Management will ensure that the

employee’s headset acoustic limiting circuits are functioning properly by using a

Plantronics Varistor check box in accordance with the Plantronics Varistor Check Box User

Guide. Air Traffic Management will also give the affected employee the opportunity to

observe the headset testing. If a Technical Operations employee was involved with the tone

incident, that employee’s manager must also be notified and appropriate actions taken.

2. Make an “E” entry in the facility log and carry entry forward until:

(a) Technical Operations tests console/voice switch/NAS equipment,

and

(b) Air Traffic Manager confirms headset testing (if applicable).

3. In order to facilitate equipment checks, Tech Ops needs to understand

what was going on at the time of the tone incident. Record this information on FAA Form

3900-5, Tone Incident Report, and forward for action and processing.

4. Secure the recording of the tone incident (usually obtained by the SOC). A

copy of the reported tone incident will be provided to the Air Traffic Manager.

5. When equipment testing is complete and cleared, annotate facility log with

the statement, “Tests complete. Equipment operating normally.” Report an abnormal test

results and annotate log appropriately.

6. Complete FAA Form 3900-5. If the employee files Form CA-1, Federal

Employee’s Notice of Traumatic Injury and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation,

retain original FAA Form 3900-5 in a designated facility file for five years. If the employee

21-6

1/1/2023

ZTL 7230.2Q

does not file Form CA-1, retain the original FAA Form 3900-5 for two years. During the

first week of October, report the total number of tone incidents for the fiscal year at your

facility, along with the number of CA-1 tone cases, to AJW-232 at 701-792-4303.

7. Determine if the employee intends to file Form CA-1 and mark Form

3900-5 appropriately. If employee is filing Form CA-1, follow guidance below.

and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation.

1. Follow procedures outlined in 21-1-1a of this order.

2. Advise the employee that the Agency’s position is that our equipment is

designed not to exceed OSHA standards for occupational noise exposure as outlined in 29

CFR 1910.95. If an employee files a claim of permanent injury due to a tone, the FAA will

ensure that the Department of Labor is fully informed of the technical safeguards and

agency’s position.

3. Complete Supervisor’s portion of the CA-1.

(a) Include the statement, “Equipment to be tested to ensure acoustic

limiters are working.”
